In binary search tree	 the nodes are arranged in such a way that the left node is having less data value than root node value and the right nodes are having larger value than that of root. Because of this while searching any node the value of the target node will be compared with the parent node and accordingly either left sub branch or right sub branch will be searched. So	 one has to compare only particular branches. Thus searching becomes efficient."

When a message is received, the receiving system 'j' sets its counter Cj to 1 more than the maximum of its current value and the incoming time-stamp Ti. At each site, the ordering of messages is determined by the following rules: For messages x from site i and y from site j, x precedes y if one of the following conditions holds....(a) if Ti<Tj or (b) if Ti=Tj and i<j."

"What Is The Need For Priority Queue? In a multiuser environment	 the operating system scheduler must decide which of the several processes to run only for a fixed period of time. One algorithm uses queue. Jobs are initially placed at the end of the queue. The scheduler will repeatedly take the first job on the queue	 run it until either it finishes or its time limit is up and place it at the end of the queue if it does not finish. This strategy is not appropriate	 because very short jobs will soon to take a long time because of the wait involved in the run.				Generally	 it is important that short jobs finish as fast as possible	 so these jobs should have precedence over jobs that have already been running. Further more	 some jobs that are not short are still very important and should have precedence. This particular application seems to require a special kind of queue	 known as priority queue. Priority queue is also called as Heap or Binary Heap."

This is due to the reason that a context switch implementation is done by the kernel. During this process the state information is copied between the processor and the PCB (process control block) or the TCB (thread control block). Since the kernel does not know anything about user-level threads, technically it is not possible for it to be a user level thread context switch. The user level scheduler can do some limited state copying on the behalf of a thread prior to the control being handed to that thread. But this copying of state information is smaller compared to that of a kernel-level process. Also the process does not involve going into the kernel mode with the help of a system call."

"what are static blocks and static initalizers in Java ?
Static blocks or static initializers are used to initalize static fields in java. we declare static blocks when we
want to intialize static fields in our class. Static blocks gets executed exactly once when the class is loaded
. Static blocks are executed even before the constructors are executed."
"How to call one constructor from the other constructor ?
With in the same class if we want to call one constructor from other we use this() method. Based on the
number of parameters we pass appropriate this() method is called.
Restrictions for using this method :
1) this must be the first statement in the constructor
2)we cannot use two this() methods in the constructor"
"What is method overriding in java ?
If we have methods with same signature (same name, same signature, same return type) in super class
and subclass then we say
subclass method is overridden by superclass.
When to use overriding in java
If we want same method with different behaviour in superclass and subclass then we go for overriding.
When we call overridden method with subclass reference subclass method is called hiding the superclass
method."
"What is super keyword in java ?
Variables and methods of super class can be overridden in subclass . In case of overriding , a subclass
object call its own variables and methods. Subclass cannot access the variables and methods of
superclass because the overridden variables or methods hides the methods and variables of super class.
But still java provides a way to access super class members even if its members are overridden. Super is
used to access superclass variables, methods, constructors.
Super can be used in two forms :
1) First form is for calling super class constructor.
2) Second one is to call super class variables,methods.
Super if present must be the first statement."
"Difference between method overloading and method overriding in java ?
Method Overloading Method Overriding
1) Method Overloading occurs with in the same
class
Method Overriding occurs between
two classes superclass and subclass
2) Since it involves with only one class inheritance
is not involved.
Since method overriding occurs between superclass
and subclass inheritance is involved.
3)In overloading return type need not be the same 3) In overriding return type must be same.
4) Parameters must be different when we do
overloading
4) Parameters must be same.
5) Static polymorphism can be acheived using
method overloading
5) Dynamic polymorphism can be acheived using
method overriding.
6) In overloading one method cant hide the
another
6) In overriding subclass method hides that of the
superclass method."
"Difference between abstract class and interface ?
Interface Abstract Class
1) Interface contains only abstract methods 1) Abstract class can contain abstract methods,
concrete methods or both
2) Access Specifiers for methods in interface
must be public
2) Except private we can have any access
specifier for methods in abstract class.
3) Variables defined must be public , static ,
final
3) Except private variables can have any access
specifiers
4) Multiple Inheritance in java is implemented
using interface
4)We cannot achieve multiple inheritance using
abstract class.
5) To implement an interface we use

"Why java is platform independent?
The most unique feature of java is platform independent. In any programming language soruce code is
compiled in to executable code . This cannot be run across all platforms. When javac compiles a java
program it generates an executable file called .class file.
class file contains byte codes. Byte codes are interpreted only by JVMs . Since these JVMs are made
available across all platforms by Sun Microsystems, we can execute this byte code in any platform. Byte
code generated in windows environment can also be executed in linux environment. This makes java
platform independent."
"What is method overloading in java ?
A class having two or more methods with same name but with different arguments then we say that those
methods are overloaded. Static polymorphism is achieved in java using method overloading.
Method overloading is used when we want the methods to perform similar tasks but with different inputs
or values. When an overloaded method is invoked java first checks the method name, and the number of
arguments ,type of arguments; based on this compiler executes this method.
Compiler decides which method to call at compile time. By using overloading static polymorphism or static
binding can be achieved in java.
Note : Return type is not part of method signature. we may have methods with different return types but
return type alone is not sufficient to call a method in java."
"What is difference between c++ and Java ?
Java C++
1) Java is platform independent C++ is platform dependent.

"What is JIT compiler ?
JIT compiler stands for Just in time compiler. JIT compiler compiles byte code in to executable code .
JIT a part of JVM .JIT cannot convert complete java program in to executable code it converts as and
when it is needed during execution."
"What is bytecode in java ?
When a javac compiler compiler compiles a class it generates .class file. This .class file contains set of
instructions called byte code. Byte code is a machine independent language and contains set of
instructions which are to be executed only by JVM. JVM can understand this byte codes."
"Difference between this() and super() in java ?
this() is used to access one constructor from another with in the same class while super() is used to
access superclass constructor. Either this() or super() exists it must be the first statement in the
constructor."
"What is a class ?
Classes are fundamental or basic unit in Object Oriented Programming .A class is kind of blueprint or
template for objects. Class defines variables, methods. A class tells what type of objects we are creating.
For example take Department class tells us we can create department type objects. We can create any
number of department objects.
All programming constructs in java reside in class. When JVM starts running it first looks for the class
when we compile. Every Java application must have atleast one class and one main method.
Class starts with class keyword. A class definition must be saved in class file that has same as class name.
File name must end with .java extension. public class FirstClass
{public static void main(String[] args)
{System.out.println(My First class);
}
} If we see the above class when we compile JVM loads the FirstClass and generates a .class
file(FirstClass.class). When we run the program we are running the class and then executes the main
method."
"What is an object ?
An Object is instance of class. A class defines type of object. Each object belongs to some class.Every
object contains state and behavior. State is determined by value of attributes and behavior is called
method. Objects are alos called as an instance.
To instantiate the class we declare with the class type. public classFirstClass {public static voidmain(String[] args)
{
FirstClass f=new FirstClass();
System.out.println(My First class);
}
} To instantiate the FirstClass we use this statement
FirstClass f=new FirstClass();
f is used to refer FirstClass object."
"What is method in java ?
It contains the executable body that can be applied to the specific object of the class.
Method includes method name, parameters or arguments and return type and a body of executable code. Syntax : type methodName(Argument List){
} ex : public float add(int a, int b, int c)
methods can have multiple arguments. Separate with commas when we have multiple arguments."
"What is encapsulation ? The process of wrapping or putting up of data in to a single unit class and
keeps data safe from misuse is called encapsulation . Through encapsulation we can hide and protect the data stored in java objects.Java supports
encapsulation through access control. There are four access control modifiers in java public , private
,protected and default level.
For example take a car class , In car we have many parts which is not required for driver to know what all
it consists inside. He is required to know only about how to start and stop the car. So we can expose
what all are required and hide the rest by using encapsulation."
"public : public is an access specifier which can be used outside the class. When main method is declared
public it means it can be used outside class.
static : To call a method we require object. Sometimes it may be required to call a method without the
help of object. Then we declare that method as static. JVM calls the main() method without creating
object by declaring keyword static.
void : void return type is used when a method doesnt return any value . main() method doesnt return
any value, so main() is declared as void. Signature : public static void main(String[] args) {"
"Explain about main() method in java ?
Main() method is starting point of execution . String args[] are array of string objects we need to pass from command line arguments.
Every Java application must have atleast one main method.for all java applications. public static void main(String[] args) {} "
"What is constructor in java ?
we use constructors to initialize all variables in the class when an object is created. As and when an object
is created it is initialized automatically with the help of constructor in java.
We have two types of constructors
Default Constructor
Parameterized Constructor
Signature : public classname()
{
}
Signature : public classname(parameters list)
{
}. A constructor is a special method used to initialize objects in java."
"What is difference between length and length() method in java ?
length() : In String class we have length() method which is used to return the number of characters in
string.
Ex : String str = Hello World;
System.out.println(str.length());
Str.length() will return 11 characters including space.
length : we have length instance variable in arrays which will return the number of values or objects in
array.
For example :
String days[]={ Sun,Mon,wed,thu,fri,sat};
Will return 6 since the number of values in days array is 6.
21) What is ASCII Code?
ASCII stands for American Standard code for Information Interchange. ASCII character range is 0 to 255.
We cant add more characters to the ASCII Character set. ASCII character set supports only English. That is the reason, if we see C language we can write c language only in English we cant write in other
languages because it uses ASCII code."
"What is Unicode ?
Unicode is a character set developed by Unicode Consortium. To support all languages in the world Java
supports Unicode values. Unicode characters were represented by 16 bits and its character range is 0-
65,535.
Java uses ASCII code for all input elements except for Strings,identifiers, and comments. If we want to
use telugu we can use telugu characters for identifiers.We can enter comments in telugu."
"Difference between Character Constant and String Constant in java ?
Character constant is enclosed in single quotes. String constants are enclosed in double quotes. Character
constants are single digit or character. String Constants are collection of characters.
Ex :2, A
Ex : Hello World"
"What are constants and how to create constants in java?
Constants are fixed values whose values cannot be changed during the execution of program. We create
constants in java using final keyword.
Ex : final int number =10;
final String str=java-interview questions"
"Difference between >> and >>> operators in java?
>> is a right shift operator shifts all of the bits in a value to the right to a specified number of times.
int a =15;
a= a >> 3;
The above line of code moves 15 three characters right.
>>> is an unsigned shift operator used to shift right. The places which were vacated by shift are filled
with zeroes."
"Explain Java Coding Standards for classes or Java coding conventions for classes?
Sun has created Java Coding standards or Java Coding Conventions . It is recommended highly to follow
java coding standards.
Classnames should start with uppercase letter. Classnames names should be nouns. If Class name is of
multiple words then the first letter of inner word must be capital letter.
Ex : Employee, EmployeeDetails, ArrayList, TreeSet, HashSet"
"Explain Java Coding standards for interfaces?
1) Interface should start with uppercase letters
2) Interfaces names should be adjectives
Example : Runnable, Serializable, Marker, Cloneable"
"Explain Java Coding standards for Methods?
1) Method names should start with small letters.

Ex : string,value,empName,empSalary"
"Explain Java Coding Standards for Constants?
Constants in java are created using static and final keywords.
1) Constants contains only uppercase letters.
2) If constant name is combination of two words it should be separated by underscore. 3) Constant names are usually nouns.
Ex:MAX_VALUE, MIN_VALUE, MAX_PRIORITY, MIN_PRIORITY"
"Difference between overriding and overloading in java?
Overriding Overloading
In overriding method names must be same In overloading method names must be same
Argument List must be same Argument list must be different atleast order of
arguments.
Return type can be same or we can return covariant
type. From 1.5 covariant types are allowed
Return type can be different in overloading.
We cant increase the level of checked exceptions.
No restrictions for unchecked exceptions
In overloading different exceptions can be thrown.
A method can only be overridden in subclass A method can be overloaded in same class or
subclass
Private,static and final variables cannot be
overridden.
Private , static and final variables can be
overloaded.
In overriding which method is called is decided at
runtime based on the type of object referenced at
run time
In overloading which method to call is decided at
compile time based on reference type.
Overriding is also known as Runtime polymorphism,
dynamic polymorphism or late binding
Overloading is also known as Compile time
polymorphism, static polymorphism or early
binding."
"What is IS-A  relationship in java?
is a relationship is also known as inheritance. We can implement is a relationship or inheritance in java
using extends keyword. The advantage or inheritance or is a relationship is reusability of code instead of
duplicating the code.
Ex : Motor cycle is a vehicle
Car is a vehicle Both car and motorcycle extends vehicle."
"What is HAS A relationship in java?
Has a  relationship is also known as composition or Aggregation. As in inheritance we have extends
keyword we dont have any keyword to implement Has a relationship in java. The main advantage of
Has-A relationship in java code reusability"
"Difference between IS-A and HAS-A relationship in java?
IS-A relationship HAS- A RELATIONSHIP
Is a relationship also known as inheritance Has a relationship also known as composition or
aggregation.
For IS-A relationship we uses extends keyword For Has a relationship we use new keyword
Ex : Car is a vehicle. Ex : Car has an engine. We cannot say Car is an
engine
The main advantage of inheritance is reusability of
code
The main advantage of has a relationship is
reusability of code."
"Explain about instanceof operator in java?
Instanceof operator is used to test the object is of which type.
Syntax : <reference expression> instanceof <destination type>
Instanceof returns true if reference expression is subtype of destination type.
Instanceof returns false if reference expression is null.Example : public classInstanceOfExample {public static voidmain(String[] args) {Integer a =
newInteger(5);if (a instanceof java.lang.Integer) {
System.out.println(true);
} else {
System.out.println(false);
} }
}Since a is integer object it returns true.
There will be a compile time check whether reference expression is subtype of destination type. If it is not
a subtype then compile time error will be shown as Incompatible types"
"What does null mean in java?
When a reference variable doesnt point to any value it is assigned null.
Example : Employee employee;
In the above example employee object is not instantiate so it is pointed no where"
"Can we have multiple classes in single file ?
Yes we can have multiple classes in single file but it people rarely do that and not recommended. We can
have multiple classes in File but only one class can be made public. If we try to make two classes in File
public we get following compilation error"
"What all access modifiers are allowed for top class ?
For top level class only two access modifiers are allowed. public and default. If a class is declared as
public it is visible everywhere.
If a class is declared default it is visible only in same package.
If we try to give private and protected as access modifier to class we get the below compilation error."
"What are packages in java?
Package is a mechanism to group related classes ,interfaces and enums in to a single module.
Package can be declared using the following statement :
Syntax : package <package-name>
Coding Convention : package name should be declared in small letters.
package statement defines the namespace.
The main use of package is
1) To resolve naming conflicts
2) For visibility control : We can define classes and interfaces that are not accessible outside the
class."
"Can we have more than one package statement in source file ?
We cant have more than one package statement in source file. In any java program there can be atmost
only 1 package statement. We will get compilation error if we have more than one package statement in
source file."

Identifiers are names in java program. Identifiers can be class name, method name or variable name.
Rules for defining identifiers in java:
1) Identifiers must start with letter,Underscore or dollar($) sign.
2) Identifiers cant start with numbers .
3) There is no limit on number of characters in identifier but not recommended to have more than 15
characters
4) Java identifiers are case sensitive.
5) First letter can be alphabet ,or underscore and dollar sign. From second letter we can have numbers
.
6) We shouldnt use reserve words for identifiers in java."
"What are access modifiers in java?
The important feature of encapsulation is access control. By preventing access control we can misuse of
class, methods and members.A class, method or variable can be accessed is determined by the access modifier. There are three types
of access modifiers in java. public,private,protected. If no access modifier is specified then it has a default
access."
"What is the difference between access specifiers and access modifiers in java?
In C++ we have access specifiers as public,private,protected and default and access modifiers as static,
final. But there is no such divison of access specifiers and access modifiers in java. In Java we have
access modifiers and non access modifiers.
Access Modifiers : public, private, protected, default
Non Access Modifiers : abstract, final, stricfp."
"What access modifiers can be used for class ?
We can use only two access modifiers for class public and default.
public: A class with public modifier can be visible
1) In the same class
2) In the same package subclass
3) In the same package nonsubclass
4) In the different package subclass
5) In the different package non subclass.
default : A class with default modifier can be accesed
1) In the same class
2) In the same package subclass
3) In the same package nonsubclass
4) In the different package subclass
5) In the different package non subclass"
"Explain what access modifiers can be used for methods?
We can use all access modifiers public, private,protected and default for methods.
public : When a method is declared as public it can be accessed
6) In the same class
7) In the same package subclass
8) In the same package nonsubclass
9) In the different package subclass
10) In the different package non subclass.
default : When a method is declared as default, we can access that method in
1) In the same class
2) In the same package subclass
3) In the same package non subclass
We cannot access default access method in
1) Different package subclass
2) Different package non subclass.
protected : When a method is declared as protected it can be accessed
1) With in the same class
2) With in the same package subclass
3) With in the same package non subclass
4) With in different package subclass
It cannot be accessed non subclass in different package.

"What is final access modifier in java?
final access modifier can be used for class, method and variables. The main advantage of final access
modifier is security no one can modify our classes, variables and methods. The main disadvantage of final
access modifier is we cannot implement oops concepts in java. Ex : Inheritance, polymorphism.
final class : A final class cannot be extended or subclassed. We ar e preventing inheritance by marking a
class as final. But we can still access the methods of this class by composition. Ex: String class
final methods: Method overriding is one of the important features in java. But there are situations where
we may not want to use this feature. Then we declared method as final which will print overriding. To
allow a method from being overridden we use final access modifier for methods.
final variables : If a variable is declared as final ,it behaves like a constant . We cannot modify the value
of final variable. Any attempt to modify the final variable results in compilation error. The error is as
follows
final variable cannot be assigned."
"Explain about abstract classes in java?
Sometimes we may come across a situation where we cannot provide implementation to all the methods
in a class. We want to leave the implementation to a class that extends it. In such case we declare a class
as abstract.To make a class abstract we use key word abstract. Any class that contains one or more
abstract methods is declared as abstract. If we dont declare class as abstract which contains abstract
methods we get compile time error. We get the following error.
The type <class-name> must be an abstract class to define abstract methods.
Signature ; abstract class <class-name>
{
}
For example if we take a vehicle class we cannot provide implementation to it because there may be two
wheelers , four wheelers etc. At that moment we make vehicle class abstract. All the common features of
vehicles are declared as abstract methods in vehicle class. Any class which extends vehicle will provide
its method implementation. Its the responsibility of subclass to provide implementation.
The important features of abstract classes are :
1) Abstract classes cannot be instantiated.
2) An abstract classes contains abstract methods, concrete methods or both.
3) Any class which extends abstract class must override all methods of abstract class.
4) An abstract class can contain either 0 or more abstract methods. Though we cannot instantiate abstract classes we can create object references . Through superclass
references we can point to subclass."
"Can we create constructor in abstract class ?
We can create constructor in abstract class , it doesnt give any compilation error. But when we cannot
instantiate class there is no use in creating a constructor for abstract class."
"What are abstract methods in java?
An abstract method is the method which doesnt have any body. Abstract method is declared with
keyword abstract and semicolon in place of method body.
Signature : public abstract void <method name>();
Ex : public abstract void getDetails();
It is the responsibility of subclass to provide implementation to abstract method defined in abstract class."
"What is an exception in java?
In java exception is an object. Exceptions are created when an abnormal situations are arised in our
program. Exceptions can be created by JVM or by our application code. All Exception classes are defined
in java.lang. In otherwords we can say Exception as run time error."
"State some situations where exceptions may arise in java?
1) Accesing an element that does not exist in array.
2) Invalid conversion of number to string and string to number.
(NumberFormatException)
3) Invalid casting of class
(Class cast Exception)
4) Trying to create object for interface or abstract class
(Instantiation Exception)"
"What is Exception handling in java?
Exception handling is a mechanism what to do when some abnormal situation arises in program. When an
exception is raised in program it leads to termination of program when it is not handled properly. The
significance of exception handling comes here in order not to terminate a program abruptly and to
continue with the rest of program normally. This can be done with help of Exception handling."
"he subclass of Throwable class in java. When errors are caused by our program we call that as
Exception, but some times exceptions are caused due to some environment issues such as running out of
memory. In such cases we cant handle the exceptions. Exceptions which cannot be recovered are called
as errors in java.
Ex : Out of memory issues."
"What are advantages of Exception handling in java?
1) Separating normal code from exception handling code to avoid abnormal termination of program.
2) Categorizing in to different types of Exceptions so that rather than handling all exceptions with
Exception root class we can handle with specific exceptions. It is recommended to handle exceptions with
specific Exception instead of handling with Exception root class.
3) Call stack mechanism : If a method throws an exception and it is not handled immediately, then that
exception is propagated or thrown to the caller of that method. This propogation continues till it finds an
appropriate exception handler ,if it finds handler it would be handled otherwise program terminates
abruptly."
"In how many ways we can do exception handling in java?
We can handle exceptions in either of the two ways :
1) By specifying try catch block where we can catch the exception.
2) Declaring a method with throws clause ."
"List out five keywords related to Exception handling ?
1) Try
2) Catch
3) throw
4) throws
5) finally"
"Explain try and catch keywords in java?
In try block we define all exception causing code. In java try and catch forms a unit. A catch block catches
the exception thrown by preceding try block. Catch block cannot catch an exception thrown by another try
block. If there is no exception causing code in our program or exception is not raised in our code jvm
ignores the try catch block.
Syntax :
try
{
}
Catch(Exception e)
{
}"
"Can we have try block without catch block?
Each try block requires atleast one catch block or finally block. A try block without catch or finally will
result in compiler error. We can skip either of catch or finally block but not both."
"Can we have multiple catch block for a try block?
In some cases our code may throw more than one exception. In such case we can specify two or more
catch clauses, each catch handling different type of exception. When an exception is thrown jvm checks
each catch statement in order and the first one which matches the type of exception is execution and
remaining catch blocks are skipped.
Try with multiple catch blocks is highly recommended in java.
If try with multiple catch blocks are present the order of catch blocks is very important and the order
should be from child to parent."
"Explain importance of finally block in java?
Finally block is used for cleaning up of resources such as closing connections, sockets etc. if try block
executes with no exceptions then finally is called after try block without executing catch block. If there is
exception thrown in try block finally block executes immediately after catch block.
If an exception is thrown,finally block will be executed even if the no catch block handles the exception."
"Can we have any code between try and catch blocks?
We shouldnt declare any code between try and catch block. Catch block should immediately start after try
block.
try{
//code
}
System.out.println(one line of code); // illegal
catch(Exception e){
//
}"
"Can we have any code between try and finally blocks?
We shouldnt declare any code between try and finally block. finally block should immediately start after
catch block.If there is no catch block it should immediately start after try block.
try{
//code
}
System.out.println(one line of code); // illegal
finally{
//
}"
"Can we catch more than one exception in single catch block?
From Java 7, we can catch more than one exception with single catch block. This type of handling reduces
the code duplication.
Note : When we catch more than one exception in single catch block , catch parameter is implicity final.
We cannot assign any value to catch parameter.
Ex : catch(ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException || ArithmeticException e)
{ }
In the above example e is final we cannot assign any value or modify e in catch statement."
"What are checked Exceptions?
1) All the subclasses of Throwable class except error,Runtime Exception and its subclasses are checked
exceptions.
2) Checked exception should be thrown with keyword throws or should be provided try catch block, else
the program would not compile. We do get compilation error.
Examples :
1) IOException,
2) SQlException,
3) FileNotFoundException,
4) InvocationTargetException,
5) CloneNotSupportedException
6) ClassNotFoundException
7) InstantiationException"
"What are unchecked exceptions in java?
All subclasses of RuntimeException are called unchecked exceptions. These are unchecked exceptions
because compiler does not checks if a method handles or throws exceptions.
Program compiles even if we do not catch the exception or throws the exception.
If an exception occurs in the program,program terminates . It is difficult to handle these exceptions
because there may be many places causing exceptions.
Example : 1) Arithmetic Exception
3) ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
4) ClassCastException
5) IndexOutOfBoundException
6) NullPointerException
7) NumberFormatException
8) StringIndexOutOfBounds
9) UnsupportedOperationException"
"Explain differences between checked and Unchecked exceptions in java?
Unchecked Exception Checked Exception
1) All the subclasses of RuntimeException are
called unchecked exception.
All subclasses of Throwable class except
RuntimeException are called as checked exceptions
2) Unchecked exceptions need not be handled at
compile time
Checked Exceptions need to be handled at compile
time.
3) These exceptions arise mostly due to coding
mistakes in our program.
4) ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException,
ClassCastException, IndexOutOfBoundException
SqlException,
FileNotFoundException,ClassNotFoundException"
"What is default Exception handling in java?
When JVM detects exception causing code, it constructs a new exception handling object by including the
following information.
1) Name of Exception
2) Description about the Exception
3) Location of Exception.
After creation of object by JVM it checks whether there is exception handling code or not. If there is
exception handling code then exception handles and continues the program. If there is no exception
handling code JVM give the responsibility of exception handling to default handler and terminates
abruptly.
Default Exception handler displays description of exception,prints the stacktrace and location of exception
and terminates the program.
Note : The main disadvantage of this default exception handling is program terminates abruptly."
"Explain throw keyword in java?
Generally JVM throws the exception and we handle the exceptions by using try catch block. But there are
situations where we have to throw userdefined exceptions or runtime exceptions. In such case we use
throw keyword to throw exception explicitly.
Syntax : throw throwableInstance;
Throwable instance must be of type throwable or any of its subclasses.
After the throw statement execution stops and subsequent statements are not executed. Once exception
object is thrown JVM checks is there any catch block to handle the exception. If not then the next catch
statement till it finds the appropriate handler. If appropriate handler is not found ,then default exception
handler halts the program and prints the description and location of exception.
In general we use throw keyword for throwing userdefined or customized exception."
"Can we write any code after throw statement?
After throw statement jvm stop execution and subsequent statements are not executed. If we try to write
any statement after throw we do get compile time error saying unreachable code."
"Explain importance of throws keyword in java?
Throws statement is used at the end of method signature to indicate that an exception of a given type
may be thrown from the method.
The main purpose of throws keyword is to delegate responsibility of exception handling to the caller
methods, in the case of checked exception.
In the case of unchecked exceptions, it is not required to use throws keyword.
We can use throws keyword only for throwable types otherwise compile time error saying incompatible
types.
An error is unchecked , it is not required to handle by try catch or by throws.
Syntax : Class Test{
Public static void main(String args[]) throws IE
{
}
}
Note : The method should throw only checked exceptions and subclasses of checked exceptions.
It is not recommended to specify exception superclasses in the throws class when the actual exceptions
thrown in the method are instances of their subclass."
"Explain the importance of finally over return statement?
finally block is more important than return statement when both are present in a program. For example if
there is any return statement present inside try or catch block , and finally block is also present first
finally statement will be executed and then return statement will be considered."
"Explain a situation where finally block will not be executed?
Finally block will not be executed whenever jvm shutdowns. If we use system.exit(0) in try statement
finally block if present will not be executed."
"Can we use catch statement for checked exceptions?
If there is no chance of raising an exception in our code then we cant declare catch block for handling
checked exceptions .This raises compile time error if we try to handle checked exceptions when there is
no possibility of causing exception."
"What are user defined exceptions?
To create customized error messages we use userdefined exceptions. We can create user defined
exceptions as checked or unchecked exceptions.
We can create user defined exceptions that extend Exception class or subclasses of checked exceptions so
that userdefined exception becomes checked.
Userdefined exceptions can extend RuntimeException to create userdefined unchecked exceptions.
Note : It is recommended to keep our customized exception class as unchecked,i.e we need to extend
Runtime Exception class but not Excpetion class."
"Can we rethrow the same exception from catch handler?
Yes we can rethrow the same exception from our catch handler. If we want to rethrow checked exception
from a catch block we need to declare that exception."
"Can we nested try statements in java?
Yes try statements can be nested. We can declare try statements inside the block of another try
statement."
"Explain the importance of throwable class and its methods?
Throwable class is the root class for Exceptions. All exceptions are derived from this throwable class. The
two main subclasses of Throwable are Exception and Error. The three methods defined in throwable class
are :
1) void printStackTrace() :
This prints the exception information in the following format :
Name of the exception, description followed by stack trace.
2) getMessage()
This method prints only the description of Exception.
3) toString():
It prints the name and description of Exception"
"Explain when ClassNotFoundException will be raised ?
When JVM tries to load a class by its string name, and couldnt able to find the class
classNotFoundException will be thrown. An example for this exception is when class name is misspelled
and when we try to load the class by string name hence class cannot be found which raises
ClassNotFoundException."
"Explain when NoClassDefFoundError will be raised ?
This error is thrown when JVM tries to load the class but no definition for that class is found
NoClassDefFoundError will occur. The class may exist at compile time but unable to find at runtime. This
might be due to misspelled classname at command line, or classpath is not specified properly , or the
class file with byte code is no longer available."
"What is process ?
A process is a program in execution.
Every process have their own memory space.Process are heavy weight and requires their own address
space. One or more threads make a process."
"What is thread in java?
Thread is separate path of execution in program.
Threads are
1) Light weight
2) They share the same address space.
3) creating thread is simple when compared to process because creating thread requires less resources
when compared to process
4) Threads exists in process. A process have atleast one thread."
"Difference between process and thread?
Process Thread
1) Program in execution. Separate path of execution in program. One or
more threads is called as process.
2) Processes are heavy weight Threads are light weight.
3) Processes require separate address space. Threads share same address space.
4) Interprocess communication is expensive. Interthread communication is less expensive
compared to processes.
5) Context switching from one process to another
is costly.
Context switching between threads is low cost."
"What is multitasking ?
Multitasking means performing more than one activity at a time on the computer. Example Using
spreadsheet and using calculator at same time."
"What are different types of multitasking?
There are two different types of multitasking : 1) Process based multitasking
2) Thread based multitasking
Process based multitasking : It allows to run two or more programs concurrently. In process
based multitasking a process is the smallest part of code .
Example : Running Ms word and Ms powerpoint at a time.
Thread based multitasking : It allows to run parts of a program to run concurrently.
Example : Formatting the text and printing word document at same time .
Java supports thread based multitasking and provides built in support for multithreading."
"What are the benefits of multithreaded programming?
Multithreading enables to use idle time of cpu to another thread which results in faster execution of
program. In single threaded environment each task has to be completed before proceeding to next task
making cpu idle."
"Explain thread in java?
1) Thread is independent path of execution with in a program.
2) A thread consists of three parts Virtual Cpu, Code and data.
3) At run time threads share code and data i.e they use same address space.
4) Every thread in java is an object of java.lang.Thread class."
"List Java API that supports threads?
java.lang.Thread : This is one of the way to create a thread. By extending Thread class and overriding
run() we can create thread in java.
java.lang.Runnable : Runnable is an interface in java. By implementing runnable interface and overriding
run() we can create thread in java.
java.lang.Object : Object class is the super class for all the classes in java. In object class we have three
methods wait(), notify(), notifyAll() that supports threads.
java.util.concurrent : This package has classes and interfaces that supports concurrent programming.
Ex : Executor interface, Future task class etc."
"Explain about main thread in java?
Main thread is the first thread that starts immediately after a program is started.
Main thread is important because :
1) All the child threads spawn from main thread.
2) Main method is the last thread to finish execution.
When JVM calls main method() it starts a new thread. Main() method is temporarily stopped while the
new thread starts running."
"In how many ways we can create threads in java?
We can create threads in java by any of the two ways :
1) By extending Thread class
2) By Implementing Runnable interface."
"Explain creating threads by implementing Runnable class?
This is first and foremost way to create threads . By implementing runnable interface and implementing
run() method we can create new thread.
Method signature : public void run()
Run is the starting point for execution for another thread within our program.
Example :
public class MyClass implements Runnable {
@Override
public void run() {
// T
}
}"
"Explain creating threads by extending Thread class ?
We can create a thread by extending Thread class. The class which extends Thread class must override
the run() method.
Example :
public class MyClass extends Thread {
@Override
public void run() { // Starting point of Execution
}
}"
"Which is the best approach for creating thread ?
The best way for creating threads is to implement runnable interface.
When we extend Thread class we cant extend any other class.
When we create thread by implementing runnable interface we can implement Runnable interface. In
both ways we have to implement run() method."
"Explain the importance of thread scheduler in java?
Thread scheduler is part of JVM use to determine which thread to run at this moment when there are
multiple threads. Only threads in runnable state are choosen by scheduler.
Thread scheduler first allocates the processor time to the higher priority threads. To allocate
microprocessor time in between the threads of the same priority, thread scheduler follows round robin
fasion."
"Explain the life cycle of thread?
A thread can be in any of the five states :
1) New : When the instance of thread is created it will be in New state.
Ex : Thread t= new Thread();
In the above example t is in new state. The thread is created but not in active state to make it active we
need to call start() method on it.
2) Runnable state : A thread can be in the runnable state in either of the following two ways :
a) When the start method is invoked or
b) A thread can also be in runnable state after coming back from blocked or sleeping or waiting state.
3) Running state : If thread scheduler allocates cpu time, then the thread will be in running state.
4) Waited /Blocking/Sleeping state:
In this state the thread can be made temporarily inactive for a short period of time. A thread can be in
the above state in any of the following ways:
1) The thread waits to acquire lock of an object.
2) The thread waits for another thread to complete.
3) The thread waits for notification of other thread.
5) Dead State : A thread is in dead state when threads run method execution is complete. It dies
automatically when threads run method execution is completed and the thread object will be garbage
collected."
"Can we restart a dead thread in java?
If we try to restart a dead thread by using start method we will get run time exception since the thread is
not alive."
"Can one thread block the other thread?
No one thread cannot block the other thread in java. It can block the current thread that is running."
"Can we restart a thread already started in java?
A thread can be started in java using start() method in java. If we call start method second time once it is
started it will cause RunTimeException(IllegalThreadStateException). A runnable thread cannot be
restarted."
"What happens if we dont override run method ?
If we dont override run method .Then default implementation of Thread class run() method will be
executed and hence the thread will never be in runnable state."
"Can we overload run() method in java?
We can overload run method but Thread class start method will always cal run method with no
arguments. But the overloaded method will not be called by start method we have to explicitly call this
start() method."
"What is a lock or purpose of locks in java?
Lock also called monitor is used to prevent access to a shared resource by multiple threads.
A lock is associated to shared resource. Whenever a thread wants to access a shared resource if must first
acquire a lock . If already a lock has been acquired by other it cant access that shared resource. At this moment the thread has to wait until another thread releases the lock on shared resource. To lock an
object we use synchronization in java.
A lock protects section of code allowing only one thread to execute at at a time."
"In how many ways we can do synchronization in java?
There are two ways to do synchronization in java:
1) Synchronized methods
2) Synchronized blocks
To do synchronization we use synchronize keyword."
"What are synchronized methods ?
If we want a method of object to be accessed by single thread at a time we declare that method with
synchronized keyword. 
Signature : public synchronized void methodName(){} To execute synchronized method first lock has to be acquired on that object. Once synchronized method
is called lock will be automatically acquired on that method when no other thread has lock on that
method. once lock has been acquired then synchronized method gets executed. Once synchronized
method execution completes automatically lock will be released. The prerequisite to execute a
synchronized method is to acquire lock before method execution. If there is a lock already acquired by
any other thread it waits till the other thread completes."
"When do we use synchronized methods in java?
If multiple threads tries to access a method where method can manipulate the state of object , in such
scenario we can declare a method as synchronized."
"When a thread is executing synchronized methods , then is it possible to execute other
synchronized methods simultaneously by other threads?
No it is not possible to execute synchronized methods by other threads when a thread is inside a
synchronized method."
"When a thread is executing a synchronized method , then is it possible for the same
thread to access other synchronized methods of an object ?
Yes it is possible for thread executing a synchronized method to execute another synchronized method of
an object.
public synchronized void methodName()
{
}
To execute synchronized method first lock has to be acquired on that object. Once synchronized method
is called lock will be automatically acquired on that method when no other thread has lock on that
method. once lock has been acquired then synchronized method gets executed. Once synchronized
method execution completes automatically lock will be released. The prerequisite to execute a
synchronized method is to acquire lock before method execution. If there is a lock already acquired by
any other thread it waits till the other thread completes."
"What are synchronized blocks in java?
Synchronizing few lines of code rather than complete method with the help of synchronized keyword are
called synchronized blocks.
Signature  : Synchronized (object reference){// code}"
"When do we use synchronized blocks and advantages of using synchronized blocks?
If very few lines of code requires synchronization then it is recommended to use synchronized blocks. The
main advantage of synchronized blocks over synchronized methods is it reduces the waiting time of
threads and improves performance of the system."
"What is class level lock ?
Acquiring lock on the class instance rather than object of the class is called class level lock. The difference
between class level lock and object level lock is in class level lock lock is acquired on class .class instance
and in object level lock ,lock is acquired on object of class."
"Can we synchronize static methods in java?
Every class in java has a unique lock associated with it. If a thread wants to execute static synchronize
method it need to acquire first class level lock. When a thread was executing static synchronized method
no other thread can execute static synchronized method of class since lock is acquired on class.
But it can execute the following methods simultaneously :
1) Normal static methods
2) Normal instance methods
3) synchronize instance methods
Signature : synchronized(Classname.class){}"
"Can we use synchronized block for primitives?
Synchronized blocks are applicable only for objects if we try to use synchronized blocks for primitives we
get compile time error."
"mpile time error.
116) What are thread priorities and importance of thread priorities in java?
When there are several threads in waiting, thread priorities determine which thread to run. In java
programming language every thread has a priority. A thread inherits priority of its parent thread. By
default thread has normal priority of 5. Thread scheduler uses thread priorities to decide when each
thread is allowed to run. Thread scheduler runs higher priority threads first."
"Explain different types of thread priorities ?
Every thread in java has priorities in between 1 to 10. By default priority is 5
(Thread.NORM_PRIORITY). The maximum priority would be 10 and minimum would be 1.Thread class
defines the following constants(static final variables) to define properties.
Thread. MIN_PRIORITY = 1;
Thread.NORM_PRIORITY=5;
Thread. MAX_PRIORITY=10;"
"How to change the priority of thread or how to set priority of thread?
Thread class has a set method to set the priority of thread and get method to get the priority of the
thread.
Signature : final void setPriority(int value);
The setPriority() method is a request to jvm to set the priority. JVM may or may not oblige the request.
We can get the priority of current thread by using getPriority() method of Thread class.
final int getPriority()
{
}"
"If two threads have same priority which thread will be executed first ?
We are not guaranteed which thread will be executed first when there are threads with equal priorities in
the pool. It depends on thread scheduler to which thread to execute. The scheduler can do any of the
following things :
1) It can pick any thread from the pool and run it till it completes.
2) It can give equal opportunity for all the threads by time slicing."
"What all methods are used to prevent thread execution ?
There are three methods in Thread class which prevents execution of thread.
1) yield()
2) join()
3) sleep()"
"Explain yield() method in thread class ?
Yield() method makes the current running thread to move in to runnable state from running state giving
chance to remaining threads of equal priority which are in waiting state. yield() makes current thread to
sleep for a specified amount of time.There is no guarantee that moving a current running thread from
runnable to running state. It all depends on thread scheduler it doesnt gurantee anything. Calling yield() method on thread does not have any affect if object has a lock. The thread doesnt lose
any lock if it has acquired a lock earlier.
Signature :
public static native void yield()
{
}"
"Is it possible for yielded thread to get chance for its execution again ?
Yield() causes current thread to sleep for specified amount of time giving opportunity for other threads of
equal priority to execute. Thread scheduler decides whether it get chance for execution again or not. It all
depends on mercy of thread scheduler."
"Explain the importance of join() method in thread class?
A thread can invoke the join() method on other thread to wait for other thread to complete its
execution. Assume we have two threads, t1 and t2 threads . A running thread t1 invokes join() on
thread t2 then t1 thread will wait in to waiting state until t2 completes. Once t2 completes the execution,
t1 will continue.
join() method throws Interrupted Exception so when ever we use join() method we should handle
Interrrupted Exception by throws or by using try catch block.
Signature : public final void join() throws InterruptedException
{
} public final synchronized void join(long millis)
throws InterruptedException
{
} public final synchronized void join(long millis, int nanos)
throws InterruptedException
{
}"
") Explain purpose of sleep() method in java?
sleep() method causes current running thread to sleep for specified amount of time . sleep() method is
the minimum amount of the time the current thread sleeps but not the exact amount of time.
Signature  : public static native void sleep(long millis) throws InterruptedException
{
} public static void sleep(long millis, int nanos)
throws InterruptedException {
}"
"Assume a thread has lock on it, calling sleep() method on that thread will release the
lock?
Calling sleep() method on thread which has lock doesnt affect. Lock will not be released though the
thread sleeps for a specified amount of time."
"Can sleep() method causes another thread to sleep?
No sleep() method causes current thread to sleep not any other thread."
"Explain about interrupt() method of thread class ?
Thread class interrupt() method is used to interrupt current thread or another thread. It doesnot mean
the current thread to stop immediately, it is polite way of telling or requesting to continue your present
work. That is the reason we may not see the impact of interrupt call immediately.
Initially thread has a boolean property(interrupted status) false. So when we call interrupt() method
status would set to true. This causes the current thread to continue its work and does not have impact
immediately.
If a thread is in sleeping or waiting status (i.e thread has executed wait () or sleep() method) thread gets
interrupted it stops what it is doing and throws an interrupted exception. This is reason we need to handle
interrupted exception with throws or try/ catch block."
"Explain about interthread communication and how it takes place in java?
Usually threads are created to perform different unrelated tasks but there may be situations where they
may perform related tasks. Interthread communication in java is done with the help of following three
methods :
1) wait()
2) notify()
3) notifyAll()"
"Explain wait(), notify() and notifyAll() methods of object class ?
wait() : wait() method() makes the thread current thread sleeps and releases the lock until some other
thread acquires the lock and calls notify().
notify() :notify() method wakes up the thread that called wait on the same object.
notfiyAll() :notifyAll() method wakes up all the threads that are called wait() on the same object. The
highest priority threads will run first.
All the above three methods are in object class and are called only in synchronized context.
All the above three methods must handle InterruptedException by using throws clause or by using try
catch clause"
"Explain why wait() , notify() and notifyAll() methods are in Object class rather than in
thread class?
First to know why they are in object class we should know what wait(), notify(), notifyAll() methods do.
wait() , notify(), notifyAll() methods are object level methods they are called on same object.wait(),
notify(), notifyAll() are called on an shared object so to they are kept in object class rather than thread
class."
"Explain IllegalMonitorStateException and when it will be thrown?
IllegalMonitorStateException is thrown when wait(), notify() and notifyAll() are called in non synchronized
context. Wait(), notify(),notifyAll() must always be called in synchronized context other wise we get this
run time exception."
"when wait(), notify(), notifyAll() methods are called does it releases the lock or holds
the acquired lock?
wait(), notify(), notifyAll() methods are always called in synchronized context. When these methods are
called in synchronized context.
So when they enter first in synchronized context thread acquires the lock on current object. When wait(),
notify(), notifyAll() methods are called lock is released on that object."
"Explain which of the following methods releases the lock when yield(),
join(),sleep(),wait(),notify(), notifyAll() methods are executed?
Method Releases lock (Yes or No)
yield() No
sleep() No
join() No
wait() Yes Notify() Yes
notifyAll() Yes"
"What are thread groups?
Thread Groups are group of threads and other thread groups. It is a way of grouping threads so that
actions can be performed on set of threads for easy maintenance and security purposes.
For example we can start and stop all thread groups. We rarely use thread group class. By default all the
threads that are created belong to default thread group of the main thread. Every thread belongs to a
thread group. Threads that belong to a particular thread group cannot modify threads belonging to
another thread group."
"What are thread local variables ?
Thread local variables are variables associated to a particular thread rather than object. We declare
ThreadLocal object as private static variable in a class. Everytime a new thread accesses object by using
getter or setter we are accesing copy of object. Whenever a thread calls get or set method of
ThreadLocal instance a new copy is associated with particular object."
"What are daemon threads in java?
Daemon threads are threads which run in background. These are service threads and works for the
benefit of other threads. Garbage collector is one of the good example for daemon threads.
By default all threads are non daemon. Daemon nature of a thread can be inherited. If parent thread is
daemon , child thread also inherits daemon nature of thread."
"How to make a non daemon thread as daemon?
By default all threads are non daemon. We can make non daemon nature of thread to daemon by using
setDaemon() method. The important point to note here we can call setDaemon() only before start()
method is called on it. If we call setDaemon() after start() method an IllegalThreadStateException will be
thrown."
"Can we make main() thread as daemon?
Main thread is always non daemon. We cannot change the non daemon nature of main thread to daemon."
"What are nested classes in java?
Class declared with in another class is defined as nested class.
There are two types of nested classes in java.
1) Static nested class
2) Non static nested class
A static nested class has static keyword declared before class definition"
"What are inner classes or non static nested classes in java?
Nested classes without any static keyword declaration in class definition are defined as non static nested
classes. Generally non static nested classes are referred as inner classes.
There are three types of inner classes in java :
1) Local inner class
2) Member inner class
3) Anonymous inner class"
"Why to use nested classes in java?
(or)
What is the purpose of nested class in java?
1) Grouping of related classes
Classes which are not reusable can be defined as inner class instead of creating inner class.
For example : We have a submit button upon click of submit button we need to execute some code. This
code is related only to that class and cannot be reused for other class . Instead of creating a new class we
can create inner class
2) To increase encapsulation :
Inner class can access private members of outer class.so by creating getter and setter methods for
private variables , outside world can access these variables. But by creating inner class private variables
can be accesed only by inner class.
3) Code readable and maintainable :
Rather than creating a new class we can create inner class so that it is easy to maintain. 4) Hiding implementation :
Inner class helps us to hide implementation of class."
"Explain about static nested classes in java?
When a static class is defined inside a enclosing class we define that as nested class. Static nested classes
are not inner classes. Static nested classes can be instantiated without instance of outer class.
A static nested doesnot have access to instance variables and non static methods of outer class."
"How to instantiate static nested classes in java?
We can access static members and static methods of outer class without creating any instance of outer
class.
Syntax for instantiating Static nested class :
OuterclassName.StaticNestedClassName ref=new OuterclassName.StaticNestedClassName();"
"Explain about method local inner classes or local inner classes in java?
Nested classes defined inside a method are local inner classes. We can create objects of local inner class
only inside method where class is defined. A local inner classes exist only when method is invoked and
goes out of scope when method returns."
"Explain about features of local inner class?
1) Local inner class does not have any access specifier.
2) We cannot use access modifiers static for local inner class. But we can use abstract and final for local
inner class.
3) We cannot declare static members inside local inner classes.
4) We can create objects of local inner class only inside method where class is defined.
5) Method local inner classes can only access final variables declared inside a method.
6) Method local inner classes can be defined inside loops(for,while) and blocks such as if etc."
"Explain about anonymous inner classes in java?
Inner class defined without any class name is called anonymous inner class. Inner class is declared and
instantiated using new keyword.The main purpose of anonymous inner classes in java are to provide
interface implementation. We use anonymous classes when we need only one instance for a class. We can
use all members of enclosing class and final local variables.
When we compile anonymous inner classes compiler creates two files
1) EnclosingName.class
2) EnclsoingName$1.class"
"Explain restrictions for using anonymous inner classes?
1) An anonymous inner class cannot have any constructor because there is no name for class.
2) An anonymous inner class cannot define static methods, fields or classes.
3) We cannot define an interface anonymously.
4) Anonymous inner class can be instantiated only once."
"Is this valid in java ? can we instantiate interface in java?
Runnable r = new Runnable() {
@Override
public void run() {
}
};
Runnable is an interface.If we see the above code it looks like we are instantiating Runnable interface. But
we are not instantiating interface we are instantiating anonymous inner class which is implementation of
Runnable interface."
"Explain about member inner classes?
Non static class defined with in enclosing class are called member inner class. A member inner class is
defined at member level of class. A member inner class can access the members of outer class including
private members.
Features of member inner classes :
1) A member inner class can be declared abstract or final.
2) A member inner class can extend class or implement interface.
3) An inner class cannot declare static fields or methods.
4) A member inner class can be declared with public, private, protected or default access."
"How to instantiate member inner class?
OuterClassName.InnerclassName inner=new OuterClassReference.new InnerClassName();
We cannot instantiate inner class without outer class reference"
") How to do encapsulation in Java?
Make instance variables private.
Define getter and setter methods to access instance variables ."
"What are reference variables in java?
Variables which are used to access objects in java are called reference variables.
Ex : Employee emp=new Employee();
In the above example emp is reference variable.
Reference variable can be of only one type.
A reference variable can point to any number of objects. But if a reference variable is declared final it
cant point to other objects.
A reference variable can be declared either to a class type or interface type. If a reference variable is
declared with interface type it points to the class that implements the interface."
"Will the compiler creates a default constructor if I have a parameterized constructor in
the class?
No compiler wont create default constructor if there is parameterized constructor in the class. For
example if I have a class with no constructors, then compiler will create default constructor.
For Example : public classCar {} In the above Car class there are no constructors so compiler creates a default constructor. public classCar {Car(String name) {
}
} In this example compiler wont create any default constructor because already there is one constructor in
the Car class."
"Can we have a method name same as class name in java?
Yes we can have method name same as class name it wont throw any compilation error but it shows a
warning message that method name is same as class name."
"Can we override constructors in java?
Only methods can be overridden in java. Constructors cant be inherited in java. So there is no point of
verriding constructors in java."
"Can Static methods access instance variables in java?
No.Instance variables cant be accessed in static methods. When we try to access instance variable in
static method we get compilation error. The error is as follows:Cannot make a static reference to the non static field name"
"How do we access static members in java?
Instance variables and instance methods can be accessed using reference variable . But to access static
variables or static methods we use Class name in java."
"Can we override static methods in java?
Static methods cant be overridden. If we have a static method in superclass and subclass with same
signature then we dont say that as overriding. We call that as"
"Difference between object and reference?
Reference and object are both different. Objects are instances of class that resides in heap memory.
Objects doesnt have any name so to access objects we use references. There is no alternative way to
access objects except through references. Object cannot be assigned to other object and object cannot be passed as an argument to a method.
Reference is a variable which is used to access contents of an object. A reference can be assigned to other
reference ,passed to a method."
"Objects or references which of them gets garbage collected?
Objects get garbage collected not its references."
"How many times finalize method will be invoked ? who invokes finalize() method in java?
Finalize () method will be called only once on object. Before the object gets garbage collected garbage
collector will call finalize() method to free the resources. Finalize() method will be called only when object
is eligible for garbage collection."
"Can we able to pass objects as an arguments in java?
Only references can be passed to a method not an object. We cannot pass the objects to a method. The
largest amount of data that can passed as parameters are long or double."
"Explain wrapper classes in java?
Converting primitives to objects can be done with the help of wrapper classes. Prior to java 1.5 we use
Wrapper classes to convert primitives to objects. From java 1.5 we have a new feature autoboxing which
is used to convert automatically primitives to objects but in wrapper classes programmer has to take care
of converting primitives to objects.
Wrapper classes are immutable in java. Once a value is assigned to it we cannot change the value."
"Explain different types of wrapper classes in java?
For every primitive in java we have corresponding wrapper class. Here are list of wrapper classes
available in java.
Primtive Wrapper Class
boolean Boolean
int Integer
float Float
char Character
byte Byte
long Long
short Short"
"Can we serialize static variables in java?
Static variables cannot be serialized in java."
"What is type conversion in java?
Assigning a value of one type to variable of other type is called type conversion.
Example : int a =10;
long b=a;
There are two types of conversion in java:
1) Widening conversion
2) Narrowing conversion"
"Explain about transient variables in java?
To save the state of an object to persistent state we use serialization. If we want a field or variable in the
object not to be saved, then we declare that variable or field as transient.
Example : public Class Car implements serializable
{
transient int carnumber;
}
"
"Can we serialize static variables in java?
Static variables cannot be serialized in java."
"What is type conversion in java?
Assigning a value of one type to variable of other type is called type conversion.
Example : int a =10;
long b=a;
There are two types of conversion in java:
1) Widening conversion
2) Narrowing conversion"
"Explain about Automatic type conversion in java?
Java automatic type conversion is done if the following conditions are met :
1) When two types are compatible
Ex : int, float
int can be assigned directly to float variable.
2) Destination type is larger than source type.
Ex : int, long Int can be assigned directly to long .Automatic type conversion takes place if int is assigned to long
because long is larger datatype than int.
Widening Conversion comes under Automatic type conversion."
"Explain about narrowing conversion in java?
When destination type is smaller than source type we use narrowing conversion mechanism in java.
Narrowing conversion has to be done manually if destination type is smaller than source type. To do
narrowing conversion we use cast. Cast is nothing but explicit type conversion.
Example : long a;
byte b;
b=(byte)a;
Note : casting to be done only on valid types otherwise classcastexception will be thrown."
") Explain the importance of import keyword in java?
Import keyword is used to import single class or package in to our source file.import statement is
declared after package decalaration. We use wild character (*) to import package.
Note : After compilation the compiled code does not contain import statement it will be replaced with fully
qualified class names."
"171) Explain naming conventions for packages ?
Sun defined standard naming conventions for packages.
1) Package names should be in small letters.
2) Package name starts with reverse company domain name (excluding www) followed by department
and project name and then the name of package.
Example : com.google.sales.employees"
"What is classpath ?
The path where our .class files are saved is referred as classpath.JVM searches for .class files by using the
class path specified. Class path is specified by using CLASSPATH environment variable. CLASSPATH
environment variable can contain more than one value. CLASSPATH variable containing more than one
value is separated by semicolon.
Example to set class path from command prompt :
set CLASSPATH= C:Program FilesJavajdk1.6.0_25bin;.;
only parent directories need to be added to classpath.Java compiler will look for appropriate packages and
classes."
"What is jar ?
Jar stands for java archive file. Jars are created by using Jar.exe tool. Jar files contains .class files, other
resources used in our application and manifest file.Manifest file contains class name with main method.jar
contains compressed .class files. Jvm finds these .class files without uncompressing this jar."
"What is the scope or life time of instance variables ?
When object is instantiated using new operator variables get allocated in the memory.instance variables
remain in memory till the instance gets garbage collected"
"Explain the scope or life time of class variables or static variables?
Static variables do not belong to instances of the class. We can access static fields even before
instantiating the class. Static variable remain in memory till the life time of application."
"Explain scope or life time of local variables in java?
Local variables are variables which are defined inside a method. When the method is created local
variables gets created in stack memory and this variable gets deleted from memory once the method
execution is done."
"Explain about static imports in java?
From Java 5.0 we can import static variables in to source file. Importing static member to source file is
referred as static import. The advantage of static import is we can access static variables without class or
interface name.
Syntax : import static packagename.classname.staticvariablename;
Ex : import static com.abc.Employee.eno;
To import all static variables from a class in to our source file we use *.
import static com.abc.Employee.*"
"Can we define static methods inside interface?
We cant declare static methods inside interface. Only instance methods are permitted in interfaces.only
public and abstract modifiers are permitted for interface methods. If we try to declare static methods
inside interface we get compilation error saying
Illegal modifier for the interface method Classname.methodName(); only public & abstract are
permitted."
"Define interface in java?
Interface is collection of abstract methods and constants. An interface is also defined as pure or 100
percent abstract class.Interfaces are implicitly abstract whether we define abstract access modifier or not.
A class implementing interface overrides all the abstract methods defined in interface. Implements
keyword is used to implement interface."
") What is the purpose of interface?
Interface is a contract . Interface acts like a communication between two objects. When we are defining
interface we are defining a contract what our class should do but not how it does. An interface doesnt
define what a method does. The power of interface lies when different classes that are unrelated can
implement interface. Interfaces are designed to support dynamic method resolution at run time."
"Explain features of interfaces in java?
1) All the methods defined in interfaces are implicitly abstract even though abstract modifier is not
declared.
2) All the methods in interface are public whether they are declared as public or not.
3) variables declared inside interface are by default public, static and final.
4) Interfaces cannot be instantiated.
5) we cannot declare static methods inside interface.
6)  implements keyword is used to implement interface.
7) Unlike class, interface can extend any number of interfaces.
8) We can define a class inside interface and the class acts like inner class to interface.
9) An interface can extend a class and implement an interface
10) Multiple inheritance in java is achieved through interfaces."
") Explain enumeration in java?
Enumeration is a new feature from Java 5.0. Enumeration is set of named constants . We use enum
keyword to declare enumeration. The values defined in enumeration are enum constants.Each enum
constant declared inside a enum class is by default public , static and final.
Example :
package javaexamples;
public enum Days {
SUN,MON,TUE,WED,THU,FRI,SAT;
}
SUN,MON,TUE,WED,THU,FRI,SAT are enum constants."
"Explain restrictions on using enum?
1) Enums cannot extend any other class or enum.
2) We cannot instantiate an enum.
3) We can declare fields and methods in enum class. But these fields and methods should follow the
enum constants otherwise we get compilation error."
"Explain about field hiding in java?
If superclass and subclass have same fields subclass cannot override superclass fields. In this case
subclass fields hides the super class fields. If we want to use super class variables in subclass we use
super keyword to access super class variables."
"Explain about Varargs in java?
Beginning with Java 5 has a new feature Varargs which allows methods to have variable number of
arguments. It simplifies creation of methods when there are more number of arguments. Earlier to java 5
Varargs are handled by creating method with array of arguments.
Ex : public static void main(String[] args)
A variable length argument is specified using ellispses with type in signature. main method with var args
is written as follows:
public static void main(String  args)
If no arguments are passes we get array with size 0.There is no need for null check if no arguments are
passed."
"Explain where variables are created in memory?
When we declare variables variables are created in stack. So when the variable is out of scope those
variables get garbage collected."
"Can we use Switch statement with Strings?
Prior to Java 7 we can use only int values and enum constants in Switch .Starting with Java 7 we can use
strings in Switch statement. If we use strings in switch statement prior to Java 7 we will get compile time
error only int and enum constants are permitted."
") In java how do we copy objects?
In Java we cannot copy two objects but by assigning one reference to other we can copy objects. For
example if we have a reference r1 that point to object .so when we declare r2=r1, we are assigning
reference r1 to r2 so now r2 points to the same object where r1 points. Any changes done by one
reference on an object will reflect to other."
"Explain about procedural programming language or structured programming
language and its features?
In traditional programming language to solve a problem we use set of procedures. Once the procedures or
functions are determined next they concentrate on storing data.
Features :
1) In this top down approach is followed. First procedures were determined and then concentrate on
minute details.
2) Concentrate more on functions and procedure rather than data.
3) In traditional programming language procedures manipulate global data without knowing to other
procedures.
4) Very little concentration on minute details
The main drawback of traditional programming languages works well only for small problems. But not
suitable for larger problems.
Ex : C language, Pascal"
"Explain about object oriented programming and its features?
Java replaced traditional programming language developed in 1970s. In Object oriented programming
everything is made up of object. In this language bottom up approach is followed. Each
object communicates with other as opposed to traditional view.
Features :
1) In this bottom approach is followed. First concentrates on minute details like creating objects then
concentrates on implementation or solving the problem.
2) Concentrate more on data and give less importance for implementation.
3) Objects communicate with each other
The main advantage of object oriented programming language is works well for larger problems."
"List out benefits of object oriented programming language?
1) Easy maintenance
2) Code reusability
3) Code extendability
4) Reliable"
"Differences between traditional programming language and object oriented programming
language?
Traditional Programming language Object Oriented Programming Language
A program is divided in to modules and procedures. A program is divided in to number of objects.
Implementation is done through procedures. Implementation is done through interfaces.
In traditional programming there is no
encapsulation all procedures access data.
In oops encapsulation is done by tightly coupling
data and behaviour together in class.
Suitable for small programs or problems Suitable for large programs and complex problems."
"Explain oops concepts in detail?
Object oriented programming should support these three features :
1) Inheritance
2) Encapsulation 3) Polymorphism"
"194) Explain what is encapsulation?
Encapsulation is the process of wrapping of code and behaviour in a single unit called class and preventing
from misuse is called encapsulation. Encapsulation exposes only part of object which are safe to exposed
and remaining part of object is kept secured.
Encapsulation is supported through access control in java. There are four types of access control
specifiers(public,private, protected, default) in java which supports encapsulation.
For example tv manufacturers exposes only buttons not all the thousands of electronic components which
it is made up of"
"What is inheritance ?
Inheritance is one of the important feature of object oriented language. Inheriting is the process of
acquiring features of others. For example a child acquires the features of their parents.
In java inheritance is the process of inheriting member of existing classes by extending their functionality.
The original class is called base class, parent class or super class. The new class derived from parent is
called child class, sub class, and derived class.
We use extends keyword in java to extend a class in java. All java classes extend java.lang.Object since
object class is the super class for all classes in java.
When we create a new class by using inheritance is-a relationship is formed."
"Explain importance of inheritance in java?
Reusability :The major advantage of inheritance is code reuse. We can avoid duplicating code by using
inheritance. We can place all common state and behaviour in that class , by extending that class we can
Extendability : We can add new functionality to our application without touching the existing code.
For example if we take Ms word we came across number of versions of msword such as word 2003,2007.
Everytime they wont write new code they reuse the existing code and some more features."
"What is polymorphism in java?
Polymorphism is combination of two greek words which mean many forms. In polymorphism actual type
of object involved in method call determines which method to call rather type of reference variable.
59) What is covariant return ?
In java 1.4 and earlier one method can override super class method if both methods have same signature
and return types.
From Java 1.5 , a method can override other method if argument types match exactly though return
types are different.(Return type must be subtype of other method).
Example : Class A
{
A doSomeThing()
{
return new A();
}
}
Example : Class B
{
B doSomeThing()
{
return new B();
}
}
From java 1.5 return type for doSomeThing() in Class B is valid . We get compile time error in 1.4 and
earlier."
"What is collections framework ?
A framework is set of classes and interfaces to build a functionality. Java collections framework provides
set of interfaces and classes for storing and manipulating collections. Collection framework contains
classes and interfaces in java.util package and java.util.concurrent packages.
Advantages or benefits of Collections framework :
1) High performance
2) Using this framework we can create different types of collections 3) We can create our own collection and we can extend a collection.
4) Reduces programming effort.
5) Increases speed and quality : Collections framework provides high performance, implementations of
useful data structures and algorithms."
") What is collection ?
A collection is a container which holds group of objects. Collection provides a way to manage objects
easily. Collections manages group of objects as single unit.
Examples include list of strings, integers etc.
Here are few basic operations we do on collections :
1) Adding objects to collection.
2) Removing or deleting objects from collection.
3) Retrieving object from collection.
4) Iterating collection"
"Difference between collection, Collection and Collections in java?
collection : represent group of objects where objects are stored.
Collection : This is one of the core interface which provides basic functionality for collection.
Collections : Collections contains some utility static methods that operate on collections."
"Explain about Collection interface in java ?
Collection is the fundamental and root interface in Collections framework. Collection extends Iterable
interface and inherits iterator method which returns Iterator object.
Signature :
public interface Collection<E> extends Iterable<E> {
}
Methods in Collection interface :
boolean add(E e); Adds an element to the collection. Returns true if element is added.
boolean remove(Object
o);
Removes an object from collection if that object is present in collection. Return
true if matching object is removed from collection.
boolean
addAll(Collection<?
extends E> c);
Adds all the elements specified in the collection to this collection.Returns true
if all elements are added.
boolean
removeAll(Collection<?>
c);
Removes all the elements from this collection that are specified in other
collection.Returns true if all the elements are removed.
int size(); Returns number of elements in collection.
boolean isEmpty(); Checks whether collection contains elements or not. If no elements are
present it returns false.
boolean contains(Object
o);
Checks whether specified object is in collection or not. Return true if object is
in collection.
Iterator<E> iterator(); Used to iterator over collection. No guarantee on order of elements iterated.
boolean
retainAll(Collection<?>
c);
Removes all the elements which are not in specified collection. Returns only
elements specified in collection removing other elements.
Object[] toArray(); Returns an array of elements in collection."
"List the interfaces which extends collection interface ?
1) List
2) Set
3) Queue
4) Deque ( From Java 6)"
"Explain List interface ?
List interface extends collection interface used to store sequence of elements in collection.
We can even store duplicate elements in list.
We can insert or access elements in list by using index as we do in arrays.
List is an ordered collection.
The main difference between List and non list interface are methods based on position. Some of the operations we can perform on List :
1) Adding an element at specified index.
2) Removing an element at specified index.
3) To get the index of element
List contains some specific methods apart from Collection interface methods."
"Explain methods specific to List interface ?
boolean addAll(int index, Collection<? extends E>
c);
This method inserts all the elements in specified
collection to the list at specified position.
E get(int index); This method returns an element at specified
position in the list.
E set(int index, E element); This method replaces the element at specified
position in the list with the specified element.
void add(int index, E element); This method inserts the specified element with the
index specified.
E remove(int index); This method removes the element at specified
index and returns the element removed.
int indexOf(Object o); indexOf() method returns the index of last
occurrence of specified element. If there is no
element in the list it removes the element.
ListIterator<E> listIterator(); Returns a list iterator of elements in list.
List<E> subList(int fromIndex, int toIndex); This method returns list of elements between
indexes specified."
"List implementations of List Interface ?
1) ArrayList
2) Vector
3) LinkedList"
"Explain about ArrayList ?
ArrayList is an ordered collection which extends AbstractList and implements List interface.
We use ArrayList mainly when we need faster access and fast iteration of elements in list.
We can insert nulls in to arraylist.
Arraylist is nothing but a growable array. public class ArrayList<E> extends AbstractList<E> implements List<E>,
RandomAccess, Cloneable, java.io.Serializable{} From java 1.4 ArrayList implements RandomAccess interface which is a marker interface which supports
fast and random access.
Advantages :
1) Faster and easier access.
2) Used for Random access of elements.
Drawbacks :
1) We cannot insert or delete elements from middle of list."
"Difference between Array and ArrayList ?
Arrays are used to store primitives or objects of same type or variables that are subclasses of same type.
ArrayList : It is an ordered collection which grows dynamically.
In list we can insert nulls values and list allows duplicate elements.
ARRAY ARRAY LIST
1) While creating array we have to know the
size.
1) But it is not required to know size while
creating ArrayList, because arraylist grows
dynamically.
2) To put an element in to array we use the
following syntax :String array[] =
newString[5];array[1] = java;We must know
specific location to insert an element in to
2) We can add element to arraylist with following
syntax :List<String> stringList = new
ArrayList<String>();stringList.add(java); array. If we try to put element in index which is
out of range we get ArrayIndexOutOfBounds
Exception
3) Arrays are static 3) ArrayList is dynamic
4) We can store objects and primitives 4) We can store only primitives prior to 1.5 . From
1.5 we can store even objects also.
5) We have to manually write logic for inserting
and removing elements.
5) Just a method call would add or remove
elements from list.
6) Arrays are faster 6) Arraylist is slower.
7) Arraylist is implemented using arrays."
"What is vector?
Vector is similar to arraylist used for random access.
Vector is a dynamic array like arraylist.
vector size increases or decreases when elements are added and removed .
Vector is synchronized .
vector and Hashtable are the only collections since 1.0.
Rest of the collections are added from 2.0 public class Vector<E>extends AbstractList<E>implements List<E>,
RandomAccess, Cloneable, java.io.Serializable"
"Difference between arraylist and vector ?
Both ArrayList and vector grows dynamically. The differences between arraylist and vector are :
1) Arraylist is not synchronized and vector is synchronized.
2) Vector is legacy collection introduced in 1.0 and Arraylist introduced in java 2.0.
Performance wise it is recommended to use arraylist rather than vector because by default vector is
synchronized which reduces performance if only one thread accesses it."
") Define Linked List and its features with signature ?
Linked list is used for storing a collection of objects that allows efficient addition and removal of elements
in the middle of the collection.
The main drawback with arrays is if we want to insert an element in the middle of the list we need to
move each element to next position and insert the element. Similarly with remove if we want to remove
an element we need to remove the element and move the list of elements.
But with linked list we can insert and delete in the middle of the list efficiently by just updating the
neighbouring node reference.
Linked list class is in java.util package.
Linked List class extends class extends AbstractSequentialList and I mplements List, Deque, Cloneable
and Serializable. Signature :public class LinkedList<E> extends
AbstractSequentialList<E>
implements List<E>, Deque<E>, Cloneable, java.io.Serializable
{
} Important methods specific to LinkedList class :
1) public E getFirst() :
getFirst() will returns the first element in the list.
2) public E getLast() :
getLast() returns the last element in the list.
3) public E removeFirst() :
removeFirst() method removes the first element in the list.
4) public E removeLast() : removeLast() method removes the last element in the list.
5) public void addFirst(E e)
Inserts the element at beginning of the list.
6) public void addLast(E e) :
Inserts the element at end of the list."
"Define Iterator and methods in Iterator?
If we want to iterate through all the elements in collection we use Iterator. Iterator is a standard way to
access elements one by one in collection. Iterator is an object associated with collection used to loop
through the collection.
Steps for accessing elements in Iterator :
1) Obtain Iterator object by calling iterator() method on collection.
Ex : ArrayList <String> al=new ArrayList<String>();
Iterator itr=al.iterator();
2) Call hasNext() method on iterator object in loop as long as hasNext() returns true.
Ex : while(itr.hasNext())
{
}
3) Get each element by calling next() inside the loop.
while(itr.hasNext())
{
String str=itr.next();
}
Methods in iterator :
Method Description
boolean hasNext(); This method returns true if there is next element.hasNext() points to position
before first lement.If there are any elements if will return true.
E next(); Returns the next element in the iteration. . If there are no elements in the
Iteration NoSuchElementException is thrown. next() will move the pointer to
next position and returns the element.
void remove(); Removes the element.
Note : If we call next() on last element it will throw java.util.NoSuchElementException. So before calling
next() first we should call hasNext() whether it has elements or not. If there is next element we can call
next() so that we can avoid exception."
"In which order the Iterator iterates over collection?
The order in which Iterator will iterate the collection depends on the traversal order of collection.
For example : for list traversal order will be sequential, and for set the order cannot be determined, and
for sorted sorted set will sort the elements in sorted order.
So it all depends on the collection in which order iterator iterates."
"Explain ListIterator and methods in ListIterator?
List Iterator is similar to Iterator but ListIterator is bidirectional.
We can traverse through the collection in either forward or backward direction.
List Iterator extends Iterator and all the methods in Iterator will be there in ListIterator too with some
additional methods .
List Iterator doesnt have current element .Position of List Iterator lies between two elements i.e previous
element and next element.
Features of ListIterator :
1) Traversal of List in either direction.
2) Modification of its elements.
3) Access to elements position.
Signature :
public interface ListIterator<E> extends Iterator<E> {
}
ListIterator methods :
Description Method Void add(E obj) Inserts element in to the list infront of the element returned by call to next() and
after the element returned by call to next().
boolean hasNext(); Returns true if there are more elements in the list instead of throwing exception if
there are no elements.
E next(); Returns the next element . NoSuchElementException is thrown if there is no next
element.
boolean Returns true if there are elements when iterating list in reverse direction.
hasPrevious();
E previous(); Returns the previous element in the list.
int nextIndex(); Returns the index of the element returned by next() method. If there are no
elements it returns the size of the list.
int
previousIndex();
Returns the index of the element returned by previous() method. If there are no
elements it returns the size of the list. Returns -1 if the iterator is at beginning of
list.
void remove(); Removes the element that was returned by calling next() or previous(). An Illegal
state Exception will be thrown if remove() is called before next() or previous().
void set(E e); This method replaces an element in the list with the specified element."
"Explain about Sets ?
A set is a collection which does not allow duplicates. Set internally implements equals() method which
doesnt allow duplicates.Adding an duplicate element to a set would be ignored .Set interface is
implemented in java.util.set package.Set interface does not have any additional methods . It has only
collection methods. A set can contain atmost one null value.
ArrayList is an ordered collection.In arraylists order remains same in which they are inserted. But coming
to set it is an unordered collection.
public interface Set<E> extends Collection<E> {
}
Important operations that can be performed on set :
1) Adding an element to set.
2) Removing an element from set.
3) Check if an element exist in set.
4) Iterating through set."
"Implementations of Set interface ?
1) HashSet
2) Linked HashSet
3) TreeSet"
"Explain HashSet and its features ?
Hashset implements set interface and extends AbstractSet. Features of Hashset are :
1) It does not allow duplicates.
2) It does not gurantee ordering of elements.
3) It is unsorted and unordered set.
4) Performance wise it is recommended to use hashset when compared to other sets because it
internally uses hashing mechanism.
5) Allows insertion of nulls.
Note : For efficiency whenever objects are added to HashSet it need to implement the hashCode()
method.
public class HashSet<E> extends AbstractSet<E>
implements Set<E>, Cloneable, java.io.Serializable
{
}"
"Explain Tree Set and its features?
TreeSet implements navigableSet interface and extends Abstract set.It creates collection that uses tree
for storage.
Features of Treeset are :
1) It does not allow duplicates.
2) When we retrieve the elements in treeset we will get elements in sorted order. public class TreeSet<E> extends AbstractSet<E>
implements NavigableSet<E>, Cloneable, java.io.Serializable
{"
"When do we use HashSet over TreeSet?
If we want to search for an element in collection and does not want any sorting order we go for HashSet.
82) When do we use TreeSet over HashSet?
TreeSet is preferred
1) if elements are to be maintained in sorting order.
2) Fast insertion and retrieval of elements."
"dHashSet extends HashSet and implements Set interface.
public class LinkedHashSet<E>
extends HashSet<E>
implements Set<E>, Cloneable, java.io.Serializable {
}
Linked HashSet is similar to HashSet but in linked HashSet we maintain order but in HashSet we dont
maintain order. Maintaining order means elements will be retrieved in order which they are inserted."
"Explain about Map interface in java?
A map is an association of key-value pairs. Both keys and values in map are objects.
Features of map :
1) Maps cannot have duplicate keys but can have duplicate value objects."
"What is linked hashmap and its features?
LinkedHashMap extends HashMap and implements Map.lLinked hashmap gurantees order of elements .
Elements are retrieved in same order they are inserted.Linked HashMap uses internally double linked lists
to keep insertion order.
The differences between Hashmap and linked hashmap is
1) LinkedHashMap maintains the insertion order while HashMap doesnot maintain order.
2) HashMap if faster for insertion and deletion of elements when compared to linked hashmap. Linked
hashmap is preferred only for faster iteration of elements.
public class LinkedHashMap<K,V>
extends HashMap<K,V>
implements Map<K,V>
{
}"
"What is SortedMap interface?
SortedMap extends Map interface.Sorted Map maintains sorted order of keys in a map.
By default sorted map maintains natural ordering if we want custom order we can specify using
comparator.
public interface SortedMap<K,V> extends Map<K,V> {
}"
"What is Hashtable and explain features of Hashtable?
Hashtable was available before collection framework.
When collection framework was started Hashtable extends Dictionary class and Map interface.
Hashtable offers a convenient way of storing key/ value pairs.
Hashtable does not allow nulls either keys or values.
Hashtable is synchronized."
"Difference between HashMap and Hashtable?
Difference HashMap Hashtable
Synronization HashMap is not synchronized. Hashtable is synchronized.
Nulls HashMap allows atmost one null key
and any number of null values.
Hashtable does not allow null values.
Performance Since HashMap is not synchronized its
performance is faster than Hashtable.
Performance is slower when compared to
HashMap.
Introduction HashMap introduced starting from Hashtable is even before collection collection framework. framework."
"Difference between arraylist and linkedlist?
Difference Arraylist LinkedList
Access Implements RandomAccess interface we
can search randomly all the elements
in the list.
It extends Abstract sequential List
interface which provides
sequential access to elements.
Searching and retrieval of
elements
Searching and retrieval of elements is
fast since arraylist provides random
access.
Searching and retrieval of
elements is slow because of
sequential access to elements.
Addition and removal of
elements
Adding and removal of elements in
random positions is slow.For example
if we want to add element to middle of
the list we have to move the elements in
the list and then we need to insert the
element. Similarly for removing the
element we need to follow the same
thing.
Adding and removal of
elements in random positions
is fast because there is no need of
resizing the array just by updating
the node structures with new
addresses."
"Difference between Comparator and Comparable in java?
Sno Comparator Comparable
1. Defined in java.util package Defined in java.lang package.
2. Comparator interface is used when
we want to compare two
different instances
Comparable is used to compare itself with other
instance.
3. Comparator is used when we want
custom sorting.Ex : If we take
employee class sorting by
employeeId is natural sorting.
Comparable is used for natural sorting of objects.Ex :
If we take employee class sorting by ename and age we
can say as custom sorting.
4. Should override int compare(T o1, T
o2) method which takes two
instances.
Should override public int compareTo(T o) method
which takes one instance.
5. For sorting objects we use
collections.sort(list,new
Comparator);
For sorting objects we use collections.sort(list);"
"What is concurrent hashmap and its features ?
Concurrent HashMap is implemented in java.util.concurrent package.
Concurrent HashMap extends Abstract Map and implements concurrent Map.
Concurrent HashMap is used in multi threaded environment.
]It is similar to Hashtable and synchronized version of hashmap but with minor differences.
Concurrent HashMap does not allow null keys and values."
"Difference between Concurrent HashMap and Hashtable and
collections.synchronizedHashMap?
Locking Mechansim :ConcurrentHashMap uses completely different hashing mechanism called lock
striping which offers better concurrency and scalability.
The main advantage of this mechanism is better concurrency instead of synchronizing every method by
using common lock which allows only one thread to access at a time, it allows better concurrency by
allowing multiple threads to access.
ConcurrentModificationException :ConcurrentHashMap provides iterators which doesnot throw concurrent
modification exception which allows only one thread to access iterator, while synchronized map may
throw concurrent modification exception."
") Explain copyOnWriteArrayList and when do we use copyOnWriteArrayList?
copyOnWriteArrayList is used in multithreaded environment. If we want to iterate over arraylist ,but the
arraylist is updated by other threads to prevent concurrent modification exception we have two solutions :
1) First one is we need to synchronize the list manually by using collections.synchronized(list) and
iterate over the list in synchronized block to avoid concurrent modification exception.
2) The second one is to use copyOnWriteArrayList which takes care of concurrency. The advantage of using copyOnWriteArrayList is no need to synchronize list explicitly. So when we use
copyOnWriteArrayList when a thread modifies the list while the other thread was iterating it does not
modify original list but creates a copy of list with modified contents so that the iterator wont know the
modifications made to original list."
"Explain about fail fast iterators in java?
When iterator iterates over collection, collection should not be modified except by that iterator.
Modification means collection cannot be modified by thread when other thread is iterating, if such
modification happens a concurrent modification exception will be thrown.Such kind of iterators are fail fast
iterators.
Ex : ArrayList,HashSet,HashMap. Almost all the iterators implemented in collections framework are fail
fast."
"Explain about fail safe iterators in java?
Fail safe iterators are iterators which does not throw concurrent modification exception, when one thread
modifies collection and other thread in the process of iterating the collection.
It does not throw concurrent modification exception because when other thread was iterating it does not
modify original list but creates a copy of list with modified contents so that the iterator wont know the
modifications made to original list.
Ex : copyOnWriteArrayList"
"What is serialization in java?
Serialization is the process of converting an object in to bytes, so that it can be transmitted over the
network,or stored in a flat file and can be recreated later. Serialized object is an object represented as
sequence of bytes that includes objects data, object type, and the types of data stored in the object."
"What is the main purpose of serialization in java?
The main uses of serialization are :
1) Persistence:
We can write data to a file or database and can be used later by deserializing it.
2) Communication :
To pass an object over network by making remote procedure call.
3) Copying :
We can create duplicates of original object by using byte array.
4) To distribute objects across different JVMs."
"What are alternatives to java serialization?
XML based data transfer
JSON based data transfer.
XML based data transfer : We can use JIBX or JAXB where we can marshall our objects data to xml and
transfer data and then unmarshall and convert to object.
JSON based transfer : We can use json to transfer data."
"Explain about serializable interface in java?
To implement serialization in java there is an interface defined in java.io package called serializable
interface. Java.io.Serializable interface is an marker interface which doesnot contain any any methods. A
class implements Serializable lets the JVM know that the instances of the class can be serialized.
Syntax:
public interface Serializable {
}"
"How to make object serializable in java?
1) Our class must implement serializable interface.If our object contains other objects those class must
also implement serializable interface.
2) We use ObjectOutputStream which extends OutputStream used to write objects to a stream.
3) We use ObjectInputStream which extends InputStream used to read objects from stream."
"What is serial version UID and its importance in java?
Serial version unique identifier is a 64 bit long value .This 64 bit long value is a hash code of the class
name,super interfaces and member. Suid is a unique id no two classes will have same suid. Whenever an
object is serialized suid value will also serialize with it.
When an object is read using ObjectInputStream, the suid is also read. If the loaded class suid does not
match with suid read from object stream, readObject throws an InvalidClassException."
"What happens if we dont define serial version UID ?
If we dont define serial version UID JVM will create one suid for us. But it is recommended to have suid
rather than JVM creating because at run time JVM has to compute the hashcode of all the properties of
class. This process makes serialization low. We cant serialize static fields one exception to this is suid
where suid gets serialized along with the object.
Ex :private static final long serialVersionUID = -5885568094444284875L;"
"Can we serialize static variables in java?
We cant serialize static variables in java. The reason being static variable are class variables that belongs
to a class not to object, but serialization mechanism saves only the object state not the class state."
"When we serialize an object does the serialization mechanism saves its references too?
When we serialize an object even the object it refers must implement serializable then the reference
objects also get serialized. If we dont make reference objects serializable then we get
NotSerializableException."
"If we dont want some of the fields not to serialize How to do that?
If we dont want to serialize some fields during serialization we declare those variables as transient.
During deserialization transient variables are initialized with default values for primitives and null for
object references."
"How will you improve the performance
of a program in Python?
There are many ways to improve the performance of a Python
program. Some of these are as follows:
i. Data Structure: We have to select the right data structure
for our purpose in a Python program.
ii. Standard Library: Wherever possible, we should use
methods from standard library. Methods implemented in
standard library have much better performance than user
implementation.
iii. Abstraction: At times, a lot of abstraction and
indirection can cause slow performance of a program.
We should remove the redundant abstraction in code.
iv. Algorithm: Use of right algorithm can make a big
difference in a program. We have to find and select the
suitable algorithm to solve our problem with high
performance."
"What are the benefits of using Python?
Python is strong that even Google uses it. Some of the benefits of using
Python are as follows:
i. Efficient: Python is very efficient in memory
management. For a large data set like Big Data, it is much
easier to program in Python.
ii. Faster: Though Python code is interpreted, still Python
has very fast performance.
iii. Wide usage: Python is widely used among different
organizations for different projects. Due to this wide
usage, there are thousands of add-ons available for use
with Python.
iv. Easy to learn: Python is quite easy to learn. This is the
biggest benefit of using Python. Complex tasks can be
very easily implemented in Python."
"How will you specify source code
encoding in a Python source file?
By default, every source code file in Python is in UTF-8 encoding. But we
can also specify our own encoding for source files. This can be done by
adding following line after #! line in the source file.
# -*- coding: encoding -*-
In the above line we can replace encoding with the encoding that we want
to use."
"What is the use of PEP 8 in Python?
PEP 8 is a style guide for Python code. This document provides the coding
conventions for writing code in Python. Coding conventions are about
indentation, formatting, tabs, maximum line length, imports organization,
line spacing etc. We use PEP 8 to bring consistency in our code. We
consistency it is easier for other developers to read the code."
"What is Pickling in Python?
Pickling is a process by which a Python object hierarchy can be converted
into a byte stream. The reverse operation of Pickling is Unpickling.
Python has a module named pickle. This module has the implementation of
a powerful algorithm for serialization and de-serialization of Python object
structure.
Some people also call Pickling as Serialization or Marshalling.
With Serialization we can transfer Python objects over the network. It is
also used in persisting the state of a Python object. We can write it to a file
or a database."
"How does memory management work in
Python?
There is a private heap space in Python that contains all the Python objects
and data structures. In CPython there is a memory manager responsible for
managing the heap space.
There are different components in Python memory manager that handle
segmentation, sharing, caching, memory pre-allocation etc.
Python memory manager also takes care of garbage collection by using
Reference counting algorithm."
"How will you perform Static Analysis on
a Python Script?
We can use Static Analysis tool called PyChecker for this purpose.
PyChecker can detect errors in Python code.
PyChecker also gives warnings for any style issues.
Some other tools to find bugs in Python code are pylint and pyflakes."
"What is the difference between a Tuple
and List in Python?
In Python, Tuple and List are built-in data structures.
Some of the differences between Tuple and List are as follows:
I. Syntax: A Tuple is enclosed in parentheses:
E.g. myTuple = (10, 20, apple);
A List is enclosed in brackets:
E.g. myList = [10, 20, 30];
II. Mutable: Tuple is an immutable data structure. Whereas, a List is
a mutable data structure.
III. Size: A Tuple takes much lesser space than a List in Python.
IV. Performance: Tuple is faster than a List in Python. So it gives us
good performance.
V. Use case: Since Tuple is immutable, we can use it in cases like
Dictionary creation. Whereas, a List is preferred in the use case
where data can alter."
"What is a Python Decorator?
A Python Decorator is a mechanism to wrap a Python function and modify
its behavior by adding more functionality to it. We can use @ symbol to call
a Python Decorator function."
"How are arguments passed in a Python
method? By value or by reference?
Every argument in a Python method is an Object. All the variables in
Python have reference to an Object. Therefore arguments in Python method
are passed by Reference.
Since some of the objects passed as reference are mutable, we can change
those objects in a method. But for an Immutable object like String, any
change done within a method is not reflected outside."
"What is the difference between List and
Dictionary data types in Python?
Main differences between List and Dictionary data types in Python are as
follows:
I. Syntax: In a List we store objects in a sequence. In a Dictionary
we store objects in key-value pairs.
II. Reference: In List we access objects by index number. It starts
from 0 index. In a Dictionary we access objects by key specified at
the time of Dictionary creation.
III. Ordering: In a List objects are stored in an ordered sequence. In a
Dictionary objects are not stored in an ordered sequence.
IV. Hashing: In a Dictionary, keys have to be hashable. In a List there
is no need for hashing."
"What are the different built-in data
types available in Python?
Some of the built-in data types available in Python are as follows:
Numeric types: These are the data types used to represent numbers in
Python.
int: It is used for Integers
long: It is used for very large integers of non-limited length.
float: It is used for decimal numbers.
complex: This one is for representing complex numbers
Sequence types: These data types are used to represent sequence of
characters or objects.
str: This is similar to String in Java. It can represent a sequence of
characters.
bytes: This is a sequence of integers in the range of 0-255.
byte array: like bytes, but mutable (see below); only available in Python 3.x
list: This is a sequence of objects.
tuple: This is a sequence of immutable objects.
Sets: These are unordered collections.
set: This is a collection of unique objects.
frozen set: This is a collection of unique immutable objects.
Mappings: This is similar to a Map in Java. dict: This is also called hashmap. It has key value pair to store information
by using hashing."
"What is a Namespace in Python?
A Namespace in Python is a mapping between a name and an object. It is
currently implemented as Python dictionary.
E.g. the set of built-in exception names, the set of built-in names, local
names in a function
At different moments in Python, different Namespaces are created. Each
Namespace in Python can have a different lifetime.
For the list of built-in names, Namespace is created when Python interpreter
starts.
When Python interpreter reads the definition of a module, it creates global
namespace for that module.
When Python interpreter calls a function, it creates local namespace for that
function."
"How will you concatenate multiple
strings together in Python?
We can use following ways to concatenate multiple string together in
Python:
I. use + operator:
E.g.
>>> fname=""John""
>>> lname=""Ray""
>>> print fname+lname
JohnRay
II. use join function:
E.g.
>>> ''.join(['John','Ray'])
'JohnRay'"
"What is the use of Pass statement in
Python?
The use of Pass statement is to do nothing. It is just a placeholder for a
statement that is required for syntax purpose. It does not execute any code
or command.
Some of the use cases for pass statement are as follows:
I. Syntax purpose:
>>> while True:
... pass # Wait till user input is received
II. Minimal Class: It can be used for creating minimal classes:
>>> class MyMinimalClass:
... pass
III. Place-holder for TODO work:
We can also use it as a placeholder for TODO work on a function or code
that needs to be implemented at a later point of time.
>>> def initialization():
... pass # TODO"
"What is the use of Slicing in Python?
We can use Slicing in Python to get a substring from a String.
The syntax of Slicing is very convenient to use.
E.g. In following example we are getting a substring out of the name John.
>>> name=""John""
>>> name[1:3]
'oh'
In Slicing we can give two indices in the String to create a Substring. If we
do not give first index, then it defaults to 0.
E.g.
>>> name=""John""
>>> name[:2]
'Jo'
If we do not give second index, then it defaults to the size of the String.
>>> name=""John""
>>> name[3:]
'n"
"What is the difference between
Docstring in Python and Javadoc in Java?
A Docstring in Python is a string used for adding comments or
summarizing a piece of code in Python.
The main difference between Javadoc and Docstring is that docstring is
available during runtime as well. Whereas, Javadoc is removed from the
Bytecode and it is not present in .class file.
We can even use Docstring comments at run time as an interactive help
manual.
In Python, we have to specify docstring as the first statement of a code
object, just after the def or class statement.
The docstring for a code object can be accessed from the ' doc ' attribute
of that object."
"How do you perform unit testing for
Python code?
We can use the unit testing modules unittest or unittest2 to create and run
unit tests for Python code.
We can even do automation of tests with these modules. Some of the main
components of unittest are as follows:
I. Test fixture: We use test fixture to create preparation methods
required to run a test. It can even perform post-test cleanup.
II. Test case: This is main unit test that we run on a piece of code. We
can use Testcase base class to create new test cases.
III. Test suite: We can aggregate our unit test cases in a Test suite.
IV. Test runner: We use test runner to execute unit tests and produce
reports of the test run."
"What is the difference between an
Iterator and Iterable in Python?
An Iterable is an object that can be iterated by an Iterator.
In Python, Iterator object provides _iter_() and next() methods.
In Python, an Iterable object has _iter_ function that returns an Iterator
object.
When we work on a map or a for loop in Python, we can use next() method
to get an Iterable item from the Iterator."
"What is the use of Generator in
Python?
We can use Generator to create Iterators in Python. A Generator is written
like a regular function. It can make use yield statement to return data during
the function call. In this way we can write complex logic that works as an
Iterator.
A Generator is more compact than an Iterator due to the fact that _iter_()
and next() functions are automatically created in a Generator.
Also within a Generator code, local variables and execution state are saved
between multiple calls. Therefore, there is no need to add extra variables
like self.index etc to keep track of iteration.
Generator also increases the readability of the code written in Python. It is a
very simple implementation of an Iterator."
"What is the significance of functions
that start and end with _ symbol in
Python?
Python provides many built-in functions that are surrounded by _ symbol at
the start and end of the function name. As per Python documentation,
double _ symbol is used for reserved names of functions.
These are also known as System-defined names.
Some of the important functions are:
Object._new_
Object._init_
Object._del_"
"What is the difference between xrange
and range in Python?
In Python, we use range(0,10) to create a list in memory for 10 numbers.
Python provides another function xrange() that is similar to range() but
xrange() returns a sequence object instead of list object. In xrange() all the
values are not stored simultaneously in memory. It is a lazy loading based
function.
But as per Python documentation, the benefit of xrange() over range() is
very minimal in regular scenarios.
As of version 3.1, xrange is deprecated."
"What is lambda expression in Python?
A lambda expression in Python is used for creating an anonymous function.
Wherever we need a function, we can also use a lambda expression.
We have to use lambda keyword for creating a lambda expression. Syntax
of lambda function is as follows:
lambda argumentList: expression
E.g. lambda a,b: a+b
The above mentioned lambda expression takes two arguments and returns
their sum.
We can use lambda expression to return a function.
A lambda expression can be used to pass a function as an argument in
another function."
"How will you copy an object in Python?
In Python we have two options to copy an object. It is similar to cloning an
object in Java.
I. Shallow Copy: To create a shallow copy we call copy.copy(x). In
a shallow copy, Python creates a new compound object based on
the original object. And it tries to put references from the original
object into copy object.
II. Deep Copy: To create a deep copy, we call copy.deepcopy(x). In a
deep copy, Python creates a new object and recursively creates and
inserts copies of the objects from original object into copy object.
In a deep copy, we may face the issue of recursive loop due to
infinite recursion."
"What are the main benefits of using
Python?
Some of the main benefits of using Python are as follows:
I. Easy to learn: Python is simple language. It is easy to learn for a
new programmer.
II. Large library: There is a large library for utilities in Python that
can be used for different kinds of applications.
III. Readability: Python has a variety of statements and expressions
that are quite readable and very explicit in their use. It increases
the readability of overall code.
IV. Memory management: In Python, memory management is built
into the Interpreter. So a developer does not have to spend effort on
managing memory among objects.
V. Complex built-in Data types: Python has built-in Complex data
types like list, set, dict etc. These data types give very good
performance as well as save time in coding new features."
"What is a metaclass in Python?
A metaclass in Python is also known as class of a class. A class defines the
behavior of an instance. A metaclass defines the behavior of a class.
One of the most common metaclass in Python is type. We can subclass type
to create our own metaclass.
We can use metaclass as a class-factory to create different types of classes."
"What is the use of frozenset in Python?
A frozenset is a collection of unique values in Python. In addition to all the
properties of set, a frozenset is immutable and hashable.
Once we have set the values in a frozenset, we cannot change. So we cannot
use and update methods from set on frozenset.
Being hashable, we can use the objects in frozenset as keys in a Dictionary."
"What is Python Flask?
Python Flask is a micro-framework based on Python to develop a web
application.
It is a very simple application framework that has many extensions to build
an enterprise level application.
Flask does not provide a data abstraction layer or form validation by
default. We can use external libraries on top of Flask to perform such tasks."
"What is None in Python?
None is a reserved keyword used in Python for null objects. It is neither a
null value nor a null pointer. It is an actual object in Python. But there is
only one instance of None in a Python environment.
We can use None as a default argument in a function.
During comparison we have to use is operator instead of == for None."
"What is the use of zip() function in
Python?
In Python, we have a built-in function zip() that can be used to aggregate all
the Iterable objects of an Iterator.
We can use it to aggregate Iterable objects from two iterators as well.
E.g.
list_1 = ['a', 'b', 'c']
list_2 = ['1', '2', '3']
for a, b in zip(list_1, list_2):
print a, b
Output:
a1
b2
c3
By using zip() function we can divide our input data from different sources
into fixed number of sets."
"What is the use of // operator in
Python?
Python provides // operator to perform floor division of a number by
another. The result of // operator is a whole number (without decimal part)
quotient that we get by dividing left number with right number.
It can also be used floordiv(a,b).
E.g.
10// 4 = 2
-10//4 = -3"
"What is a Module in Python?
A Module is a script written in Python with import statements, classes,
functions etc. We can use a module in another Python script by importing it
or by giving the complete namespace.
With Modules, we can divide the functionality of our application in smaller
chunks that can be easily managed."
"How can we create a dictionary with
ordered set of keys in Python?
In a normal dictionary in Python, there is no order maintained between
keys. To solve this problem, we can use OrderDict class in Python. This
class is available for use since version 2.7.
It is similar to a dictionary in Python, but it maintains the insertion order of
keys in the dictionary collection."
"Python is an Object Oriented
programming language or a functional
programming language?
Python uses most of the Object Oriented programming concepts. But we
can also do functional programming in Python. As per the opinion of
experts, Python is a multi-paradigm programming language.
We can do functional, procedural, object-oriented and imperative
programming with the help of Python."
"How can we retrieve data from a
MySQL database in a Python script?
To retrieve data from a database we have to make use of the module
available for that database. For MySQL database, we import MySQLdb
module in our Python script.
We have to first connect to a specific database by passing URL, username,
password and the name of database.
Once we establish the connection, we can open a cursor with cursor()
function. On an open cursor, we can run fetch() function to execute queries
and retrieve data from the database tables."
"What is the difference between
append() and extend() functions of a list in
Python?
In Python, we get a built-in sequence called list. We can call standard
functions like append() and extend() on a list.
We call append() method to add an item to the end of a list.
We call extend() method to add another list to the end of a list.
In append() we have to add items one by one. But in extend() multiple items
from another list can be added at the same time."
"How will you handle an error condition
in Python code?
We can implement exception handling to handle error conditions in Python
code. If we are expecting an error condition that we cannot handle, we can
raise an error with appropriate message.
E.g.
>>> if student_score < 0: raise ValueError(Score can not be negative)
If we do not want to stop the program, we can just catch the error condition,
print a message and continue with our program.
E.g. In following code snippet we are catching the error and continuing
with the default value of age.
#!/usr/bin/python
try:
age=18+'duration'
except:
print(""duration has to be a number"")
age=18
print(age)"
"What is the difference between split()
and slicing in Python?
Both split() function and slicing work on a String object. By using split()
function, we can get the list of words from a String.
E.g. 'a b c '.split() returns [a, b, c]
Slicing is a way of getting substring from a String. It returns another String.
E.g. >>> 'a b c'[2:3] returns b"
"How will you check in Python, if a class
is subclass of another class?
Python provides a useful method issubclass(a,b) to check whether class a is
a subclass of b.
E.g. int is not a subclass of long
>>> issubclass(int,long)
False
bool is a subclass of int
>>> issubclass(bool,int)
True"
"How will you debug a piece of code in
Python?
In Python, we can use the debugger pdb for debugging the code. To start
debugging we have to enter following lines on the top of a Python script.
import pdb
pdb.set_trace()
After adding these lines, our code runs in debug mode. Now we can use
commands like breakpoint, step through, step into etc for debugging."
"How do you profile a Python script?
Python provides a profiler called cProfile that can be used for profiling
Python code.
We can call it from our code as well as from the interpreter.
It gives use the number of function calls as well as the total time taken to
run the script.
We can even write the profile results to a file instead of standard out."
"What is the difference between is and
== in Python?
We use is to check an object against its identity.
We use == to check equality of two objects.
E.g.
>>> lst = [10,20, 20]
>>> lst == lst[:]
True
>>> lst is lst[:]
False"
"How will you share variables across
modules in Python?
We can create a common module with variables that we want to share.
This common module can be imported in all the modules in which we want
to share the variables.
In this way, all the shared variables will be in one module and available for
sharing with any new module as well."
"How can we do Functional
programming in Python?
In Functional Programming, we decompose a program into functions. These
functions take input and after processing give an output. The function does
not maintain any state.
Python provides built-in functions that can be used for Functional
programming. Some of these functions are:
I. Map()
II. reduce()
III. filter()
Event iterators and generators can be used for Functional programming in
Python."
"What is the improvement in
enumerate() function of Python?
In Python, enumerate() function is an improvement over regular iteration.
The enumerate() function returns an iterator that gives (0, item[0]).
E.g.
>>> thelist=['a','b']
>>> for i,j in enumerate(thelist):
... print i,j
...
0 a
1 b"
"How will you execute a Python script in
Unix?
To execute a Python script in Unix, we need to have Python executor in
Unix environment.
In addition to that we have to add following line as the first line in a Python
script file.
#!/usr/local/bin/python
This will tell Unix to use Python interpreter to execute the script."
"What are the popular Python libraries
used in Data analysis?
Some of the popular libraries of Python used for Data analysis are:
I. Pandas: Powerful Python Data Analysis Toolkit
II. SciKit: This is a machine learning library in Python.
III. Seaborn: This is a statistical data visualization library in Python.
IV. SciPy: This is an open source system for science, mathematics and
engineering implemented in Python."
"What is the output of following code in
Python?
>>> thelist=['a','b']
>>> print thelist[3:]
Ans: The output of this code is following:
[]
Even though the list has only 2 elements, the call to thelist with index 3
does not give any index error."
"What is the output of following code in
Python?
>>>name=John Smith
>>>print name[:5] + name[5:]
Ans: Output of this will be
John Smith
This is an example of Slicing. Since we are slicing at the same index, the
first name[:5] gives the substring name upto 5th location excluding 5th
location. The name[5:] gives the rest of the substring of name from the 5
th
location. So we get the full name as output."
"If you have data with name of
customers and their location, which data
type will you use to store it in Python?
In Python, we can use dict data type to store key value pairs. In this
example, customer name can be the key and their location can be the value
in a dict data type.
Dictionary is an efficient way to store data that can be looked up based on a
key."
"What is the difference between Stored Procedure and Function?
1. A procedure can have both input and output parameters, but a function can only 
have input parameters. 
2. Inside a procedure we can use DML (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) statements. But 
inside a function we can't use DML statements. 
3. We can't utilize a Stored Procedure in a Select statement. But we can use a function 
in a Select statement. 
4. We can use a Try-Catch Block in a Stored Procedure but inside a function we can't 
use a Try-Catch block. 
5. We can use transaction management in a procedure but we can't in a function. 
6. We can't join a Stored Procedure but we can join functions. 
7. Stored Procedures cannot be used in the SQL statements anywhere in the 
WHERE/HAVING/SELECT section. But we can use a function anywhere. 
8. A procedure can return 0 or n values (max 1024). But a function can return only 1 
value that is mandatory. 
9. A procedure can't be called from a function but we can call a function from a 
procedure."
"What is difference between Clustered Index and Non Clustered Index?
1. A Clustered Index physically stores the data of the table in the order of the keys 
values and the data is resorted every time whenever a new value is inserted or a 
value is updated in the column on which it is defined, whereas a non-clustered index 
creates a separate list of key values (or creates a table of pointers) that points 
towards the location of the data in the data pages. 
2. A Clustered Index requires no separate storage than the table storage. It forces the 
rows to be stored sorted on the index key whereas a non-clustered index requires 
separate storage than the table storage to store the index information. 
3. A table with a Clustered Index is called a Clustered Table. Its rows are stored in a B Tree structure sorted whereas a table without any clustered indexes is called a non clustered table. Its rows are stored in a heap structure unsorted. 
4. The default index is created as part of the primary key column as a Clustered Index. 
5. In a Clustered Index, the leaf node contains the actual data whereas in a non clustered index, the leaf node contains the pointer to the data rows of the table. 
6. A Clustered Index always has an Index Id of 1 whereas non-clustered indexes have 
Index Ids > 1. 
7. A Table can have only 1 Clustered Index whereas prior to SQL Server 2008 only 249 
non-clustered indexes can be created. With SQL Server 2008 and above 999 non clustered indexes can be created. 
8. A Primary Key constraint creates a Clustered Index by default whereas A Unique 
Key constraint creates a non-clustered index by default."
"What is the difference between the DELETE and TRUNCATE commands?
1. The DELETE command is used to remove rows from a table based on a WHERE 
condition whereas TRUNCATE removes all rows from a table. 
2. So we can use a where clause with DELETE to filter and delete specific records 
whereas we cannot use a Where clause with TRUNCATE. 
3. DELETE is executed using a row lock, each row in the table is locked for deletion 
whereas TRUNCATE is executed using a table lock and the entire table is locked for 
removal of all records. 
4. DELETE is a DML command whereas TRUNCATE is a DDL command. 
5. DELETE retains the identity of the column value whereas in TRUNCATE, the Identify 
column is reset to its seed value if the table contains any identity column. 
6. To use Delete you need DELETE permission on the table whereas to use Truncate on 
a table you need at least ALTER permission on the table. 
7. DELETE uses more transaction space than the TRUNCATE statement whereas 
Truncate uses less transaction space than DELETE statement. 
8. DELETE can be used with indexed views whereas TRUNCATE cannot be used with 
indexed views. 
9. The DELETE statement removes rows one at a time and records an entry in the 
transaction log for each deleted row whereas TRUNCATE TABLE removes the data 
by deallocating the data pages used to store the table data and records only the page 
deallocations in the transaction log. 
10. Delete activates a trigger because the operation is logged individually whereas 
TRUNCATE TABLE can't activate a trigger because the operation does not log 
individual row deletions."
".What is the difference between the WHERE clause and the HAVING clause?
1. WHERE clause can be used with a Select, Update and Delete Statement Clause but 
the HAVING clause can be used only with a Select statement. 
2. We can't use an aggregate functions in the WHERE clause unless it is in a sub-query 
contained in a HAVING clause whereas we can use an aggregate function in the 
HAVING clause. We can use a column name in the HAVING clause but the column 
must be contained in the group by clause. 
3. WHERE is used before the GROUP BY clause whereas a HAVING clause is used to 
impose a condition on the GROUP Function and is used after the GROUP BY clause in 
the query. 
4. A WHERE clause applies to each and every row whereas a HAVING clause applies to 
summarized rows (summarized with GROUP BY). 
5. In the WHERE clause the data that is fetched from memory depending on a 
condition whereas in HAVING the completed data is first fetched and then separated 
depending on the condition."
"What is the difference between Primary Key and Unique Key?
1. We can have only one Primary Key in a table whereas we can have more than one 
Unique Key in a table. 
2. The Primary Key cannot have a NULL value whereas a Unique Key may have only 
one null value. 
3. By default, a Primary Key is a Clustered Index whereas by default, a Unique Key is a 
unique non-clustered index. 
4. A Primary Key supports an Auto Increment value whereas a Unique Key doesn't 
support an Auto Increment value."
"What is the difference between a Local Temporary Table and Global Temporary 
Table?
1. A Local Temporary Table is created by giving it a prefix of # whereas a Global 
Temporary Table is created by giving it a prefix of ##. 
2. A Local Temporary Table cannot be shared among multiple users whereas a Global 
Temporary Table can be shared among multiple users. 
3. A Local Temporary Table is only available to the current DB connection for the 
current user and are cleared when the connection is closed whereas a Global 
Temporary Table is available to any connection once created. They are cleared when 
the last connection is closed."
"What are super, primary, candidate and foreign keys?
Ans: A super key is a set of attributes of a relation schema upon which all attributes of the 
schema are functionally dependent. No two rows can have the same value of super key 
attributes.
A Candidate key is minimal super key, i.e., no proper subset of Candidate key attributes 
can be a super key.
A Primary Key is one of the candidate keys. One of the candidate keys is selected as most 
important and becomes the primary key. There cannot be more that one primary keys in a 
table.
Foreign key is a field (or collection of fields) in one table that uniquely identifies a row of 
another table"
"What is the difference between primary key and unique constraints?
Ans: Primary key cannot have NULL value, the unique constraints can have NULL values. 
There is only one primary key in a table, but there can be multiple unique constrains."
"What is database normalization?
Ans: It is a process of analyzing the given relation schemas based on their functional 
dependencies and primary keys to achieve the following desirable properties:
1)Minimizing Redundancy
2) Minimizing the Insertion, Deletion, And Update Anomalies
Relation schemas that do not meet the properties are decomposed into smaller relation 
schemas that could meet desirable properties."
"What is SQL?
SQL is Structured Query Language designed for inserting and modifying in a relational 
database management system."
"What are the differences between DDL, DML and DCL in SQL?
Ans: Following are some details of three.
DDL stands for Data Definition Language. SQL queries like CREATE, ALTER, DROP and 
RENAME come under this.
DML stands for Data Manipulation Language. SQL queries like SELECT, INSERT and 
UPDATE come under this.
DCL stands for Data Control Language. SQL queries like GRANT and REVOKE come under 
this."
"What is the difference between having and where clause?
Ans: HAVING is used to specify a condition for a group or an aggregate function used in 
select statement. The WHERE clause selects before grouping. The HAVING clause selects 
rows after grouping. Unlike HAVING clause, the WHERE clause cannot contain aggregate 
functions."
"What is Join? 
Ans: An SQL Join is used to combine data from two or more tables, based on a common 
field between them. For example, consider the following two tables.
Student Table
EnrollNo StudentName Address
1000 geek1 geeksquiz1
1001 geek2 geeksquiz2
1002 geek3 geeksquiz3
StudentCourse Table CourseID EnrollNo
1 1000
2 1000
3 1000
1 1002
2 1003
Following is join query that shows names of students enrolled in different courseIDs.
SELECT StudentCourse.CourseID, Student.StudentName
 FROM StudentCourse
 INNER JOIN Customers 
 ON StudentCourse.EnrollNo = Student.EnrollNo
 ORDER BY StudentCourse.CourseID;
The above query would produce following result.
CourseID StudentName
1 geek1
1 geek2
2 geek1
2 geek3
3 geek1"
"What is Identity?
Ans: Identity (or AutoNumber) is a column that automatically generates numeric values. A 
start and increment value can be set, but most DBA leave these at 1. A GUID column also 
generates numbers; the value of this cannot be controlled. Identity/GUID columns do not 
need to be indexed."
"What is a view in SQL? How to create one
Ans: A view is a virtual table based on the result-set of an SQL statement. We can create 
using create view syntax.
CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition"
"What are the uses of view?
1. Views can represent a subset of the data contained in a table; consequently, a view can 
limit the degree of exposure of the underlying tables to the outer world: a given user may 
have permission to query the view, while denied access to the rest of the base table. 2. Views can join and simplify multiple tables into a single virtual table
3. Views can act as aggregated tables, where the database engine aggregates data (sum, 
average etc.) and presents the calculated results as part of the data
4. Views can hide the complexity of data; for example a view could appear as Sales2000 or 
Sales2001, transparently partitioning the actual underlying table.
5. Depending on the SQL engine used, views can provide extra security."
"What is a Trigger?
Ans: A Trigger is a code that associated with insert, update or delete operations. The code 
is executed automatically whenever the associated query is executed on a table. Triggers 
can be useful to maintain integrity in database."
"What is a stored procedure?
Ans: A stored procedure is like a function that contains a set of operations compiled 
together. It contains a set of operations that are commonly used in an application to do 
some common database tasks."
"What is the difference between Trigger and Stored Procedure?
Ans: Unlike Stored Procedures, Triggers cannot be called directly. They can only be 
associated with queries."
"What is a transaction? What are ACID properties?
Ans: A Database Transaction is a set of database operations that must be treated as whole, 
means either all operations are executed or none of them.
An example can be bank transaction from one account to another account. Either both debit 
and credit operations must be executed or none of them.
ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) is a set of properties that guarantee 
that database transactions are processed reliably"
"What are indexes? 
Ans: A database index is a data structure that improves the speed of data retrieval 
operations on a database table at the cost of additional writes and the use of more storage 
space to maintain the extra copy of data.
Data can be stored only in one order on disk. To support faster access according to 
different values, faster search like binary search for different values is desired, For this 
purpose, indexes are created on tables. These indexes need extra space on disk, but they 
allow faster search according to different frequently searched values."
"What are clustered and non-clustered Indexes?
Ans: Clustered indexes is the index according to which data is physically stored on disk. 
Therefore, only one clustered index can be created on a given database table.
Non-clustered indexes dont define physical ordering of data, but logical ordering. 
Typically, a tree is created whose leaf point to disk records. B-Tree or B+ tree are used for 
this purpose."
"What are Primary Keys and Foreign Keys?
Ans: Primary keys are the unique identifiers for each row. They must contain unique values 
and cannot be null. Due to their importance in relational databases, Primary keys are the 
most fundamental aspect of all keys and constraints. A table can have only one primary key.
Foreign keys are a method of ensuring data integrity and manifestation of the relationship 
between tables."
"What is SQL ?
Ans: Structured Query Language(SQL) is a language designed specifically for 
communicating with databases. SQL is an ANSI (American National Standards Institute) 
standard ."
"What are the different type of SQL or different commands in SQL?
Ans: Frequently asked SQL Interview Questions
1.DDL  Data Definition Language.DDL is used to define the structure that holds the data. 
2.DML Data Manipulation Language
DML is used for manipulation of the data itself. Typical operations are Insert, Delete,Update 
and retrieving the data from the table 
3.DCLDataControlLanguage 
DCL is used to control the visibility of data like granting database access and set privileges 
to create table etc.
4.TCL-TransactionControl Language

"What are the Advantages of SQL?
1. SQL is not a proprietary language used by specific database vendors. Almost every 
major DBMS supports SQL, so learning this one language will enable programmer to 
interact with any database like ORACLE, SQL ,MYSQL etc.
2. SQL is easy to learn. The statements are all made up of descriptive English words, and 
there aren't that many of them.
3. SQL is actually a very powerful language and by using its language elements you can 
perform very complex and sophisticated database operations."
"what is a field in a database ?
A field is an area within a record reserved for a specific piece of data. 
Examples: Employee Name , Employee ID etc"
"What is a Record in a database ?
A record is the collection of values / fields of a specific entity: i.e. a Employee , Salary etc."
"What is a Table in a database ?
A table is a collection of records of a specific type. For example, employee table , salary 
table etc."
"What is a database transaction?
Database transaction take database from one consistent state to another. At the end of the 
transaction the system must be in the prior state if transaction fails or the status of the 
system should reflect the successful completion if the transaction goes through."
"What are properties of a transaction?
Properties of the transaction can be summarized as ACID Properties. 
1. Atomicity
A transaction consists of many steps. When all the steps in a transaction gets completed, it 
will get reflected in DB or if any step fails, all the transactions are rolled back.
2. Consistency
The database will move from one consistent state to another, if the transaction succeeds 
and remain in the original state, if the transaction fails.
3. Isolation
Every transaction should operate as if it is the only transaction in the system
4. Durability
Once a transaction has completed successfully, the updated rows/records must be 
available for all other transactions on a permanent basis"
"What is a Database Lock ?
Database lock tell a transaction, if the data item in questions is currently being used by 
other transactions."
"What are the type of locks ?
1. Shared Lock
When a shared lock is applied on data item, other transactions can only read the item, but 
can't write into it.
2. Exclusive Lock
When a exclusive lock is applied on data item, other transactions can't read or write into 
the data item"
"What are the different type of normalization?
Frequently asked SQL Interview Questions
In database design , we start with one single table, with all possible columns. Lot of 
redundant data would be present since its a single table. The process of removing the 
redundant data, by splitting up the table in a well defined fashion is called 
normalization.
1. First Normal Form (1NF)
A relation is said to be in first normal form if and only if all underlying domains contain 
atomic values only. After 1NF, we can still have redundant data
2. Second Normal Form (2NF)
A relation is said to be in 2NF if and only if it is in 1NF and every non key attribute is fully 
dependent on the primary key. After 2NF, we can still have redundant data
3. Third Normal Form (3NF)
A relation is said to be in 3NF, if and only if it is in 2NF and every non key attribute is non transitively dependent on the primary key"
"What is a primary key?
Frequently asked SQL Interview Questions
A primary key is a column whose values uniquely identify every row in a table. Primary 
key values can never be reused. If a row is deleted from the table, its primary key may not 
be assigned to any new rows in the future. To define a field as primary key, following 
conditions had to be met :
1. No two rows can have the same primary key value.
2. Every row must have a primary key value
3. Primary key field cannot be null
4. Values in primary key columns can never be modified or updated"
"What is a Composite Key ?
A Composite primary key is a type of candidate key, which represents a set of columns 
whose values uniquely identify every row in a table.
For example - if ""Employee_ID"" and ""Employee Name"" in a table is combined to uniquely 
identifies a row its called a Composite Key"
"What is a Composite Primary Key ?
A Composite primary key is a set of columns whose values uniquely identify every row in a 
table. What it means is that, table which contains composite primary key will be indexed 
based on columns specified in the primary key. This key will be referred in Foreign Key 
tables.
For example - if combined effect of columns, ""Employee_ID"" and ""Employee Name"" in a 
table is required to uniquely identifies a row, its called a Composite Primary Key. In this 
case, both the columns will be represented as primary key"
"What is a Foreign Key ?
Frequently asked SQL Interview Questions
When a ""one"" table's primary key field is added to a related ""many"" table in order to create 
the common field which relates the two tables, it is called a foreign key in the ""many"" table.
For example, salary of an employee is stored in salary table. Relation is established via 
foreign key column Employee_ID_Ref which refers Employee_ID field in Employee table"
"What is a Unique Key ?
Unique key is same as primary with difference being existence of null. Unique key field 
allows one value as NULL value."
"Define SQL Insert Statement ?
SQL INSERT statement is used to add rows to a table. For a full row insert , SQL Query 
should start with insert into  statement followed by table name and values command, 
followed by the values that need to be inserted into the table. Insert can be used in several 
ways:
1. To insert a single complete row
2. To insert a single partial row"
"Define SQL Update Statement ?
SQL Update is used to update data in a row or set of rows specified in the filter condition.
The basic format of an SQL UPDATE statement is ,Update command followed by table to be 
updated and SET command followed by column names and their new values followed by 
filter condition that determines which rows should be updated"
"Define SQL Delete Statement ?
SQL Delete is used to delete a row or set of rows specified in the filter condition.
The basic format of an SQL DELETE statement is, DELETE FROM command followed by 
table name followed by filter condition that determines which rows should be updated."
"What are wild cards used in database for Pattern Matching ?
SQL Like operator is user for pattern matching. SQL 'Like' command takes more time to 
process. So before using like operator, consider suggestions given below on when and 
where to use wild card search.
1) Don't overuse wild cards. If another search operator will do, use it instead.
2) When you do use wild cards, try not to use them at the beginning of the search pattern, 
unless absolutely necessary. Search patterns that begin with wild cards are the slowest to 
process.
3) Pay careful attention to the placement of the wild card symbols. If they are misplaced, 
you might not return the data you intended"
". Define Join and explain different type of joins?
In order to avoid data duplication, data is stored in related tables . Join keyword is used to 
fetch data from related table. Join return rows when there is at least one match in both 
tables . Type of joins are
Right Join 
Return all rows from the right table, even if there are no matches in the left table .
Outer Join
Left Join
Return all rows from the left table, even if there are no matches in the right table .
Full Join
Return rows when there is a match in one of the tables ."
"What is Self-Join?
Self-join is query used to join a table to itself. Aliases should be used for the same table 
comparison."
"What is Cross Join?
Cross Join will return all records where each row from the first table is combined with each 
row from the second table."
"What is a view?
Views are virtual tables. Unlike tables that contain data, views simply contain queries that 
dynamically retrieve data when used."
"What is a materialized view?
Materialized views is also a view but are disk based. Materialized views get updated on 
specific duration, base upon the interval specified in the query definition. We can index 
materialized view."
"What are the advantages and disadvantages of views in a database?
Advantages:
1. Views doesn't store data in a physical location.
2. View can be use to hide some of the columns from the table
3. Views can provide Access Restriction, since data insertion, update and deletion is not 
possible on the view.
Disadvantages:
1. When a table is dropped, associated view become irrelevant.
2. Since view are created when a query requesting data from view is triggered, its bit slow
3. When views are created for large tables, it occupy more memory ."
"What is a stored procedure?
Stored Procedure is a function which contain collection of SQL Queries. Procedure can take 
inputs , process them and send back output."
"What are the advantages a stored procedure?
Stored Procedures are pre-complied and stored in database. This enable the database to 
execute the queries much faster. Since many queries can be included in a stored procedure, 
round trip time to execute multiple queries from source code to database and back is 
avoided."
"What is a trigger?
Database are set of commands that get executed when an event(Before Insert, After Insert, 
On Update, On delete of a row) occurs on a table, views."
"Explain the difference between DELETE , TRUNCATE and DROP commands?
Once delete operation is performed, Commit and Rollback can be performed to retrieve 
data.
Once truncate statement is executed, Commit and Rollback statement cant be performed. 
Where condition can be used along with delete statement but it cant be used with truncate 
statement.
Drop command is used to drop the table or keys like primary,foreign from a table."
"What is the difference between Cluster and Non cluster Index?
A clustered index reorders the way records in the table are physically stored. There can 
be only one clustered index per table. It make data retrieval faster.
A non clustered index does not alter the way it was stored but creates a complete 
separate object within the table. As a result insert and update command will be faster"
"What is Union, minus and Interact commands?
MINUS operator is used to return rows from the first query but not from the second query. 
INTERSECT operator is used to return rows returned by both the queries."
"What's the difference between a primary key and a unique key?
Both primary key and unique enforce uniqueness of the column on which they are defined. 
But by default primary key creates a clustered index on the column, where are unique 
creates a non clustered index by default. Another major difference is that, primary key 
doesn't allow NULLs, but unique key allows one NULL only"
"What are user defined datatypes and when you should go for them?
User defined datatypes let you extend the base SQL Server datatypes by providing a 
descriptive name, and format to the database. Take for example, in your database, there is a 
column called Flight_Num which appears in many tables. In all these tables it should be 
varchar(8). In this case you could create a user defined datatype called Flight_num_type of 
varchar(8) and use it across all your tables."
"How do you implement one-to-one, one-to-many and many-to-many relationships 
while designing tables?
One-to-One relationship can be implemented as a single table and rarely as two tables with 
primary and foreign key relationships.
One-to-Many relationships are implemented by splitting the data into two tables with 
primary key and foreign key relationships.
Many-to-Many relationships are implemented using a junction table with the keys from 
both the tables forming the composite primary key of the junction table."
"What is bit datatype and what's the information that can be stored inside a bit 
column?
Bit datatype is used to store boolean information like 1 or 0 (true or false). Until SQL Server 
6.5 bit datatype could hold either a 1 or 0 and there was no support for NULL. But from SQL 
Server 7.0 onwards, bit datatype can represent a third state, which is NULL."
"Define candidate key, alternate key, composite key
A candidate key is one that can identify each row of a table uniquely. Generally a candidate 
key becomes the primary key of the table. If the table has more than one candidate key, one 
of them will become the primary key, and the rest are called alternate keys.
A key formed by combining at least two or more columns is called composite key."
"What are defaults? Is there a column to which a default can't be bound?
A default is a value that will be used by a column, if no value is supplied to that column 
while inserting data. IDENTITY columns and timestamp columns can't have defaults bound 
to them. See CREATE DEFUALT in books online."
"What is a transaction and what are ACID properties?
A transaction is a logical unit of work in which, all the steps must be performed or none. 
ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability. These are the properties of a 
transaction. For more information and explanation of these properties, see SQL Server 
books online or any RDBMS fundamentals text book."
"Explain different isolation levels
An isolation level determines the degree of isolation of data between concurrent 
transactions. The default SQL Server isolation level is Read Committed. Here are the other 
isolation levels (in the ascending order of isolation): Read Uncommitted, Read Committed, 
Repeatable Read, Serializable. See SQL Server books online for an explanation of the 
isolation levels. Be sure to read about SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL, which lets 
you customize the isolation level at the connection level."
"CREATE INDEX myIndex ON myTable(myColumn)
What type of Index will get created after executing the above statement?
Non-clustered index. Important thing to note: By default a clustered index gets created on 
the primary key, unless specified otherwise."
"What's the maximum size of a row?
8060 bytes. Don't be surprised with questions like 'what is the maximum number of 
columns per table'. Check out SQL Server books online for the page titled: ""Maximum 
Capacity Specifications""."
"Explain Active/Active and Active/Passive cluster configurations
Hopefully you have experience setting up cluster servers. But if you don't, at least be 
familiar with the way clustering works and the two clustering configurations Active/Active 
and Active/Passive. SQL Server books online has enough information on this topic and 
there is a good white paper available on Microsoft site."
"Explain the architecture of SQL Server
This is a very important question and you better be able to answer it if consider yourself a 
DBA. SQL Server books online is the best place to read about SQL Server architecture. Read 
up the chapter dedicated to SQL Server Architecture."
". What is lock escalation?
Lock escalation is the process of converting a lot of low level locks (like row locks, page 
locks) into higher level locks (like table locks). Every lock is a memory structure too many 
locks would mean, more memory being occupied by locks. To prevent this from happening, 
SQL Server escalates the many fine-grain locks to fewer coarse-grain locks. Lock escalation 
threshold was definable in SQL Server 6.5, but from SQL Server 7.0 onwards it's 
dynamically managed by SQL Server."
"What is the difference between DELETE TABLE and TRUNCATE TABLE 
commands?
DELETE TABLE is a logged operation, so the deletion of each row gets logged in the 
transaction log, which makes it slow. TRUNCATE TABLE also deletes all the rows in a table,
but it won't log the deletion of each row, instead it logs the de-allocation of the data pages 
of the table, which makes it faster. Of course, TRUNCATE TABLE can be rolled back."
"Explain the storage models of OLAP
Check out MOLAP, ROLAP and HOLAP in SQL Server books online for more information."
"What are the new features introduced in SQL Server 2000 (or the latest release of 
SQL Server at the time of your interview)? What changed between the previous 
version of SQL Server and the current version?
This question is generally asked to see how current is your knowledge. Generally there is a 
section in the beginning of the books online titled ""What's New"", which has all such 
information. Of course, reading just that is not enough, you should have tried those things 
to better answer the questions. Also check out the section titled ""Backward Compatibility"" 
in books online which talks about the changes that have taken place in the new version."
"What are constraints? Explain different types of constraints
Constraints enable the RDBMS enforce the integrity of the database automatically, without 
needing you to create triggers, rule or defaults.
Types of constraints: NOT NULL, CHECK, UNIQUE, PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY
For an explanation of these constraints see books online for the pages titled: ""Constraints"" 
and ""CREATE TABLE"", ""ALTER TABLE"
". What is an index? What are the types of indexes? How many clustered indexes 
can be created on a table? I create a separate index on each column of a table. what 
are the advantages and disadvantages of this approach?
Indexes in SQL Server are similar to the indexes in books. They help SQL Server retrieve the 
data quicker.
Indexes are of two types. Clustered indexes and non-clustered indexes. When you createe a 
clustered index on a table, all the rows in the table are stored in the order of the clustered 
index key. So, there can be only one clustered index per table. Non-clustered indexes have 
their own storage separate from the table data storage. Non-clustered indexes are stored as 
B-tree structures (so do clustered indexes), with the leaf level nodes having the index key 
and it's row locater. The row located could be the RID or the Clustered index key, 
depending up on the absence or presence of clustered index on the table.
If you create an index on each column of a table, it improves the query performance, as the 
query optimizer can choose from all the existing indexes to come up with an efficient 
execution plan. At the same time, data modification operations (such as INSERT, UPDATE, 
DELETE) will become slow, as every time data changes in the table, all the indexes need to 
be updated. Another disadvantage is that, indexes need disk space, the more indexes you 
have, more disk space is used."
"What is RAID and what are different types of RAID configurations?
RAID stands for Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks, used to provide fault tolerance to 
database servers. There are six RAID levels 0 through 5 offering different levels of 
performance, fault tolerance. MSDN has some information about RAID levels and for 
detailed information, check out the RAID advisory board's homepage."
"What are the steps you will take to improve performance of a poor performing 
query?
This is a very open ended question and there could be a lot of reasons behind the poor 
performance of a query. But some general issues that you could talk about would be: No 
indexes, table scans, missing or out of date statistics, blocking, excess recompilations of 
stored procedures, procedures and triggers without SET NOCOUNT ON, poorly written 
query with unnecessarily complicated joins, too much normalization, excess usage of
cursors and temporary tables.
Some of the tools/ways that help you troubleshooting performance problems are: SET 
SHOWPLAN_ALL ON, SET SHOWPLAN_TEXT ON, SET STATISTICS IO ON, SQL Server 
Profiler, Windows NT /2000 Performance monitor, Graphical execution plan in Query 
Analyzer."
"What are the steps you will take, if you are tasked with securing an SQL Server?
Again this is another open ended question. Here are some things you could talk about: 
Preferring NT authentication, using server, database and application roles to control access 
to the data, securing the physical database files using NTFS permissions, using an 
unguessable SA password, restricting physical access to the SQL Server, renaming the 
Administrator account on the SQL Server computer, disabling the Guest account, enabling 
auditing, using multiprotocol encryption, setting up SSL, setting up firewalls, isolating SQL 
Server from the web server etc."
"What is a deadlock and what is a live lock? How will you go about resolving 
deadlocks?
Deadlock is a situation when two processes, each having a lock on one piece of data, 
attempt to acquire a lock on the other's piece. Each process would wait indefinitely for the 
other to release the lock, unless one of the user processes is terminated. SQL Server detects 
deadlocks and terminates one user's process.
A live lock is one, where a request for an exclusive lock is repeatedly denied because a 
series of overlapping shared locks keeps interfering. SQL Server detects the situation after 
four denials and refuses further shared locks. A live lock also occurs when read 
transactions monopolize a table or page, forcing a write transaction to wait indefinitely"
"What is blocking and how would you troubleshoot it?
Blocking happens when one connection from an application holds a lock and a second 
connection requires a conflicting lock type. This forces the second connection to wait, 
blocked on the first."
"Explain CREATE DATABASE syntax
Many of us are used to creating databases from the Enterprise Manager or by just issuing 
the command: CREATE DATABAE MyDB. But what if you have to create a database with 
two file groups, one on drive C and the other on drive D with log on drive E with an initial 
size of 600 MB and with a growth factor of 15%? That's why being a DBA you should be 
familiar with the CREATE DATABASE syntax. Check out SQL Server books online for more 
information."
"How to restart SQL Server in single user mode? How to start SQL Server in 
minimal configuration mode?
SQL Server can be started from command line, using the SQLSERVR.EXE. This EXE has 
some very important parameters with which a DBA should be familiar with. -m is used for 
starting SQL Server in single user mode and -f is used to start the SQL Server in minimal 
configuration mode. Check out SQL Server books online for more parameters and their 
explanations."
"As a part of your job, what are the DBCC commands that you commonly use for 
database maintenance?
DBCC CHECKDB, DBCC CHECKTABLE, DBCC CHECKCATALOG, DBCC CHECKALLOC, DBCC 
SHOWCONTIG, DBCC SHRINKDATABASE, DBCC SHRINKFILE etc. But there are a whole 
load of DBCC commands which are very useful for DBAs. Check out SQL Server books 
online for more information."
"What are statistics, under what circumstances they go out of date, how do you 
update them?
Statistics determine the selectivity of the indexes. If an indexed column has unique values 
then the selectivity of that index is more, as opposed to an index with non-unique values. 
Query optimizer uses these indexes in determining whether to choose an index or not 
while executing a query.
Some situations under which you should update statistics:
1) If there is significant change in the key values in the index
2) If a large amount of data in an indexed column has been added, changed, or removed 
(that is, if the distribution of key values has changed), or the table has been truncated using 
the TRUNCATE TABLE statement and then repopulated
3) Database is upgraded from a previous version"
"What are the different ways of moving data/databases between servers and 
databases in SQL Server?
There are lots of options available, you have to choose your option depending upon your 
requirements. Some of the options you have are: BACKUP/RESTORE, dettaching and 
attaching databases, replication, DTS, BCP, logshipping, INSERT...SELECT, SELECT...INTO, 
creating INSERT scripts to generate data."
"Explain different types of BACKUPs available in SQL Server? Given a particular 
scenario, how would you go about choosing a backup plan?
Types of backups you can create in SQL Server 7.0+ are Full database backup, differential 
database backup, transaction log backup, file group backup. Check out the BACKUP and 
RESTORE commands in SQL Server books online. Be prepared to write the commands in 
your interview. Books online also has information on detailed backup/restore architecture 
and when one should go for a particular kind of backup"
"What is database replication? What are the different types of replication you can 
set up in SQL Server?
Replication is the process of copying/moving data between databases on the same or 
different servers. SQL Server supports the following types of replication scenarios:
o Snapshot replication
o Transactional replication (with immediate updating subscribers, with queued updating 
subscribers)
o Merge replication"
"How to determine the service pack currently installed on SQL Server?
The global variable @@Version stores the build number of the sqlservr.exe, which is used 
to determine the service pack installed. To know more about this process visit"
"What are cursors? Explain different types of cursors. What are the disadvantages 
of cursors? How can you avoid cursors?
Cursors allow row-by-row processing of the result sets.
Types of cursors: Static, Dynamic, Forward-only, Keyset-driven. See books online for more 
information. Disadvantages of cursors: Each time you fetch a row from the cursor, it results in a 
network roundtrip, where as a normal SELECT query makes only one rowundtrip, however 
large the resultset is. Cursors are also costly because they require more resources and 
temporary storage (results in more IO operations). Furthere, there are restrictions on the 
SELECT statements that can be used with some types of cursors.
Most of the times, set based operations can be used instead of cursors. Here is an example:
If you have to give a flat hike to your employees using the following criteria:
Salary between 30000 and 40000 -- 5000 hike
Salary between 40000 and 55000 -- 7000 hike
Salary between 55000 and 65000 -- 9000 hike
In this situation many developers tend to use a cursor, determine each employee's salary 
and update his salary according to the above formula. But the same can be achieved by 
multiple update statements or can be combined in a single UPDATE statement as shown 
below:
UPDATE tbl_emp SET salary =
CASE WHEN salary BETWEEN 30000 AND 40000 THEN salary + 5000
WHEN salary BETWEEN 40000 AND 55000 THEN salary + 7000
WHEN salary BETWEEN 55000 AND 65000 THEN salary + 10000
END
Another situation in which developers tend to use cursors: You need to call a stored 
procedure when a column in a particular row meets certain condition. You don't have to 
use cursors for this. This can be achieved using WHILE loop, as long as there is a unique key 
to identify each row."
"Write down the general syntax for a SELECT statements covering all the options
Here's the basic syntax: (Also checkout SELECT in books online for advanced syntax).
SELECT select_list
[INTO new_table_]
FROM table_source
[WHERE search_condition]
[GROUP BY group_by_expression]
[HAVING search_condition]
[ORDER BY order_expression [ASC | DESC] ]"
". What is a join and explain different types of joins
Joins are used in queries to explain how different tables are related. Joins also let you select 
data from a table depending upon data from another table.
Types of joins: INNER JOINs, OUTER JOINs, CROSS JOINs,OUTER JOINs are further classified 
as LEFT OUTER JOINS, RIGHT OUTER JOINS and FULL OUTER JOINS"
". Can you have a nested transaction?
Yes, very much. Check out BEGIN TRAN, COMMIT, ROLLBACK, SAVE TRAN and 
@@TRANCOUNT"
"What is an extended stored procedure? Can you instantiate a COM object by using 
T-SQL?
An extended stored procedure is a function within a DLL (written in a programming 
language like C, C++ using Open Data Services (ODS) API) that can be called from T-SQL,just 
the way we call normal stored procedures using the EXEC statement. See books online to 
learn how to create extended stored procedures and how to add them to SQL Server.
Yes, you can instantiate a COM (written in languages like VB, VC++) object from T-SQL by 
using sp_OA Create stored procedure."
"What is the system function to get the current user's user id?
USER_ID().Also check out other system functions like USER_NAME(), SYSTEM_USER, 
SESSION_USER, CURRENT_USER, USER, SUSER_SID(), HOST_NAME()."
"What are triggers? How many triggers you can have on a table? How to invoke a 
trigger on demand?
Triggers are special kind of stored procedures that get executed automatically when an 
INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE operation takes place on a table.
In SQL Server 6.5 you could define only 3 triggers per table, one for INSERT, one for 
UPDATE and one for DELETE. From SQL Server 7.0 onwards, this restriction is gone, and 
you could create multiple triggers per each action. But in 7.0 there's no way to control the 
order in which the triggers fire. In SQL Server 2000 you could specify which trigger fires 
first or fires last using sp_settriggerorder
Triggers can't be invoked on demand. They get triggered only when an associated action 
(INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) happens on the table on which they are defined.
Triggers are generally used to implement business rules, auditing. Triggers can also be 
used to extend the referential integrity checks, but wherever possible, use constraints for 
this purpose, instead of triggers, as constraints are much faster.
Till SQL Server 7.0, triggers fire only after the data modification operation happens. So in a 
way, they are called post triggers. But in SQL Server 2000 you could create pre triggers 
also. Search SQL Server 2000 books online for INSTEAD OF triggers."
"There is a trigger defined for INSERT operations on a table, in an OLTP system. 
The trigger is written to instantiate a COM object and pass the newly insterted rows 
to it for some custom processing. What do you think of this implementation? Can this 
be implemented better?
Instantiating COM objects is a time consuming process and since you are doing it from 
within a trigger, it slows down the data insertion process. Same is the case with sending 
emails from triggers. This scenario can be better implemented by logging all the necessary 
data into a separate table, and have a job which periodically checks this table and does the 
needful."
"What is a self join? Explain it with an example
Self join is just like any other join, except that two instances of the same table will be joined 
in the query. Here is an example: Employees table which contains rows for normal 
employees as well as managers. So, to find out the managers of all the employees, you need 
a self join.
CREATE TABLE emp
(
empid int,
mgrid int,
empname char(10)
)
INSERT emp SELECT 1,2,'Vyas'
INSERT emp SELECT 2,3,'Mohan'
INSERT emp SELECT 3,NULL,'Shobha'
INSERT emp SELECT 4,2,'Shridhar'
INSERT emp SELECT 5,2,'Sourabh'
SELECT t1.empname [Employee], t2.empname [Manager]
FROM emp t1, emp t2
WHERE t1.mgrid = t2.empid 
Here's an advanced query using a LEFT OUTER JOIN that even returns the employees 
without managers (super bosses)
SELECT t1.empname [Employee], COALESCE(t2.empname, 'No manager') [Manager]
FROM emp t1 LEFT OUTER JOIN emp t2 ON t1.mgrid = t2.empid"
"Define Fact tables and dimension tables.
Fact tables are central tables in data warehousing. They contain the aggregate values that 
are used in business process."
"Explain the ETL process in Data warehousing.
Extraction, Transformation and loading are different stages in data warehousing."
"What is Data mining?
Data mining is a process of analyzing current data and summarizing the information in 
more useful manner."
"What are indexes?
Index can be thought as index of the book that is used for fast retrieval of information.
Index uses one or more column index keys and pointers to the record to locate record."
".Explain the types of indexes?
Clustered index
Non-clustered"
"Define SQL.
SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It allows access, insert/update/delete records 
and retrieve data from the database"
"What is RDBMS? Explain its features.
RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System. It organizes data into related 
rows and columns."
"What is an Entity-Relationship diagram?
It is a graphical representation of tables with the relationship between them."
"Define referential integrity.
It is the rules that are applied when the relationships are created. It ensures integrity of 
data and prevents inconsistent data into the tables."
"Define Primary key and Foreign key.
A column or combination of columns that identify a row of data in a table is Primary Key."
"Define alternate key.
There can be a key apart from primary key in a table that can also be a key. This key may or 
may not be a unique key"
"Delete vs. Truncate table.
Delete logs the deletion of each row whereas Truncate doesn't log deleted rows in the 
transaction log. This makes truncate command is bit faster than Delete command."
".Define constraints.
Constraints enforce integrity of the database. Constraints can be of following types 
Not Null
Check
Unique
Primary key
Foreign key"
"Define stored procedure.Stored procedure is a set of pre-compiled SQL statements, 
executed when it is called in the program."
"Define Trigger.
Triggers are similar to stored procedure except it is executed automatically when any 
operations are occurred on the table."
"What is RDBMS?
Relational Data Base Management Systems (RDBMS) are database management systems 
that maintain data records and indices in tables. Relationships may be created and 
maintained across and among the data and tables. In a relational database, relationships 
between data items are expressed by means of tables. Interdependencies among these 
tables are expressed by data values rather than by pointers. This allows a high degree of 
data independence. An RDBMS has the capability to recombine the data items from 
different files, providing powerful tools for data usage."
"What are the properties of the Relational tables?
Relational tables have six properties: 
1. Values are atomic.
2. Column values are of the same kind.
3. Each row is unique.
4. The sequence of columns is insignificant.
5. The sequence of rows is insignificant.
6. Each column must have a unique name."
"What is Normalization?
Database normalization is a data design and organization process applied to data 
structures based on rules that help building relational databases. In relational database 
design, the process of organizing data to minimize redundancy is called normalization. 
Normalization usually involves dividing a database into two or more tables and defining 
relationships between the tables. The objective is to isolate data so that additions, 
deletions, and modifications of a field can be made in just one table and then propagated 
through the rest of the database via the defined relationships."
"What is De-normalization?
De-normalization is the process of attempting to optimize the performance of a database by 
adding redundant data. It is sometimes necessary because current DBMSs implement the 
relational model poorly. A true relational DBMS would allow for a fully normalized 
database at the logical level, while providing physical storage of data that is tuned for high 
performance. De-normalization is a technique to move from higher to lower normal forms 
of database modeling in order to speed up database access."
"What are different normalization forms?
1. 1NF: Eliminate Repeating Groups Make a separate table for each set of related 
attributes, and give each table a primary key. Each field contains at most one value 
from its attribute domain. 2NF: Eliminate Redundant Data If an attribute depends on only part of a multi valued key, remove it to a separate table.
3. 3NF: Eliminate Columns Not Dependent On Key If attributes do not contribute to 
a description of the key, remove them to a separate table. All attributes must be 
directly dependent on the primary key.
4. BCNF: Boyce-Codd Normal Form If there are non-trivial dependencies between 
candidate key attributes, separate them out into distinct tables.
5. 4NF: Isolate Independent Multiple Relationships No table may contain two or 
more 1:n or n:m relationships that are not directly related.
6. 5NF: Isolate Semantically Related Multiple Relationships There may be practical 
constrains on information that justify separating logically related many-to-many 
relationships.
7. ONF: Optimal Normal Form A model limited to only simple (elemental) facts, as 
expressed in Object Role Model notation.
8. DKNF: Domain-Key Normal Form A model free from all modification anomalies is 
said to be in DKNF.
Remember, these normalization guidelines are cumulative. For a database to be in 3NF, it 
must first fulfill all the criteria of a 2NF and 1NF database."
"What is Stored Procedure?
A stored procedure is a named group of SQL statements that have been previously created 
and stored in the server database. Stored procedures accept input parameters so that a 
single procedure can be used over the network by several clients using different input data. 
And when the procedure is modified, all clients automatically get the new version. Stored 
procedures reduce network traffic and improve performance. Stored procedures can be 
used to help ensure the integrity of the database.
e.g. sp_helpdb, sp_renamedb, sp_depends etc."
"What is Trigger?
A trigger is a SQL procedure that initiates an action when an event (INSERT, DELETE or 
UPDATE) occurs. Triggers are stored in and managed by the DBMS. Triggers are used to 
maintain the referential integrity of data by changing the data in a systematic fashion. A 
trigger cannot be called or executed; DBMS automatically fires the trigger as a result of a 
data modification to the associated table. Triggers can be viewed as similar to stored
procedures in that both consist of procedural logic that is stored at the database level. 
Stored procedures, however, are not event-drive and are not attached to a specific table as 
triggers are. Stored procedures are explicitly executed by invoking a CALL to the procedure 
while triggers are implicitly executed. In addition, triggers can also execute stored 
procedures."
". What is Nested Trigger?
A trigger can also contain INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE logic within itself, so when the 
trigger is fired because of data modification it can also cause another data modification, 
thereby firing another trigger. A trigger that contains data modification logic within itself is 
called a nested trigger."
"What is View?
A simple view can be thought of as a subset of a table. It can be used for retrieving data, as 
well as updating or deleting rows. Rows updated or deleted in the view are updated or 
deleted in the table the view was created with. It should also be noted that as data in the 
original table changes, so does data in the view, as views are the way to look at part of the 
original table. The results of using a view are not permanently stored in the database. The 
data accessed through a view is actually constructed using standard T-SQL select command 
and can come from one to many different base tables or even other views."
"What is Index?
An index is a physical structure containing pointers to the data. Indices are created in an 
existing table to locate rows more quickly and efficiently. It is possible to create an index on 
one or more columns of a table, and each index is given a name. The users cannot see the 
indexes; they are just used to speed up queries. Effective indexes are one of the best ways 
to improve performance in a database application. A table scan happens when there is no 
index available to help a query. In a table scan SQL Server examines every row in the table 
to satisfy the query results. Table scans are sometimes unavoidable, but on large tables, 
scans have a terrific impact on performance."
"What is a Linked Server?
Linked Servers is a concept in SQL Server by which we can add other SQL Server to a Group 
and query both the SQL Server dbs using T-SQL Statements. With a linked server, you can 
create very clean, easy to follow, SQL statements that allow remote data to be retrieved, 
joined and combined with local data. Stored Procedure sp_addlinkedserver, 
sp_addlinkedserverlogin will be used add new Linked Server."
"What is Cursor?
Cursor is a database object used by applications to manipulate data in a set on a row-by row basis, instead of the typical SQL commands that operate on all the rows in the set at 
one time. 
In order to work with a cursor we need to perform some steps in the following order:
1. Declare cursor 
2. Open cursor
3. Fetch row from the cursor 4. Process fetched row
5. Close cursor
6. De-allocate cursor"
"What is Collation?
Collation refers to a set of rules that determine how data is sorted and compared. Character 
data is sorted using rules that define the correct character sequence, with options for 
specifying case sensitivity, accent marks, kana character types and character width."
"What is Difference between Function and Stored Procedure?
UDF can be used in the SQL statements anywhere in the WHERE/HAVING/SELECT section 
where as Stored procedures cannot be. UDFs that return tables can be treated as another 
row set. This can be used in JOINs with other tables. Inline UDF's can be thought of as views 
that take parameters and can be used in JOINs and other Row set operations."
"What is sub-query? Explain properties of sub-query?
Sub-queries are often referred to as sub-selects, as they allow a SELECT statement to be 
executed arbitrarily within the body of another SQL statement. A sub-query is executed by 
enclosing it in a set of parentheses. Sub-queries are generally used to return a single row as 
an atomic value, though they may be used to compare values against multiple rows with 
the IN keyword.
A subquery is a SELECT statement that is nested within another T-SQL statement. A
subquery SELECT statement if executed independently of the T-SQL statement, in which it 
is nested, will return a resultset. Meaning a subquery SELECT statement can standalone 
and is not depended on the statement in which it is nested. A subquery SELECT statement 
can return any number of values, and can be found in, the column list of a SELECT 
statement, a FROM, GROUP BY, HAVING, and/or ORDER BY clauses of a T-SQL statement. A 
Subquery can also be used as a parameter to a function call. Basically a subquery can be 
used anywhere an expression can be used."
"What are different Types of Join?
1. Cross Join A cross join that does not have a WHERE clause produces the Cartesian 
product of the tables involved in the join. The size of a Cartesian product result set is 
the number of rows in the first table multiplied by the number of rows in the second 
table. The common example is when company wants to combine each product with 
a pricing table to analyze each product at each price.
2. Inner Join A join that displays only the rows that have a match in both joined tables 
is known as inner Join. This is the default type of join in the Query and View 
Designer. 3. Outer Join A join that includes rows even if they do not have related rows in the 
joined table is an Outer Join. You can create three different outer join to specify the 
unmatched rows to be included: 
1. Left Outer Join: In Left Outer Join all rows in the first-named table i.e. ""left"" 
table, which appears leftmost in the JOIN clause are included. Unmatched 
rows in the right table do not appear.
2. Right Outer Join: In Right Outer Join all rows in the second-named table i.e. 
""right"" table, which appears rightmost in the JOIN clause are included. 
Unmatched rows in the left table are not included.
3. Full Outer Join: In Full Outer Join all rows in all joined tables are included, 
whether they are matched or not.
4. Self Join This is a particular case when one table joins to itself, with one or two 
aliases to avoid confusion. A self join can be of any type, as long as the joined tables 
are the same. A self join is rather unique in that it involves a relationship with only 
one table. The common example is when company has a hierarchal reporting 
structure whereby one member of staff reports to another. Self Join can be Outer 
Join or Inner Join."
"What are primary keys and foreign keys?
Primary keys are the unique identifiers for each row. They must contain unique values and 
cannot be null. Due to their importance in relational databases, Primary keys are the most 
fundamental of all keys and constraints. A table can have only one Primary key. Foreign 
keys are both a method of ensuring data integrity and a manifestation of the relationship 
between tables."
". What is User Defined Functions? What kind of User-Defined Functions can be 
created?
User-Defined Functions allow defining its own T-SQL functions that can accept 0 or more 
parameters and return a single scalar data value or a table data type.
Different Kinds of User-Defined Functions created are: 
1. Scalar User-Defined Function A Scalar user-defined function returns one of the 
scalar data types. Text, image and timestamp data types are not supported. These 
are the type of user-defined functions that most developers are used to in other 
programming languages. You pass in 0 to many parameters and you get a return 
value.
2. Inline Table-Value User-Defined Function An Inline Table-Value user-defined 
function returns a table data type and is an exceptional alternative to a view as the 
user-defined function can pass parameters into a T-SQL select command and in 
essence provide us with a parameterized, non-updateable view of the underlying 
tables.
3. Multi-statement Table-Value User-Defined Function A Multi-Statement Table Value user-defined function returns a table and is also an exceptional alternative to 
a view as the function can support multiple T-SQL statements to build the final result where the view is limited to a single SELECT statement. Also, the ability to 
pass parameters into a TSQL select command or a group of them gives us the 
capability to in essence create a parameterized, non-updateable view of the data in 
the underlying tables. Within the create function command you must define the 
table structure that is being returned. After creating this type of user-defined 
function, It can be used in the FROM clause of a T-SQL command unlike the behavior 
found when using a stored procedure which can also return record sets."
"What is Identity?
Identity (or AutoNumber) is a column that automatically generates numeric values. A start 
and increment value can be set, but most DBA leave these at 1. A GUID column also 
generates numbers; the value of this cannot be controlled. Identity/GUID columns do not 
need to be indexed."
"Which TCP/IP port does SQL Server run on? How can it be changed?
SQL Server runs on port 1433. It can be changed from the Network Utility TCP/IP 
properties."
"What are the difference between clustered and a non-clustered index?
1. A clustered index is a special type of index that reorders the way records in the 
table are physically stored. Therefore table can have only one clustered index. The 
leaf nodes of a clustered index contain the data pages.
2. A non clustered index is a special type of index in which the logical order of the 
index does not match the physical stored order of the rows on disk. The leaf node of 
a non clustered index does not consist of the data pages. Instead, the leaf nodes 
contain index rows."
"What are the different index configurations a table can have?
A table can have one of the following index configurations: 
1. No indexes 
2. A clustered index
3. A clustered index and many nonclustered indexes
4. A non clustered index 
5. Many non clustered indexes"
"What are different types of Collation Sensitivity?
1. Case sensitivity - A and a, B and b, etc.
2. Accent sensitivity
3. Kana Sensitivity - When Japanese kana characters Hiragana and Katakana are 
treated differently, it is called Kana sensitive. 4. Width sensitivity - A single-byte character (half-width) and the same character 
represented as a double-byte character (full-width) are treated differently than it is 
width sensitive."
". What is OLTP (Online Transaction Processing)?
In OLTP - online transaction processing systems relational database design use the 
discipline of data modeling and generally follow the Codd rules of data normalization in 
order to ensure absolute data integrity. Using these rules complex information is broken 
down into its most simple structures (a table) where all of the individual atomic level 
elements relate to each other and satisfy the normalization rules."
"What's the difference between a primary key and a unique key?
Both primary key and unique key enforces uniqueness of the column on which they are 
defined. But by default primary key creates a clustered index on the column, where are 
unique creates a non clustered index by default. Another major difference is that, primary 
key doesn't allow NULLs, but unique key allows one NULL only"
"What is difference between DELETE and TRUNCATE commands?
Delete command removes the rows from a table based on the condition that we provide 
with a WHERE clause. Truncate will actually remove all the rows from a table and there 
will be no data in the table after we run the truncate command. 
1. TRUNCATE: 
1. TRUNCATE is faster and uses fewer system and transaction log resources 
than DELETE.
2. TRUNCATE removes the data by deallocating the data pages used to store the 
table's data, and only the page deallocations are recorded in the transaction 
log. 
3. TRUNCATE removes all rows from a table, but the table structure, its 
columns, constraints, indexes and so on, remains. The counter used by an 
identity for new rows is reset to the seed for the column.
4. You cannot use TRUNCATE TABLE on a table referenced by a FOREIGN KEY 
constraint. Because TRUNCATE TABLE is not logged, it cannot activate a 
trigger.
5. TRUNCATE cannot be rolled back.
6. TRUNCATE is DDL Command.
7. TRUNCATE Resets identity of the table
2. DELETE: 
1. DELETE removes rows one at a time and records an entry in the transaction 
log for each deleted row. 
2. If you want to retain the identity counter, use DELETE instead. If you want to 
remove table definition and its data, use the DROP TABLE statement.
3. DELETE Can be used with or without a WHERE clause 4. DELETE Activates Triggers.
5. DELETE can be rolled back.
6. DELETE is DML Command.
7. DELETE does not reset identity of the table.
Note: DELETE and TRUNCATE both can be rolled back when surrounded by TRANSACTION 
if the current session is not closed. If TRUNCATE is written in Query Editor surrounded by
TRANSACTION and if session is closed, it can not be rolled back but DELETE can be rolled 
back."
"When is the use of UPDATE_STATISTICS command?
This command is basically used when a large processing of data has occurred. If a large 
amount of deletions any modification or Bulk Copy into the tables has occurred, it has to 
update the indexes to take these changes into account. UPDATE_STATISTICS updates the 
indexes on these tables accordingly"
"What is the difference between a HAVING CLAUSE and a WHERE CLAUSE?
They specify a search condition for a group or an aggregate. But the difference is that 
HAVING can be used only with the SELECT statement. HAVING is typically used in a GROUP 
BY clause. When GROUP BY is not used, HAVING behaves like a WHERE clause. Having 
Clause is basically used only with the GROUP BY function in a query whereas WHERE 
Clause is applied to each row before they are part of the GROUP BY function in a query."
"What are the properties and different Types of Sub-Queries?
1. Properties of Sub-Query
1. A sub-query must be enclosed in the parenthesis.
2. A sub-query must be put in the right hand of the comparison operator, and
3. A sub-query cannot contain an ORDER-BY clause.
4. A query can contain more than one sub-query.
2. Types of Sub-Query
1. Single-row sub-query, where the sub-query returns only one row.
2. Multiple-row sub-query, where the sub-query returns multiple rows,. and 
3. Multiple column sub-query, where the sub-query returns multiple columns"
"What is SQL Profiler?
SQL Profiler is a graphical tool that allows system administrators to monitor events in an 
instance of Microsoft SQL Server. You can capture and save data about each event to a file 
or SQL Server table to analyze later. For example, you can monitor a production 
environment to see which stored procedures are hampering performances by executing 
too slowly. Use SQL Profiler to monitor only the events in which you are interested. If traces are 
becoming too large, you can filter them based on the information you want, so that only a 
subset of the event data is collected. Monitoring too many events adds overhead to the 
server and the monitoring process and can cause the trace file or trace table to grow very 
large, especially when the monitoring process takes place over a long period of time."
"What are the authentication modes in SQL Server? How can it be changed?
Windows mode and Mixed Mode - SQL and Windows. To change authentication mode in 
SQL Server click Start, Programs, Microsoft SQL Server and click SQL Enterprise Manager to 
run SQL Enterprise Manager from the Microsoft SQL Server program group. Select the 
server then from the Tools menu select SQL Server Configuration Properties, and choose 
the Security page."
"Which command using Query Analyzer will give you the version of SQL server 
and operating system?
SELECT SERVERPROPERTY ('productversion'), SERVERPROPERTY ('productlevel'), 
SERVERPROPERTY ('edition')."
"What is SQL Server Agent?
SQL Server agent plays an important role in the day-to-day tasks of a database 
administrator (DBA). It is often overlooked as one of the main tools for SQL Server 
management. Its purpose is to ease the implementation of tasks for the DBA, with its full function scheduling engine, which allows you to schedule your own jobs and scripts."
"Can a stored procedure call itself or recursive stored procedure? How much 
level SP nesting is possible?
Yes. Because Transact-SQL supports recursion, you can write stored procedures that call 
themselves. Recursion can be defined as a method of problem solving wherein the solution 
is arrived at by repetitively applying it to subsets of the problem. A common application of 
recursive logic is to perform numeric computations that lend themselves to repetitive 
evaluation by the same processing steps. Stored procedures are nested when one stored 
procedure calls another or executes managed code by referencing a CLR routine, type, or 
aggregate. You can nest stored procedures and managed code references up to 32 levels."
"What is Log Shipping?
Log shipping is the process of automating the backup of database and transaction log files 
on a production SQL server, and then restoring them onto a standby server. Enterprise 
Editions only supports log shipping. In log shipping the transactional log file from one 
server is automatically updated into the backup database on the other server. If one server fails, the other server will have the same db and can be used this as the Disaster Recovery 
plan. The key feature of log shipping is that it will automatically backup transaction logs 
throughout the day and automatically restore them on the standby server at defined 
interval."
". Name 3 ways to get an accurate count of the number of records in a table?
SELECT * FROM table1 
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table1 
SELECT rows FROM sysindexes WHERE id = OBJECT_ID(table1) AND indid < 2"
"What does it mean to have QUOTED_IDENTIFIER ON? What are the implications 
of having it OFF?
When SET QUOTED_IDENTIFIER is ON, identifiers can be delimited by double quotation 
marks, and literals must be delimited by single quotation marks. When SET 
QUOTED_IDENTIFIER is OFF, identifiers cannot be quoted and must follow all Transact SQL rules for identifiers."
"What is the difference between a Local and a Global temporary table?
1. A local temporary table exists only for the duration of a connection or, if defined 
inside a compound statement, for the duration of the compound statement. 
2. A global temporary table remains in the database permanently, but the rows exist 
only within a given connection. When connection is closed, the data in the global 
temporary table disappears. However, the table definition remains with the 
database for access when database is opened next time."
"What is the STUFF function and how does it differ from the REPLACE function?
STUFF function is used to overwrite existing characters. Using this syntax, STUFF 
(string_expression, start, length, replacement_characters), string_expression is the string 
that will have characters substituted, start is the starting position, length is the number of 
characters in the string that are substituted, and replacement_characters are the new 
characters interjected into the string. REPLACE function to replace existing characters of all 
occurrences. Using the syntax REPLACE (string_expression, search_string, 
replacement_string), where every incidence of search_string found in the string_expression 
will be replaced with replacement_string"
"What is PRIMARY KEY?
A PRIMARY KEY constraint is a unique identifier for a row within a database table. Every 
table should have a primary key constraint to uniquely identify each row and only one 
primary key constraint can be created for each table. The primary key constraints are used 
to enforce entity integrity"
"What is UNIQUE KEY constraint?
A UNIQUE constraint enforces the uniqueness of the values in a set of columns, so no 
duplicate values are entered. The unique key constraints are used to enforce entity 
integrity as the primary key constraints."
"What is FOREIGN KEY?
A FOREIGN KEY constraint prevents any actions that would destroy links between tables 
with the corresponding data values. A foreign key in one table points to a primary key in 
another table. Foreign keys prevent actions that would leave rows with foreign key values
when there are no primary keys with that value. The foreign key constraints are used to 
enforce referential integrity."
"What is CHECK Constraint?
A CHECK constraint is used to limit the values that can be placed in a column. The check 
constraints are used to enforce domain integrity."
"What is NOT NULL Constraint?
A NOT NULL constraint enforces that the column will not accept null values. The not null 
constraints are used to enforce domain integrity, as the check constraints."
". How to get @@ERROR and @@ROWCOUNT at the same time?
If @@Rowcount is checked after Error checking statement then it will have 0 as the value 
of @@Recordcount as it would have been reset. And if @@Recordcount is checked before 
the error-checking statement then @@Error would get reset. To get @@error and 
@@rowcount at the same time do both in same statement and store them in local variable. 
SELECT @RC = @@ROWCOUNT, @ER = @@ERROR"
"What is a Scheduled Jobs or What is a Scheduled Tasks?
Scheduled tasks let user automate processes that run on regular or predictable cycles. User 
can schedule administrative tasks, such as cube processing, to run during times of slow 
business activity. User can also determine the order in which tasks run by creating job 
steps within a SQL Server Agent job. E.g. back up database, Update Stats of Tables. Job steps give user control over flow of execution. If one job fails, user can configure SQL Server 
Agent to continue to run the remaining tasks or to stop execution."
"What are the advantages of using Stored Procedures?
1. Stored procedure can reduced network traffic and latency, boosting application 
performance. 
2. Stored procedure execution plans can be reused, staying cached in SQL Server's 
memory, reducing server overhead.
3. Stored procedures help promote code reuse.
4. Stored procedures can encapsulate logic. You can change stored procedure code 
without affecting clients.
5. Stored procedures provide better security to your data."
"What is a table called, if it has neither Cluster nor Non-cluster Index? What is it 
used for?
Unindexed table or Heap. Microsoft Press Books and Book on Line (BOL) refers it as Heap. 
A heap is a table that does not have a clustered index and, therefore, the pages are not 
linked by pointers. The IAM pages are the only structures that link the pages in a table 
together. Unindexed tables are good for fast storing of data. Many times it is better to drop 
all indexes from table and then do bulk of inserts and to restore those indexes after that."
"Can SQL Servers linked to other servers like Oracle?
SQL Server can be linked to any server provided it has OLE-DB provider from Microsoft to 
allow a link. E.g. Oracle has an OLE-DB provider for oracle that Microsoft provides to add it 
as linked server to SQL Server group"
"How to implement one-to-one, one-to-many and many-to-many relationships 
while designing tables?
One-to-One relationship can be implemented as a single table and rarely as two tables 
with primary and foreign key relationships. One-to-Many relationships are implemented 
by splitting the data into two tables with primary key and foreign key relationships. Many to-Many relationships are implemented using a junction table with the keys from both the 
tables forming the composite primary key of the junction table."
"What are the basic functions for master, msdb, model, tempdb and resource 
databases?
1. The master database holds information for all databases located on the SQL Server 
instance and is theglue that holds the engine together. Because SQL Server cannot 
start without a functioning masterdatabase, you must administer this database with 
care. 2. The msdb database stores information regarding database backups, SQL Agent 
information, DTS packages, SQL Server jobs, and some replication information such 
as for log shipping.
3. The tempdb holds temporary objects such as global and local temporary tables and 
stored procedures.
4. The model is essentially a template database used in the creation of any new user 
database created in the instance.
5. The resoure Database is a read-only database that contains all the system objects 
that are included with SQL Server. SQL Server system objects, such as sys.objects, 
are physically persisted in the Resource database, but they logically appear in the 
sys schema of every database. The Resource database does not contain user data or 
user metadata."
"What is Service Broker?
Service Broker is a message-queuing technology in SQL Server that allows developers to 
integrate SQL Server fully into distributed applications. Service Broker is feature which 
provides facility to SQL Server to send an asynchronous, transactional message. it allows a 
database to send a message to another database without waiting for the response, so the 
application will continue to function if the remote database is temporarily unavailable."
"Where SQL server user names and passwords are stored in SQL server?
They get stored in System Catalog Views sys.server_principals and sys.sql_logins."
"What is Policy Management?
Policy Management in SQL SERVER 2008 allows you to define and enforce policies for 
configuring and managing SQL Server across the enterprise. Policy-Based Management is 
configured in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS). Navigate to the Object Explorer and 
expand the Management node and the Policy Management node; you will see the Policies, 
Conditions, and Facets nodes."
"What is Replication and Database Mirroring?
Database mirroring can be used with replication to provide availability for the publication 
database. Database mirroring involves two copies of a single database that typically reside 
on different computers. At any given time, only one copy of the database is currently 
available to clients which are known as the principal database. Updates made by clients to 
the principal database are applied on the other copy of the database, known as the mirror 
database. Mirroring involves applying the transaction log from every insertion, update, or 
deletion made on the principal database onto the mirror database."
"What are Sparse Columns?
A sparse column is another tool used to reduce the amount of physical storage used in a 
database. They are the ordinary columns that have an optimized storage for null values. 
Sparse columns reduce the space requirements for null values at the cost of more overhead 
to retrieve nonnull values."
"What does TOP Operator Do?
The TOP operator is used to specify the number of rows to be returned by a query. The 
TOP operator has new addition in SQL SERVER 2008 that it accepts variables as well as 
literal values and can be used with INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETES statements."
"What is CTE?
CTE is an abbreviation Common Table Expression. A Common Table Expression (CTE) is an 
expression that can be thought of as a temporary result set which is defined within the 
execution of a single SQL statement. A CTE is similar to a derived table in that it is not 
stored as an object and lasts only for the duration of the query"
"What is MERGE Statement?
MERGE is a new feature that provides an efficient way to perform multiple DML 
operations. In previous versions of SQL Server, we had to write separate statements to 
INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE data based on certain conditions, but now, using MERGE 
statement we can include the logic of such data modifications in one statement that even 
checks when the data is matched then just update it and when unmatched then insert it. 
One of the most important advantages of MERGE statement is all the data is read and 
processed only once."
"What is Filtered Index?
Filtered Index is used to index a portion of rows in a table that means it applies filter on 
INDEX which improves query performance, reduce index maintenance costs, and reduce 
index storage costs compared with full-table indexes. When we see an Index created with 
some where clause then that is actually a FILTERED INDEX."
"Which are new data types introduced in SQL SERVER 2008?
1. The GEOMETRY Type: The GEOMETRY data type is a system .NET common 
language runtime (CLR) data type in SQL Server. This type represents data in a two dimensional Euclidean coordinate system.
2. The GEOGRAPHY Type: The GEOGRAPHY datatypes functions are the same as with 
GEOMETRY. The difference between the two is that when you specify GEOGRAPHY, 
you are usually specifying points in terms of latitude and longitude. 3. New Date and Time Datatypes: SQL Server 2008 introduces four new datatypes 
related to date and time: DATE, TIME, DATETIMEOFFSET, and DATETIME2. 
1. DATE: The new DATE type just stores the date itself. It is based on the 
Gregorian calendar and handles years from 1 to 9999. 
2. TIME: The new TIME (n) type stores time with a range of 00:00:00.0000000 
through 23:59:59.9999999. The precision is allowed with this type. TIME 
supports seconds down to 100 nanoseconds. The n in TIME (n) defines this 
level of fractional second precision, from 0 to 7 digits of precision. 
3. The DATETIMEOFFSET Type: DATETIMEOFFSET (n) is the time-zone aware version of a datetime datatype. The name will appear less odd when 
you consider what it really is: a date + a time + a time-zone offset. The offset 
is based on how far behind or ahead you are from Coordinated Universal 
Time (UTC) time.
4. The DATETIME2 Type: It is an extension of the datetime type in earlier 
versions of SQL Server. This new datatype has a date range covering dates 
from January 1 of year 1 through December 31 of year 9999. This is a definite 
improvement over the 1753 lower boundary of the datetime datatype. 
DATETIME2 not only includes the larger date range, but also has a timestamp 
and the same fractional precision that TIME type provides"
"What are the Advantages of using CTE?
1. Using CTE improves the readability and makes maintenance of complex queries 
easy. 
2. The query can be divided into separate, simple, logical building blocks which can be 
then used to build more complex CTEs until final result set is generated. 
3. CTE can be defined in functions, stored procedures, triggers or even views. 
4. After a CTE is defined, it can be used as a Table or a View and can SELECT, INSERT, 
UPDATE or DELETE Data."
"How would you handle error in SQL SERVER 2008?
SQL Server now supports the use of TRY...CATCH con handling. TRY...CATCH lets us 
build error handling at the level we need, in the way w to, by setting a region where 
if any error occurs, it will break out of the region and head to an error handler. 
The basic structure is as follows:
BEGIN TRY 
stmts.. 
END TRY
BEGIN CATCH
stmts..
END CATCH"
"What is Aggregate Functions?
Aggregate functions perform a calculation on a set of values and return a single value. 
Aggregate functions ignore NULL values except COUNT function. HAVING clause is used, 
along with GROUP BY, for filtering query using aggregate values.
Following functions are aggregate functions. 
AVG, MIN CHECKSUM_AGG, SUM, COUNT, STDEV, COUNT_BIG, STDEVP, GROUPING, VAR, 
MAX. VARP"
"What do you mean by Table Sample?
TABLESAMPLE allows you to extract a sampling of rows from a table in the FROM clause. 
The rows retrieved are random and they are not in any order. This sampling can be based 
on a percentage of number of rows. You can use TABLESAMPLE when only a sampling of 
rows is necessary for the application instead of a full result set."
"What is the difference between UNION and UNION ALL?
1. UNION The UNION command is used to select related information from two tables, 
much like the JOIN command. However, when using the UNION command all 
selected columns need to be of the same data type. With UNION, only distinct values 
are selected.
2. UNION ALL The UNION ALL command is equal to the UNION command, except that 
UNION ALL selects all values.
The difference between Union and Union all is that Union all will not eliminate duplicate 
rows, instead it just pulls all rows from all tables fitting your query specifics and combines 
them into a table."
"What is B-Tree?
The database server uses a B-tree structure to organize index information. B-Tree 
generally has following types of index pages or nodes: 
1. root node: A root node contains node pointers to branch nodes which can be only 
one.
2. branch node: A branch node contains pointers to leaf nodes or other branch nodes 
which can be two or more.
3. leaf nodes: A leaf node contains index items and orizantal pointers to other leaf 
nodes which can be many."
"What is a foreign key, and what is it used for?
A foreign key is used to establish relationships among relations in the relational model. 
Technically, a foreign key is a column (or columns) appearing in one relation that is (are) 
the primary key of another table. Although there may be exceptions, the values in the 
foreign key columns usually must correspond to values existing in the set of primary key 
values. This correspondence requirement is created in a database using a referential 
integrity constraint on the foreign key."
"What does it mean when we say that a relation is in Boyce-Codd Normal Form 
(BCNF)?
A relation is in BCNF when every determinant in the relation is a candidate key. This means 
that any possible primary key can determine all other attributes in the relation. Attributes 
may not be determined by non-candidate key attributes or part of a composite candidate 
key. Thus it is said ""I swear to construct my tables so that all nonkey columns are 
dependent on the key, the whole key and nothing but the key, so help me Codd!"""
"You have been given a set of tables with data and asked to create a new 
database to store them. When you examine the data values in the tables, what are 
you looking for?
(1) Multivalued dependencies, (2) Functional dependencies, (3) Candidate keys, (4) 
Primary keys and (5) Foreign keys."
"Explain the difference between attributes and identifiers.
Entities have attributes. Attributes are properties that describe the entity's characteristics. 
Entity instances have identifiers. Identifiers are attributes that name, or identify, entity 
instances."
"Name and describe three types of binary relationships.
1:1 - a single entity instance of one type is related to a single-entity instance of another 
type.
1:N - a single entity instance of one type is related to many-entity instances of another type.
M:N - many-entity instances of one type relate to many-entity instances of another type."
"What are stored procedures, and how do they differ from triggers?
A stored procedure is a program that is stored within the database and is compiled when 
used. They can receive input parameters and they can return results. Unlike triggers, their 
scope is database-wide; they can be used by any process that has permission to use the 
database stored procedure."
"What are the advantages of using stored procedures?
The advantages of stored procedures are (1) greater security, (2) decreased network 
traffic, (3) the fact that SQL can be optimized and (4) code sharing which leads to less work, 
standardized processing, and specialization among developers."
"What is the relationship of ODBC, OLE DB, and ADO?
Developed first, the ODBC standard is for relational databases; while the OLE DB standard 
provides functionality for both relational and other databases. Finally, ADO was developed 
to provide easier access to OLE DB data for the non-object-oriented programmer."
"Explain the differences between structured data and unstructured data.
Structured data are facts concerning objects and events. The most important structured 
data are numeric, character, and dates. Structured data are stored in tabular form. 
Unstructured data are multimedia data such as documents, photographs, maps, images, 
sound, and video clips. Unstructured data are most commonly found on Web servers and 
Web-enabled databases."
"What are dimension tables and definition of Fact tables?
These two questions are most commonly asked database interview questions. Fact tables 
are mainly central tables that are an integral part of data warehousing and dimension 
tables are used for describing the attributes of the fact tables. Both of these tables are 
important and play an important role in maintaining the database management system."
"What is Data Warehouse?
A data warehouse is a subject-oriented, integrated, time-variant and non-volatile collection 
of data in support of management's decision making process. 
Subject-Oriented: A data warehouse can be used to analyze a particular subject area. For 
example, ""sales"" can be a particular subject.
Integrated: A data warehouse integrates data from multiple data sources. For example, 
source A and source B may have different ways of identifying a product, but in a data 
warehouse, there will be only a single way of identifying a product.
Time-Variant: Historical data is kept in a data warehouse. For example, one can retrieve 
data from 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, or even older data from a data warehouse. This 
contrasts with a transactions system, where often only the most recent data is kept. For 
example, a transaction system may hold the most recent address of a customer, where a 
data warehouse can hold all addresses associated with a customer. Non-volatile: Once data is in the data warehouse, it will not change. So, historical data in a 
data warehouse should never be altered."
"Data mining is a term from computer science. Sometimes it is also called knowledge 
discovery in databases (KDD). Data mining is about finding new information in a lot of 
data. The information obtained from data mining is hopefully both new and useful."

Linear Regression Interview Questions Linear Regression Basic Interview Questions
"1. What is linear regression, and how does it work? Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It is called ""linear"" because the model assumes a linear relationship between the dependent and independent variables. Linear regression can be classified into two types: Simple Linear Regression and Multiple Linear Regression. Simple Linear Regression involves using one independent variable to model the relationship between that variable and a dependent variable. On the other hand, Multiple Linear Regression involves using more than one independent variable to model the relationship with the dependent variable. In linear regression, a line of best fit is plotted on a scatter plot of the data points, and the equation of this line is used to make predictions about the dependent variable based on the values of the independent variable(s). The line is determined by finding the values of the slope and intercept that minimize the sum of the squared diﬀerences between the observed values and the values predicted by the line. Linear Regression Interview Questions Linear regression can be used for both continuous and categorical dependent variables and can handle multiple independent variables. It is commonly used in fields such as economics and finance to model the relationship between variables and make predictions or forecasts."
"2. What are the assumptions of a linear regression model? The assumptions of a linear regression model are: The relationship between the independent and dependent variables is linear. The residuals, or errors, are normally distributed with a mean of zero and a constant variance. The independent variables are not correlated with each other (i.e. they are not collinear). The residuals are independent of each other (i.e. they are not autocorrelated). The model includes all the relevant independent variables needed to accurately predict the dependent variable."
"3. What are outliers? How do you detect and treat them? How do you deal with outliers in a linear regression model? A value that is significantly diﬀerent from the mean or the median is considered to be an outlier in statistics. There is a possibility of erroneous results due to measurement errors. There is also the possibility of an experimental error being indicated. Linear Regression Interview Questions In a scenario like this one, it is essential to clear the database of any information that could be considered oﬀensive. In the absence of detection and correction, they are capable of wreaking havoc on statistical analysis. Utilizing mathematical methods alone does not allow for the determination of an outlier with any degree of accuracy. The process of locating an outlier and determining whether or not it is significant is highly dependent on personal interpretation. On the other hand, there are a number of methods that can be used to identify deviations from the norm. Some are based on models, while others are graphically represented as normal probability plots. Boxplots are one example of the hybrid approaches that are currently available. If you discover an outlier in your data, you should either eliminate it or find a way to fix it so that your analysis can be trusted. The Z-score and the IQR score are two methods that can be utilized in order to identify and eliminate extreme data points. There are several ways to deal with outliers in a linear regression model: Linear Regression Interview Questions Remove the outlier data points: This is a simple and straightforward approach, but it may not always be possible or advisable if the outlier data points contain important information. Use a robust regression model: Robust regression models are designed to be less sensitive to the presence of outliers and can provide more accurate predictions. Transform the data: Applying a transformation, such as a log or square root, to the data can make it more normally distributed and reduce the impact of outliers. Use a diﬀerent regression method: Some regression methods, such as non- parametric methods, are less sensitive to outliers and can provide more accurate predictions. Use a combination of methods: Combining multiple methods, such as removing some outliers, using a robust regression model, and transforming the data, can provide the best results."
"4. How do you determine the best fit line for a linear regression model? To determine the best-fit line for a linear regression model, the following steps can be taken: Linear Regression Interview Questions Collect a sample of data points that represent the relationship between the dependent and independent variables. Plot the data points on a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between the variables. Calculate the linear regression equation using the least squares method to find the line that minimizes the distance between the data points and the line. Use the linear regression equation to predict the value of the dependent variable for a given value of the independent variable. Evaluate the accuracy of the model by calculating the coeﬀicient of determination (R2) and the root mean squared error (RMSE). Adjust the model, if necessary, by adding or removing variables or transforming the data to improve the fit of the model. Use the adjusted model to make predictions and continue to evaluate its performance."
"5. What is the diﬀerence between simple and multiple linear regression? Linear Regression Interview Questions Simple linear regression models the relationship between one independent variable and one dependent variable, while multiple linear regression models the relationship between multiple independent variables and one dependent variable. The goal of both methods is to find a linear model that best fits the data and can be used to make predictions about the dependent variable based on the independent variables.

"6. What is linear Regression Analysis? Linear regression analysis is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. The analysis assumes that there is a linear relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variable(s) and seeks to fit a straight line that best represents that relationship. The resulting model can be used to make predictions about the dependent variable based on the values of the independent variable(s). Linear regression analysis is widely used in various fields, such as finance, economics, and social sciences, to understand the relationships between variables and make predictions about future outcomes. In linear regression analysis, the coeﬀicient of determination is used to evaluate the goodness of fit of the model. It can be used to compare diﬀerent regression models and to determine whether the addition of new variables to a model significantly improves the fit."
"7. What is multicollinearity and how does it aﬀect linear regression analysis? Linear Regression Interview Questions Multicollinearity refers to a situation in which two or more independent variables in a linear regression model are highly correlated with each other. This can create problems in the regression analysis, as it can be diﬀicult to determine the individual eﬀects of each independent variable on the dependent variable. When two or more independent variables are highly correlated, it becomes diﬀicult to isolate the eﬀect of each variable on the dependent variable. The regression model may indicate that both variables are significant predictors of the dependent variable, but it can be diﬀicult to determine which variable is actually responsible for the observed eﬀect. Multicollinearity in linear regression: Multicollinearity occurs when two or more independent variables in a linear regression model are highly correlated with each other. It makes it diﬀicult to determine the individual eﬀects of each independent variable on the dependent variable. It can lead to unstable and unreliable estimates of the regression coeﬀicients and inflated standard errors of the coeﬀicients, aﬀecting the accuracy of the regression results. It can also lead to a model that performs poorly in predicting the dependent variable by overemphasizing the importance of the correlated variables and failing to identify other important predictors. Multicollinearity can be identified by looking at the correlation matrix of the independent variables and calculating the variance inflation factor (VIF). A VIF value greater than 5 or 10 is o"
"8. What is the diﬀerence between linear regression and logistic regression? Linear Regression Interview Questions Linear regression is a statistical method used for predicting a numerical outcome, such as the price of a house or the likelihood of a person developing a disease. Logistic regression, on the other hand, is used for predicting a binary outcome, such as whether a person will pass or fail a test, or whether a customer will churn or not. The main diﬀerence between these two types of regression lies in the nature of the output they predict. Linear regression is used to predict a continuous output, while logistic regression is used to predict a binary output. This means that the equations and the processes used to train and evaluate the models are diﬀerent for each type of regression. Linear Regression Interview Questions Linear Regression Logistic Regression Type of AnalysisRegression analysis to establish a linear relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.Classification analysis to predict the probability of a binary or categorical outcome based on one or more independent variables.

9. What are the common types of errors in linear regression analysis? There are several types of errors that can occur in linear regression analysis. Some of the most common include: Overestimating or underestimating the relationship between the variables: This can happen if the model is too complex or if important variables are le
"10. What is the diﬀerence between a dependent and independent variable in linear regression? In linear regression, the dependent variable is the variable that is being predicted or explained by the model. This is the variable that is dependent on the independent variables. The independent variable, on the other hand, is the variable that is used to predict or explain the dependent variable. It is independent of the dependent variable and is not aﬀected by its value. Linear Regression Interview Questions Aspect Dependent Variable Independent Variable DefinitionThe variable that is being predicted or explainedThe variable used to make the prediction or explanation Also known asResponse variable, outcome variable, predicted variablePredictor variable, explanatory variable, input variable Role in regression equationY-axis variable X-axis variable NotationUsually represented as ""Y""Usually represented as ""X"" AssumptionThe dependent variable is assumed to be aﬀected by the independent variable(s)The independent variable(s) are assumed to have a linear relationship with the dependent variable GoalTo understand how changes in the independent variable(s) aﬀect the dependent variableTo use the independent variable(s) to predict or explain the values of the dependent variable ExampleIn a study on the eﬀect of hours of study on exam scores, exam score would be the dependentvariableIn the same study, hours of study would be the independent variable Linear Regression Interview Questions"
"11. What is an interaction term in linear regression and how is it used? An interaction term in linear regression is a term in the regression model that represents the eﬀect of the interaction between two or more variables on the dependent variable. It is used to evaluate the combined eﬀect of multiple variables on the dependent variable, and to identify non-linear relationships between the variables. In a regression model with an interaction term, the eﬀect of one variable on the dependent variable may be diﬀerent at diﬀerent levels of the other variable. This allows for a more nuanced understanding of the relationships between the variables in the model."
"12. What is the diﬀerence between biased and unbiased estimates in linear regression? Biased estimates in linear regression refer to estimates that consistently over- or underestimate the true population parameter. This can occur due to various factors, such as missing information or incorrect assumptions about the data. Unbiased estimates, on the other hand, accurately reflect the true population parameter, without any systematic over- or underestimation. Linear Regression Interview Questions Aspect Biased Estimate Unbiased Estimate DefinitionAn estimate that is systematically oﬀ-target from the true valueAn estimate that is, on average, equal to the true value CauseResults from a flawed modeling or sampling procedure that consistently skews the estimate in one directionResults from a modeling or sampling procedure that does not systematically favor any particular direction Impact on inferenceCan lead to incorrect conclusions or overconfidence in resultsMore likely to lead to accurate conclusions and better decision- making ExampleIn a study on the eﬀect of hours of study on exam scores, a biased estimate may underestimate the true relationship between hours of study and exam scores due to an inadequate sample size or the omission of i ttAn unbiased estimate would accurately reflect the true relationship between hours of study and exam scores Linear Regression Interview Questions"
"13. How do you measure the strength of a linear relationship between two variables? One way to measure the strength of a linear relationship between two variables is by calculating the correlation coeﬀicient, which is a measure of the strength and direction of the linear relationship between the two variables. The correlation coeﬀicient ranges from -1 to 1, with -1 indicating a perfect negative linear relationship, 0 indicating no linear relationship, and 1 indicating a perfect positive linear relationship. A higher absolute value of the correlation coeﬀicient indicates a stronger linear relationship between the two variables."
"14. What is the diﬀerence between a population regression line and a sample regression line? A population regression line is a mathematical model that describes the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables in a population. It is based on the entire population and is used to make predictions about the population as a whole. A sample regression line, on the other hand, is a mathematical model that describes the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables in a sample. It is based on a subset of the population and is used to make predictions about the sample and to estimate the population regression line. Linear Regression Interview Questions Aspect Population Regression Line Sample Regression Definition The regression line describes the relationship between the independent variable and the dependent variable in the entire population.The regression line estimated from a sample of the population.

Linear Regression Interview Questions"
"15. What is the diﬀerence between linear regression and non- linear regression? Linear regression is a statistical method that uses a linear equation to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. The linear equation is of the form y = mx + b, where y is the dependent variable, x is the independent variable, m is the slope of the line, and b is the y-intercept. In linear regression, the relationship between the variables is assumed to be linear, meaning that the dependent variable changes at a constant rate with respect to the independent variable. Non-linear regression, on the other hand, is a statistical method that uses a non- linear equation to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. The non-linear equation can be of many diﬀerent forms, including polynomial equations, exponential equations, and logarithmic equations. In non-linear regression, the relationship between the variables is not assumed to be linear, meaning that the dependent variable can change at diﬀerent rates with respect to the independent variable. Linear Regression Interview Questions Aspect Linear Regression Non-Linear Regression Definition A statistical method that models the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables as a linear function.A statistical method that models the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables as a non-linear function. Function form The relationship between the variables is assumed to be linear, with the dependent variable being a linear combination of the independent variables.The relationship between the variables can take any non-linear form, such as polynomial, exponential, logarithmic, or sigmoid. Equation y = β0 + β1x1 + β2x2 + ... + βnxn + εy = f(x1, x2, ..., xn, β1, β2, ..., βk) + ε, where f is a non-linear function and β1, β2, ..., βk are the parameters of the function. Linear Regression Interview Questions"
16. What are the common techniques used to improve the accuracy of a linear regression model? Feature selection: selecting the most relevant features for the model to improve its predictive power. Feature scaling: scaling the features to a similar range to prevent bias towards certain features. Regularization: adding a penalty term to the model to prevent overfitting and improve generalization. Cross-validation: dividing the data into multiple partitions and using a diﬀerent partition for validation in each iteration to avoid overfitting. Ensemble methods: combining multiple models to improve the overall accuracy and reduce variance.
"17. What is a residual in linear regression and how is it used in model evaluation? Linear Regression Interview Questions In linear regression, a residual is the diﬀerence between the predicted value of the dependent variable (based on the model) and the actual observed value. It is used to evaluate the performance of the model by measuring how well the model fits the data. If the residuals are small and evenly distributed around the mean, it indicates that the model is a good fit for the data. However, if the residuals are large and not evenly distributed, it indicates that the model may not be a good fit for the data and may need to be improved or refined."
"18. What is the diﬀerence between a parametric and non- parametric regression model? A parametric regression model is a model that assumes a specific functional form for the relationship between the dependent and independent variables, and estimates the model parameters based on the data. This means that the model has a fixed number of parameters, and the model structure is predetermined. On the other hand, a non-parametric regression model does not assume any specific functional form for the relationship between the dependent and independent variables, and instead estimates the relationship using a flexible, data-driven approach. This means that the model does not have a fixed number of parameters, and the model structure is not predetermined. Instead, the model is determined based on the data itself. Linear Regression Interview Questions Aspect Parametric Regression Nonparametric Regressi Definition A statistical method that models the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables as a specific functional form with fixed parameters.A statistical method that models the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables without making any assumptions about the functional form or fixed parameters. Assumptions Assumes a specific functional form of the relationship between the dependent and independent variables, such as linear or polynomial, and assumes that the residuals are normally distributed with constant variance.Does not assume any specific functional form o the relationship between the dependent and independent variables, an makes fewer assumption about the distribution of the residuals. Flexibility Less flexible, as it is limited to the specific functional form assumed.More flexible, as it does n assume any specific functional form. Parameter estimationEstimates the parameters of the specific functional form using maximum likelihood or least squares method.Estimates the relationshi between the variables usi a kernel function or other non-parametric methods which do not involve estimating specific parameters. Linear Regression Interview Questions"
19. What are the assumptions of the ordinary least squares method for linear regression? The ordinary least squares method for linear regression makes several assumptions about the data and the relationship between the variables. These assumptions include: The dependent variable is continuous and normally distributed. The independent variables are linearly related to the dependent variable. There is no multicollinearity among the independent variables. The errors are independent and identically distributed. The errors have a mean of zero. These assumptions help to ensure that the resulting model is reliable and accurately describes the relationship between the variables. It's important to test these assumptions and ensure that they are met before using the model for prediction. Linear Regression Advanced Interview Questions
"20. How do you determine the significance of a predictor variable in a linear regression model? Linear Regression Interview Questions One way to determine the significance of a predictor variable in a linear regression model is to evaluate its p-value. If the p-value is below a certain threshold, typically 0.05, it indicates that the predictor variable has a statistically significant relationship with the response variable. Another way to determine the significance of a predictor variable is to evaluate its coeﬀicient in the regression equation. A large magnitude of the coeﬀicient indicates a strong relationship between the predictor and response variables. Additionally, comparing the coeﬀicient of the predictor variable with the coeﬀicients of other predictor variables in the model can provide insight into its relative importance in predicting the response variable."
"21. What is the role of a dummy variable in linear regression analysis? A dummy variable in linear regression analysis is used as a substitute for an unobserved or non-measured categorical variable. It is used to represent the presence or absence of a specific category in the data set. Linear Regression Interview Questions For example, in a study of the relationship between income and education level, a dummy variable could be used to represent the presence or absence of a college degree. This allows the model to diﬀerentiate between individuals with and without a college degree, and account for any potential eﬀects of this variable on the outcome of the analysis."
"22. What is heteroscedasticity? Heteroscedasticity is a statistical term that refers to the unequal variance of the error terms (or residuals) in a regression model. In a regression model, the residuals represent the diﬀerence between the observed values and the predicted values of the dependent variable. When heteroscedasticity occurs: The variance of the error terms is not constant across the range of the independent variables. Error terms tend to be larger for some values of the independent variables than for others. This can result in biased and inconsistent estimates of the regression coeﬀicients and standard errors, which can aﬀect the accuracy of the statistical inferences and predictions made from the model. Linear Regression Interview Questions Heteroscedasticity can be caused by a number of factors, including: Outliers Omitted variables Measurement errors Nonlinear relationships between the variables It is important to detect and correct for heteroscedasticity in a regression model to ensure the validity and reliability of the statistical results. This can be done by: Using methods such as weighted least squares, robust regression, or transforming the variables. Graphical methods, such as residual plots, can also be used to detect heteroscedasticity."
"23. What is the diﬀerence between a categorical and continuous variable in linear regression? A categorical variable is a variable that can take on one of a limited number of values, such as ""male"" or ""female"". A continuous variable is a variable that can take on any value within a certain range, such as ""height"" or ""weight"". In linear regression, a categorical variable is typically represented by a dummy variable, which is a binary variable that indicates the presence or absence of a particular category. Continuous variables, on the other hand, are typically represented by their actual values. Linear Regression Interview Questions Aspect Categorical Variable Continuous Variable Definition A variable can take on a limited number of categories or values.A variable can take on any value within a range or interval. Examples Gender, race, occupation, and education level.Age, income, height, weight, temperature. Coding Typically coded as binary (0 or 1) or dummy variables to represent each category.No coding is necessary, as values are already numerical. Modeling Requires specific techniques, such as logistic regression or ANOVA, to model the relationship between the dependent and independent variables.Can be modeled using simple linear regression or multiple linear regression. Interpretation Coeﬀicients represent the change in the dependent variable for each category compared to the reference category.Coeﬀicients represent the change in the dependent variable for each unit change in the independent variable. Linear Regression Interview Questions"
"24. What is the impact of correlated predictor variables on linear regression analysis? The presence of correlated predictor variables in a linear regression analysis can lead to a variety of issues, including:"
"1. Multicollinearity: This is when two or more predictor variables are highly correlated with each other. This can lead to unstable and inconsistent coeﬀicients, making it diﬀicult to accurately interpret the results of the regression."
"2. Singularity: This is when the predictor variables are perfectly correlated, resulting in a matrix that is not invertible. This can cause the regression to fail to converge or to produce nonsensical results."
"3. Overfitting: If a model includes multiple correlated predictor variables, it may be more prone to overfitting, where the model is too specific to the training data and does not generalize well to new data. Linear Regression Interview Questions Overall, the presence of correlated predictor variables can lead to inaccurate and unreliable results from linear regression analysis. It is important to carefully consider the relationships between predictor variables and to address any multicollinearity issues before conducting the regression."
"25. How do you evaluate the goodness of fit of a linear regression model? There are a few diﬀerent ways to evaluate the goodness of fit of a linear regression model. One of the most common is to use the coeﬀicient of determination, also known as the R-squared value. This is a measure of how well the regression line fits the data, with a value of 1 indicating a perfect fit and a value of 0 indicating that the model does not explain any of the variances in the data. Another common way to evaluate the goodness of fit is to use the root mean squared error (RMSE), which is a measure of the diﬀerence between the predicted values and the actual values in the data. A smaller RMSE indicates a better fit."
"26. What is the role of a regression coeﬀicient in linear regression analysis? Linear Regression Interview Questions A regression coeﬀicient in linear regression analysis represents the strength and direction of the relationship between a predictor variable and the response variable. It indicates the average change in the response variable for every unit change in the predictor variable while controlling for the eﬀects of other predictor variables in the model. The sign of the coeﬀicient indicates the direction of the relationship (positive or negative), and the magnitude of the coeﬀicient indicates the strength of the relationship."
"27. What is a prediction interval in linear regression and how is it used? A prediction interval in linear regression is a range of values that is likely to contain the value of a new observation given a set of predictor variables. It is used to provide a more accurate estimate of the uncertainty of a predicted value, as it takes into account both the uncertainty of the regression model and the error associated with a new observation. This can be useful for making more informed predictions and decision-making based on those predictions."
28. How to find RMSE and MSE? RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and MSE (Mean Squared Error) are both measures of the diﬀerence between predicted and actual values in a regression model. To calculate MSE:
1. Take the diﬀerence between each predicted value and its corresponding actual value.
2. Square each of these diﬀerences.
3. Add up all of the squared diﬀerences.
"4. Divide the sum by the total number of observations in the data set. The formula for MSE is: MSE = (1/n) * ∑(Yi - Ŷi)² where n is the total number of observations, Yi is the actual value of the dependent variable, and Ŷi is the predicted value of the dependent variable. Linear Regression Interview Questions To calculate RMSE, take the square root of the MSE value: RMSE = sqrt(MSE) RMSE and MSE provide a measure of how far the predicted values are from the actual values in a regression model. A smaller RMSE or MSE indicates that the model is better at predicting the dependent variable."
"29. How do you test for autocorrelation in a linear regression model? A linear regression model with a positive correlation indicates that as the value of one variable increases, the value of the other variable also increases. In contrast, a linear regression model with a negative correlation indicates that as the value of one variable increases, the value of the other variable decreases."
30. What are the common challenges faced when building a linear regression model? There are several common challenges that can arise when building a linear regression model. Some of these include: Linear Regression Interview Questions
"1. Poor quality data: Linear regression relies on having high-quality data to make accurate predictions. If the data is noisy, missing, or has outliers, the model may not be able to make accurate predictions."
"2. Nonlinear relationships: Linear regression is based on the assumption that the relationship between the dependent and independent variables is linear. If the relationship is nonlinear, the model may not be able to accurately capture it."
3. Multicollinearity: Multicollinearity occurs when there are strong correlations between two or more independent variables in the dataset. This can cause the model to be less stable and make it diﬀicult to interpret the results.
"4. Overfitting: Overfitting occurs when a model is overly complex and is able to fit the noise in the data, rather than the underlying relationship. This can cause the model to perform well on the training data but poorly on new, unseen data."
"5. Underfitting: Underfitting occurs when a model is too simple to capture the underlying relationship in the data. This can cause the model to perform poorly on both the training and test data. Overall, building a successful linear regression model requires careful preprocessing of the data, selecting appropriate features, and choosing the right model complexity."
"31. Can you explain the concept of collinearity and how it aﬀects a linear regression model? Collinearity refers to the relationship between two or more predictor variables in a linear regression model. It occurs when the predictor variables are highly correlated with each other, meaning that they are measuring the same underlying concept or phenomenon. Linear Regression Interview Questions Collinearity can aﬀect the results of a linear regression model in several ways. Firstly, it can make the coeﬀicients of the predictor variables unstable and diﬀicult to interpret. This is because collinearity can cause the coeﬀicients to vary greatly depending on the specific data that is used in the model. Secondly, collinearity can lead to problems with model selection. In particular, it can cause the model to overfit the data, meaning that it will perform well on the training data but not generalize well to new data. This can lead to a model that is not useful for making predictions or making decisions. Thirdly, collinearity can also aﬀect the statistical significance of the predictor variables. If the predictor variables are highly correlated with each other, it can be diﬀicult to determine which variables are truly contributing to the model and which are just noise."
32. How do you choose the right variables for a linear regression model? The variables chosen for a linear regression model should be carefully selected based on the following factors: Linear Regression Interview Questions
1. Relevance: The variables should be relevant to the problem at hand and should have a clear relationship with the dependent variable.
2. Correlation: The variables should be correlated with the dependent variable. This can be determined by calculating the correlation coeﬀicient between the variables and the dependent variable.
"3. Multicollinearity: The variables should not be highly correlated with each other, as this can lead to problems with the model's ability to accurately predict the dependent variable."
"4. Interpretability: The variables should be easy to interpret and explain, as this will make the model more understandable and easier to use."
"5. Data availability: The data for the chosen variables should be readily available and should be of good quality. Once these factors have been considered, the most appropriate variables can be selected for the linear regression model."
"33. What is the role of regularization techniques in preventing overfitting in linear regression? Regularization techniques, such as L1 and L2 regularization, are used in linear regression to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the cost function. This penalty term encourages the model to prioritize simplicity and reduces the complexity of the model, thereby limiting the amount of overfitting. Regularization techniques help to strike a balance between model complexity and model performance, allowing the model to generalize well to unseen data."
"34. Can you explain the concept of overfitting in linear regression? Linear Regression Interview Questions Overfitting in linear regression occurs when a model is trained on a limited amount of data and becomes too complex, resulting in poor performance when making predictions on unseen data. This happens because the model has learned to fit the noise or random fluctuations in the training data, rather than the underlying patterns and trends. As a result, the model is not able to generalize well to new data and may produce inaccurate or unreliable predictions. Overfitting can be avoided by using regularization techniques, such as introducing penalty terms to the objective function or using cross-validation to assess the model's performance."
35. What are the limitations of linear regression?
1. Linear regression is limited to modelling linear relationships between dependent and independent variables. It cannot model non-linear relationships.
"2. Linear regression assumes a linear relationship between the dependent and independent variables. If this assumption is violated, the model may not be accurate."
"3. Linear regression assumes that the residuals are normally distributed and homoscedastic (i.e. the variance of the residuals is constant). If these assumptions are violated, the model may not be accurate."
"4. Linear regression assumes that there is no multicollinearity (i.e. high correlations) among the independent variables. If there is multicollinearity, the model may be unstable and the coeﬀicients may be diﬀicult to interpret."
"5. Linear regression may not be able to accurately model complex relationships between the dependent and independent variables, such as interactions or non- linear eﬀects. In these cases, more advanced regression techniques may be needed."
36. What are the possible ways of improving the accuracy of a linear regression model? There are several ways to improve the accuracy of a linear regression model: Linear Regression Interview Questions
1. Increase the amount of data: Adding more data to the model can help to reduce the impact of outliers and increase the accuracy of the estimates.
2. Feature selection: Careful selection of the relevant features to include in the model can improve its accuracy. This involves identifying the features that have the strongest relationship with the dependent variable.
"3. Data preprocessing: Preprocessing the data can involve handling missing values, dealing with outliers, and scaling the data. This can improve the accuracy of the model and reduce the risk of overfitting."
"4. Regularization: Regularization techniques like Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, and Elastic Net Regression can help to reduce overfitting and improve the accuracy of the model."
"5. Non-linear transformations: Transforming the independent variables using non-linear functions such as logarithmic, exponential, or polynomial transformations can improve the accuracy of the model."
6. Cross-validation: Cross-validation can help to assess the performance of the model and fine-tune its parameters to improve accuracy.
"7. Ensemble models: Combining the predictions of multiple regression models, such as Random Forest Regression or Gradient Boosting Regression, can help to improve the accuracy of the model. By using these techniques, it is possible to improve the accuracy of a linear regression model and make better predictions."
"37. Can you explain the concept of bias-variance tradeoﬀ in linear regression? The bias-variance tradeoﬀ in linear regression refers to the balancing act between underfitting (high bias) and overfitting (high variance) in a model. Underfitting occurs when the model is too simplistic and does not capture the underlying pattern in the data, leading to poor performance on both the training and testing sets. This results in high bias, as the model consistently makes the same types of errors. Linear Regression Interview Questions On the other hand, overfitting occurs when the model is too complex and captures noise or randomness in the training data, leading to good performance on the training set but poor performance on the testing set. This results in high variance, as the model's predictions can vary greatly depending on the specific training data used. The bias-variance tradeoﬀ suggests that there is a sweet spot between underfitting and overfitting, where the model has low bias and low variance and can eﬀectively generalize to unseen data. In linear regression, this can be achieved by finding the optimal model complexity (e.g. the number of features or the regularization strength) through techniques such as cross-validation."
"38. Can you explain the diﬀerence between a linear regression model that assumes homoscedasticity and one that assumes heteroscedasticity? A linear regression model with homoscedasticity assumes that the variance of the error terms is constant across all values of the predictor variable, while a model with heteroscedasticity assumes that the variance of the error terms is not constant and may vary across diﬀerent values of the predictor variable. This can impact the reliability and accuracy of the regression model's predictions."
"39. What is the diﬀerence between a linear regression model with a linear relationship and one with a non-linear relationship? A linear regression model with a linear relationship is a model where the dependent variable is linearly related to the independent variable(s), meaning that the relationship between the two variables can be described by a straight line. This type of model is o"
"40. What is the curse of dimensionality? Can you give an example? The curse of dimensionality refers to the phenomenon where the complexity of a problem increases exponentially with the number of dimensions or variables involved. In other words, as the number of variables in a problem increases, the amount of data required to obtain accurate and reliable results increase exponentially. For example, consider a dataset with only two variables, where we want to create a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between the variables. We can easily plot the data points on a two-dimensional plane and visually inspect the relationship between the variables. However, if we add a third variable, we cannot plot the data on a two-dimensional plane anymore. We would need to use a three-dimensional plot, which is more diﬀicult to visualize and interpret. If we add more variables, the problem becomes even more complex, making it more diﬀicult to understand the relationships between the variables. The curse of dimensionality can also aﬀect the performance of machine learning models. As the number of variables increases, the number of possible combinations of variables that a model needs to consider also increases, which can make the model more computationally expensive and time-consuming to train. To overcome the curse of dimensionality, it is important to carefully select the variables that are most relevant to the problem and to use techniques such as feature selection and dimensionality reduction to reduce the number of variables in the model."
"41. What is the diﬀerence between correlation and regression? Linear Regression Interview Questions Correlation measures the strength and direction of the relationship between two variables, while regression examines how changes in the independent variable aﬀect changes in the dependent variable. Linear Regression Interview Questions Correlation Regression Measures the strength and direction of the relationship between two variables.Examines the relationship between an independent variable and a dependent variable. Measures the degree of association between two variables.Examines how changes in the independent variable aﬀect changes in the dependent variable. Does not imply causation between the two variables.Can be used to test hypotheses about causality between the independent and dependent variables. Can be used with any two quantitative variables.Requires at least one independent variable and one dependent variable. Only produces a correlation coeﬀicient, which is a single number that represents the degree of association between the two variables.Produces an equation that represents the relationship between the independent and dependent variable. Correlation analysis can be done by using scatter plots, correlation matrices or correlation coeﬀicients.Regression analysis can be done by using techniques such as ordinary least squares, logistic regression, or Poisson regression. Linear Regression Interview Questions"
"42. What is the main problem with using a single regression line? The main problem with using a single regression line to model the relationship between two variables is that it assumes a constant relationship between the variables for all levels of the independent variable. This can be a problem when there is a non-linear relationship between the variables, or when there are multiple subpopulations with diﬀerent relationships between the variables. In these cases, a single regression line may not accurately capture the relationship between the variables and can result in biased or inaccurate predictions. To address this problem, multiple regression models or non-linear regression models can be used to better capture the underlying relationship between the variables."
"43. What does locally weighted regression results depend on? Locally weighted regression (LWR), also known as LOESS (locally estimated scatterplot smoothing), is a non-parametric regression method that is used to model the relationship between two variables. Unlike traditional linear regression models, LWR does not assume a specific functional form for the relationship between the variables. Instead, it fits a separate regression line for each observation based on a weighted average of the neighbouring observations. The results of LWR depend on several factors, including: Linear Regression Interview Questions"
"1. The choice of smoothing parameter (also known as the bandwidth), determines the number of neighbouring observations used to fit each local regression line. A larger bandwidth will result in a smoother curve, while a smaller bandwidth will result in a more flexible curve that more closely tracks the data."
"2. The choice of the weighting function determines the relative influence of each neighbouring observation on the local regression line. The most common weighting function is the Gaussian kernel, which assigns higher weights to observations that are closer to the point being predicted."
"3. The choice of the degree of the polynomial used to fit the local regression lines. LWR can use polynomial models of any degree, from linear to higher-order polynomials."
"4. The choice of the distance metric is used to measure the similarity between observations. The most common distance metric is the Euclidean distance, which measures the straight-line distance between two points in a Cartesian coordinate system. Overall, the results of LWR depend on the choice of several parameters, which can be tuned to optimize the trade-oﬀ between bias and variance in the model. LWR is a powerful and flexible regression method that can be used to model a wide range of relationships between variables, but it requires careful parameter selection and may be computationally intensive for large datasets."
"44. Which of the following is the simplest error detection method? The simplest error detection method is the parity check. In this method, an extra bit called a parity bit is added to the message, which is set to 0 or 1 to ensure that the total number of 1's in the message (including the parity bit) is even or odd, depending on the type of parity used. When the message is received, the receiver counts the number of 1's in the message (including the parity bit) and checks whether it is even or odd, depending on the type of parity used. Linear Regression Interview Questions If the parity check fails, it means that the message has been corrupted during transmission, and the receiver requests the sender to retransmit the message. Parity check is simple and eﬀicient but has limited error-detection capability and cannot correct errors. More sophisticated error-detection and correction methods, such as cyclic redundancy check (CRC) and Hamming codes, can detect and correct a wider range of errors."
"45. If you have only one independent variable, how many coeﬀicients will you require to estimate in a simple linear regression model? In a simple linear regression model with only one independent variable, we need to estimate two coeﬀicients: the intercept (or constant term) and the slope (or regression coeﬀicient) of the independent variable. In a simple linear regression model, there is only one independent variable and one dependent variable. The goal of the model is to estimate the relationship between the two variables using a straight line, which is represented by the equation: y = b0 + b1*x where y is the dependent variable, x is the independent variable, b0 is the y-intercept (the value of y when x is zero), and b1 is the slope of the line (the change in y for a one-unit change in x). To estimate the values of the coeﬀicients b0 and b1, we use the method of least squares, which involves minimizing the sum of the squared diﬀerences between the observed values of y and the predicted values of y based on the model. Since there is only one independent variable in a simple linear regression model, we only need to estimate two coeﬀicients: b0 and b1. These coeﬀicients represent the intercept and slope of the line, respectively, and they determine the shape and position of the line that best fits the data. Linear Regression Interview Questions Once we have estimated the values of b0 and b1, we can use the equation to predict the value of y for any given value of x. The accuracy of these predictions depends on how well the model fits the data and how much variability there is in the relationship between x and y."
46. What is the performance of the model a
"1. Increase in model complexity: The addition of a non-important feature can increase the number of parameters in the model and make it more complex. This can lead to overfitting, where the model fits the training data too closely and performs poorly on new data."
2. Decrease in model interpretability: The addition of a non-important feature can make it more diﬀicult to interpret the coeﬀicients of the model. This can make it harder to understand the relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable.
"3. Increase in computational time: The addition of a non-important feature can increase the computational time required to fit the model, especially if the feature is highly correlated with other features in the model. This can make the model less eﬀicient and more time-consuming to train."
"4. No eﬀect on model performance: In some cases, adding a non-important feature may have no eﬀect on the model's performance. This is because the feature does not contribute any useful information to the model, and the coeﬀicients associated with the feature are close to zero. Therefore, it is important to carefully consider the relevance of adding a new feature to a linear regression model. The feature should be carefully evaluated to ensure that it contributes to the prediction of the dependent variable and does not negatively impact the model's performance. It is also important to consider the potential trade- oﬀs in terms of model complexity, interpretability, and computational eﬀiciency. In general, it is recommended to use feature selection techniques to identify the most important features and remove any non-important features before fitting the model. Linear Regression Interview Questions"
"47. Linearity in regression corresponds to what ? In linear regression, linearity corresponds to the relationship between the independent variable(s) and the dependent variable being linear. This means that the change in the dependent variable is proportional to the change in the independent variable(s), and the relationship can be represented by a straight line. In other words, the relationship between the independent variable(s) and the dependent variable is not curved or nonlinear. It is important to note that linearity is an assumption of linear regression, and violating this assumption can lead to biased or unreliable estimates of the coeﬀicients and predictions. Therefore, it is important to check for linearity by examining the scatter plot of the data and ensuring that the relationship between the independent variable(s) and the dependent variable appears to be linear. If the relationship is non-linear, transformations of the data or the use of non-linear regression methods may be necessary."
"48. Which of the following plots is best suited to test the linear relationship of independent and dependent continuous variables? A scatter plot is best suited to test the linear relationship of independent and dependent continuous variables. A scatter plot is a graph in which the values of two variables are plotted along two axes, with the independent variable plotted on the x- axis and the dependent variable plotted on the y-axis. By examining the pattern of points on the scatter plot, it is possible to determine whether there is a linear relationship between the two variables. If there is a strong linear relationship, the points on the scatter plot will tend to fall along a straight line. The scatter plot is the most suitable plot to test the linear relationship between independent and dependent continuous variables. In a scatter plot, the values of the independent variable are plotted on the x-axis, while the values of the dependent variable are plotted on the y-axis. Each data point represents the values of both variables for a single observation. Linear Regression Interview Questions By visualizing the data in a scatter plot, you can examine the relationship between the variables and assess whether it is linear or nonlinear. A linear relationship between two variables means that as one variable increases, the other variable increases or decreases proportionally. In a scatter plot, a linear relationship appears as a pattern of points that roughly follow a straight line. If the scatter plot shows a linear relationship between the variables, you can fit a linear regression model to the data to estimate the equation of the line that best describes the relationship. The slope of the line represents the change in the dependent variable for a unit change in the independent variable. The intercept represents the value of the dependent variable when the independent variable is equal to zero. It is important to note that while a scatter plot can indicate the presence of a linear relationship between two variables, it cannot prove causation. Other factors may also be influencing the relationship, and it is necessary to consider other information and use appropriate statistical methods to establish causality."
"49. What is the primary diﬀerence between R squared and adjusted R squared? R-squared (R2) and adjusted R-squared (R2_adj) are both statistical measures used to evaluate the goodness of fit of a linear regression model. They both provide an indication of how well the model fits the data, but there are some diﬀerences between the two measures. The primary diﬀerence between R-squared and adjusted R-squared is that adjusted R- squared takes into account the number of independent variables in the model, whereas R-squared does not. This means that adjusted R-squared is a more accurate measure of the goodness of fit of a model that includes multiple independent variables. Here is a table summarizing the key diﬀerences between R-squared and adjusted R- squared: Linear Regression Interview Questions Measure Definition Calculation R-squared The proportion of variance in the dependent variable is explained by the independent variable(s) in the model.1 - (SSres/SStot), where SSres is the sum of squared residuals and SStot is the total sum of squares. Adjusted R- squaredThe proportion of variance in the dependent variable is explained by the independent variable(s) in the model, adjusted for the number of independent variables in the model.1 - [(SSres/(n-k- 1))/(SStot/(n-1))], where SSres is the sum of squared residuals, SStot is the total sum of squares, n is the sample size, and k is the number of independent variables in the model. Range 0 to 1 0 to 1 Linear Regression Interview Questions R-squared is useful for evaluating the goodness of fit of a simple linear regression model with one independent variable, while adjusted R-squared is more appropriate for evaluating the goodness of fit of a multiple linear regression model with multiple independent variables. While both measures provide an indication of how well the model fits the data, adjusted R-squared is a more accurate measure in situations where there are multiple independent variables with potentially diﬀerent levels of importance."
50. What is the importance of the F-test in a linear model? The F-test is a statistical significance test that is commonly used in linear regression models to assess the overall significance of the model or a subset of variables. The F- test is based on the ratio of two variances - the explained variance and the unexplained variance - and is used to test the null hypothesis that all the regression coeﬀicients in the model are zero. The F-test is important in a linear model for the following reasons: Linear Regression Interview Questions
1. Overall model significance: The F-test is used to determine whether the linear regression model as a whole is statistically significant or not. A statistically significant F-test indicates that at least one of the predictor variables is significantly related to the response variable.
2. Model comparison: The F-test can be used to compare two or more linear regression models to determine which one is better. The model with the higher F-value is considered to be a better fit to the data.
3. Variable significance: The F-test can be used to determine the significance of individual predictor variables in the model. A high F-value for a particular variable indicates that it is a significant predictor of the response variable.
4. Variable selection: The F-test can be used in variable selection procedures to determine which predictor variables should be included in the model. Variables with low F-values may be removed from the model as they are not significant predictors of the response variable.
5. Assumption testing: The F-test is used to test the assumption of homoscedasticity (equal variances of residuals) in a linear regression model. A non-significant F-test indicates that the assumption of homoscedasticity is valid.
"6. Inference testing: The F-test is used to test the null hypothesis that all the regression coeﬀicients in the model are zero. If the F-test is statistically significant, it suggests that at least one of the regression coeﬀicients is not equal to zero and that there is a relationship between the predictor variables and the response variable."
"7. Quality of predictions: The F-test can be used to determine the quality of predictions made by the linear regression model. A high F-value indicates that the model is able to explain a large proportion of the variation in the response variable, which in turn suggests that the model is able to make accurate predictions."
"8. Interpretation of regression coeﬀicients: The F-test can be used to interpret the regression coeﬀicients in the model. If the F-test is statistically significant, it suggests that the regression coeﬀicients are not equal to zero and can be used to estimate the magnitude and direction of the relationship between the predictor variables and the response variable."
"9. Confidence intervals: The F-test can be used to calculate confidence intervals for the regression coeﬀicients in the model. The width of the confidence interval is inversely proportional to the F-value, meaning that a higher F-value results in a narrower confidence interval and a more precise estimate of the regression coeﬀicient. 10Validation:TheFtestcanbeusedtovalidatethelinearregressionmodelby Linear Regression Interview Questions"
"51. Explain the Gradient Descent algorithm with respect to linear regression? Gradient Descent is an iterative optimization algorithm used to minimize the cost function of a model. In linear regression, Gradient Descent is used to find the values of the model’s parameters that minimize the sum of the squared errors between the predicted values and the actual values. Here’s a step-by-step explanation of how Gradient Descent works in the context of linear regression:"
1. Initialize the coeﬀicients: The algorithm starts by initializing the coeﬀicients (also called weights) of the linear regression model to some random values.
"2. Calculate the cost function: The cost function measures how well the model fits the training data. In linear regression, the cost function is the sum of the squared diﬀerences between the predicted and actual values."
3. Calculate the gradient: The gradient is a vector of partial derivatives of the cost function with respect to each coeﬀicient. The gradient tells us the direction and magnitude of the steepest increase in the cost function.
4. Update the coeﬀicients: The coeﬀicients are updated using the gradient and a learning rate (a small positive number). The learning rate controls the step size taken in the direction of the negative gradient to find the minimum cost.
"5. Repeat steps 2-4 until convergence: The algorithm repeatedly calculates the cost function and updates the coeﬀicients until the cost function reaches a minimum, indicating that the algorithm has converged to the optimal values of the coeﬀicients. The Gradient Descent algorithm is an iterative process that takes many steps to reach the optimal values of the coeﬀicients. The learning rate is a hyperparameter that controls the step size taken in each iteration, and it needs to be chosen carefully to avoid overshooting the minimum. Linear Regression Interview Questions Gradient Descent is a powerful algorithm for minimizing the cost function of a linear regression model. It is an iterative process that repeatedly updates the coeﬀicients of the model using the gradient of the cost function and a learning rate. By minimizing the cost function, Gradient Descent helps us find the optimal values of the coeﬀicients that best fit the training data."
"52. For a linear regression model, how do we interpret a Q-Q plot? A Q-Q (quantile-quantile) plot is a graphical method used to assess the normality assumption of the residuals in a linear regression model. It compares the distribution of the residuals to a theoretical normal distribution. To interpret a Q-Q plot for a linear regression model, we can follow these steps:"
"1. First, we fit the linear regression model to the data and obtain the residuals."
"2. Next, we create a Q-Q plot of the residuals. The Q-Q plot displays the quantiles of the residuals on the y-axis and the expected quantiles of a normal distribution on the x-axis."
"3. If the residuals are normally distributed, the points on the Q-Q plot will fall approximately along a straight line. Deviations from the straight line suggest that the residuals are not normally distributed."
"4. If the points on the Q-Q plot deviate from the straight line in the middle or at the tails of the distribution, it may indicate skewness or heavy-tailedness in the residuals."
"5. We can also look for outliers on the Q-Q plot. Outliers may appear as points that are far away from the straight line. A Q-Q plot is a visual tool that can help us assess whether the residuals in a linear regression model are normally distributed. Deviations from the expected straight line in the Q-Q plot may indicate non-normality, skewness, or outliers in the residuals."
"Scrum Master Interview Questions Scrum Teams, as well as their related responsibilities, events, artifacts, and rules, make up the Scrum framework. Each component of the framework serves a distinct purpose and is critical to the success and adoption of Scrum. Scrum's rules link events, roles, and objects together, regulating their relationships and interactions. In the following section, we will see what are the most commonly asked Scrum Master Interview Questions and Answers for Freshers and Experienced candidates.

"1. What are the diﬀerent roles in Scrum? Following are the diﬀerent roles in Scrum:- Scrum Master Interview Questions Product Owner: The product owner is in charge of enhancing ROI by determining product features, prioritizing these items into a list, determining what should be prioritized for the next sprint, and much more. These are re- prioritized and modified on a regular basis. Scrum Master: This person assists the team in learning how to use Scrum to maximize business value. The scrum master removes roadblocks, keeps the team focused, and helps the team embrace agile methods. Scrum Team: A Scrum Team is a group of people who work together to guarantee that the stakeholders' needs are met."

"3. What do you mean by Sprint in Scrum? Scrum Master Interview Questions A Sprint is at the heart of Scrum. It is a two-week or one-month period in which a potentially releasable product increment is generated. Following the conclusion of the preceding Sprint, a new Sprint begins. It breaks down large, diﬀicult undertakings into manageable chunks. It helps teams provide high-quality work faster and more frequently, making projects easier to manage. Sprints provide them with more flexibility in adapting to changes. Sprint planning, daily scrums, development work, Sprint review, and sprint retrospective are all part of a sprint. The work to be done in the Sprint is planned collectively by the Scrum Team during Sprint planning. The Daily Scrum Meeting is a 15-minute timed event in which the Scrum Team synchronizes eﬀorts and creates a strategy for the following day. At the end of each Sprint, a Sprint Review is held to review the Increment and, if necessary, make modifications to the Product Backlog. A"
"4. What are the five Scrum values? Following are the five Scrum values: Scrum Master Interview Questions Scrum Master Interview Questions Commitment: Scrum teams must be able to function as a team to accomplish a common goal. This entails putting faith in one another to complete their jobs and deliver to the best of their abilities. It will only occur if each team member is completely dedicated to the project and the team. Scrum masters and team leaders can aid commitment by facilitating good sprint preparation and shielding teams from mid-sprint scope changes and undue product owner pressure. Focus: Each member of the team must remain focused on the work at hand as well as how it aﬀects the sprint goal in order to get the most out of each sprint. Scrum masters might limit the number of tasks or priorities assigned to each team member throughout sprints to help them stay focused. Individuals can also stay focused on their assigned work by encouraging full team participation in daily Scrum meetings. Openness: Each member of the team must be absolutely truthful about their personal progress in order for the Scrum team to accomplish the maximum progress in the quickest period possible. The daily Scrum meeting's goal is to identify and solve problems. That won't happen if team members aren't honest about any problems or hurdles they're facing. Team members must also be willing to collaborate with one another and see each other as vital contributors to the project's success. Being upfront with their teams is one of the finest methods for Scrum masters to foster openness. Giving honest feedback at daily Scrum meetings is not only crucial for making required adjustments, but it will also inspire team members to be honest and open in return. Respect: Respect in a Scrum team implies understanding that no single individual or their contribution is more valuable than another. Respect also entails putting your faith in your coworkers to complete their jobs, listening to and considering their suggestions, and praising their achievements. Scrum masters may assist their teams to develop regard for each other by exhibiting respect for the product owner, stakeholders, and team members. Courage: Scrum teams must have the guts to be genuine, upfront, and honest about the project's progress and any bottlenecks they encounter, both with themselves and with stakeholders. Members of the team must also have the bravery to seek assistance when needed, attempt new techniques or procedures that they are unfamiliar with, and respectfully disagree and engage in open debate. Scrum masters, like respect, can first and foremost promote courage by diliitT id id itdjt t thS M t Scrum Master Interview Questions"
"5. What are the three pillars of Scrum? Following are the three pillars of Scrum: Transparency: Those accountable for the outcome must be able to see important components of the process. Transparency necessitates that those elements be defined by a uniform standard so that viewers may comprehend what they are seeing. For example, all participants must speak the same language when referring to the process, and those performing the job and those inspecting the resulting increment must have the same concept of ""done."" Inspection: To spot undesired deviations, Scrum users must examine Scrum artifacts and progress toward a Sprint Goal on a regular basis. Their inspections should not be so frequent that they become a hindrance to their work. Inspections are most eﬀective when performed diligently at the point of work by skilled inspectors. Adaption: If an inspector concludes that one or more parts of a process deviate beyond acceptable boundaries, the method or the material being processed must be modified. To avoid future deviation, an adjustment must be performed as soon as feasible. Scrum Master Interview Questions"
"6. What do you mean by user stories in Scrum? What are the advantages of using them? A user story is a casual, generic explanation of a so"
"7. Who is responsible for writing User Story? User stories can be written by anyone. Although it is the product owner's job to ensure that an agile user story backlog exists, this does not imply that the product owner is the one who produces them. During the early stages of product development, the team discusses needs and records them as user stories. As long as there is a product backlog, it will never be frozen. As a result, if someone thinks there's a missing requirement or anything that could benefit the client, they can add it to the queue as a user story. There is no rule or guideline indicating that the stories must be written solely by the product owner. Because there is a set format, anyone creating the story should know exactly what it means and how to write it. Scrum Master Interview Questions"
"8. Explain user story structure with an example. The User Story is outlined as follows: As a <Type of User>, I want <To Perform Some Task>, So that <I can achieve some goal/benefit/value>. Example: User Story in case of a person’s online purchase : As a Customer, I want to shop online from websites, So that I do not need to visit the local market."
"9. Is Scrum and Agile the same? If not so, diﬀerentiate between them. No, Scrum and Agile are not the same. Following are the diﬀerences between them: Scrum Master Interview Questions Scrum Master Interview Questions Agile Scrum Agile is a development methodology that takes an incremental and iterative strategy.Scrum is one of the agile methodology's implementations. In this scenario, the customer receives incremental builds every two to three weeks. Agile so"
"10. What are the roles of a Scrum Master? The Scrum Master provides support to the Scrum Team in a variety of ways, including: Mentoring members of the team in self-management and cross-functionality Assisting the Scrum Team in focusing on creating elevated Increments that meet the Definition of Done Removing roadblocks to the Scrum Team's progress Ensuring that all Scrum events occur and are positive, productive, and kept within the timeframe. The Product Owner benefits from the Scrum Master in a variety of ways, including: Assisting in the use of strategies for successful product goal definition and backlog management; Assisting the Scrum Team in comprehending the need of having clear and precise Product Backlog items; Assisting in the development of empirical product planning for a complicated environment The Scrum Master helps the company in a variety of ways, including: Scrum Master Interview Questions Leading, mentoring, and training the organization's Scrum adoption. Making plans and recommending Scrum implementations within the organization assisting employees and stakeholders in understanding and putting into practice an empirical approach to complex work. Removing barriers between stakeholders and Scrum Teams."
"11. How can you assure that the user stories meet the requirements? A good user story comprises a description as well as set acceptance criteria. It should be a piece that can be completed in a sprint and has the fewest dependencies possible. Within the sprint's constraints, the team should be able to build and test while also delivering estimations. In a nutshell, the INVEST principle is followed by good user stories. Scrum Master Interview Questions I stands for Independent - The user story should be such that the team members are less reliant on others N stands for Negotiable - It should describe the functionality and is subject to agreement between the Team and the Product Owner. V stands for Valuable - It should add value to the customer's experience. E stands for Estimable - It should be such that the time requirement can be approximately estimated. S stands for Small - It should be small enough so that the team can complete it in a sprint. T stands for Testable - It should have good acceptance criteria. During backlog refinement or sprint preparation, the scrum master can assist the team in producing good user stories so that they can be picked up for the commitment."
"12. Why are the user stories not estimated in man hours? One of the most common approaches for evaluating teamwork is to estimate in man- hours. While man-hours are simple to comprehend, they have a number of significant drawbacks: Few activities, such as legacy work, are diﬀicult to estimate precisely. If one team member delivers the estimate but the task is completed by another, the estimate is useless. The amount of time it takes to perform a task depends on the developer's level of experience. Teams frequently overestimate the obstacles they may face and simply consider the best-case scenario. Scrum Master Interview Questions The benefits of estimating user stories in points include the following: There is no association between the estimator's skills and experience, and story points are independent of the story's author. The team members can estimate more correctly since story points are a measurement of relative sizes, and the size of the story cannot be changed by external forces. As team behavior takes precedence over individual conduct, Story Points encourages collaboration. The team comes together when they use planning poker to estimate story points. As teams exchange, constructively criticize, argue, and have fun playing poker cards to arrive at an agreement on estimations, it serves as a team-building activity."
"13. What do you mean by Artifacts in Scrum? Scrum Artifacts contain critical information that the Scrum Team and stakeholders need to know in order to understand the product being developed, the activities that have been completed, and the activities that are planned for the project. The Scrum Process Framework defines the following artifacts: Scrum Master Interview Questions Product Backlog: The Product Backlog is a list of all the features, functionalities, requirements, additions, and fixes that will be included in future releases of the product. Description, order, estimate, and value are all properties of Product Backlog items. The Product Owner is in charge of the Product Backlog's content, as well as its availability and ordering. Sprint Backlog: The Sprint Backlog consists of the Product Backlog items chosen for the Sprint, as well as a strategy for delivering the product increment and achieving the Sprint Goal. It is the Team's projection of what feature will be available in the next Increment, as well as the work required to turn that functionality into a working product Increment. Increment: The Increment is the total of all Product Backlog items accomplished throughout a Sprint plus all preceding Sprint increments. The new Increment must be a working product at the end of a Sprint, which means it must be in usable form. Regardless of whether the Product Owner decides to release it, it must be in functioning condition. Sprint Burn-Down Chart: The total work remaining in the Sprint Backlog can be totalled at any point throughout the Sprint. The team keeps track of the overall work remaining for each Daily Scrum to estimate the chances of meeting the Sprint Goal. The Team can control its progress by keeping track of the remaining work during the Sprint. The Sprint Burn-Down Chart is a method of tracking how much work the Scrum Team has done in a given sprint. This has been shown to be an eﬀective method for tracking Sprint progress toward the Sprint Goal."
"14. What are the five steps of Risk Management? To manage risk, there are five essential measures to follow. They are as follows: Scrum Master Interview Questions Scrum Master Interview Questions Identification of Risk: The first step is to determine the risks that the company faces in its current operational environment. There are numerous forms of risks, including legal risks, environmental risks, market risks, regulatory risks, and so on. It's critical to recognize as many of these risk variables as possible. Analysis of the Risk: It is necessary to examine a risk once it has been recognized. The risk's scope must be assessed. It's also crucial to comprehend the relationship between risk and other internal components. It is crucial to establish the severity and importance of the risk by looking at how many business operations it aﬀects. Ranking the Risk: Risks must be prioritized and ranked. Based on the intensity of the risk, most risk management solutions have several risk categories. Risks that can result in serious loss are ranked the highest, while risks that may cause some inconvenience are rated the lowest. Treating the Risk: Every risk must be minimized or eliminated to the greatest extent practicable. This is accomplished by contacting specialists in the field to which the risk pertains. In a manual situation, this means calling each and every stakeholder and then scheduling up meetings for everyone to talk about and debate the concerns. Reviewing the Risk: The risk is then reviewed to ensure that the risk has been eliminated completely."
"15. What do you mean by timeboxing in Scrum? When can a Sprint be cancelled and by whom? Timeboxing refers to allocating a specific amount of time to a specific activity. A timebox is a time measurement unit. A timebox should be no more than 15 minutes long. Scrum Master Interview Questions Before the Sprint timebox limit expires, a Sprint can be canceled. The sprint can only be canceled by the Product Owner."
"16. How are Epic, User Story and Tasks diﬀerent from one another in the context of Scrum?

Epics are o"
"17. Who all can be the participants in the retrospective meeting? The sprint retrospective is both a time to analyze and change the process and an opportunity to reflect on it. Attendance by the entire Scrum team is required. This includes the Scrum Master, the product owner, and all members of the development team (including everyone who is designing, building, and testing the product). However, other teams may not want to include the product owner since it will obstruct their discussion. If there is a lack of trust between the product owner and the development team, or a lack of safety that prevents the product owner from speaking candidly, the product owner should not attend until the Scrum Master can help teach those engaged in building a safer, more trusting atmosphere. Anyone not on the immediate scrum team, especially team members' managers, should not be invited to participate."
"18. What do you mean by Sprint 0 and Spike? Scrum Master Interview Questions The modest amount of eﬀort put in to establish a rough skeleton of the product backlog is referred to as Sprint 0. It also contains information on calculating product release dates. Sprint 0 is necessary for the following tasks: Creating a skeleton for the project, as well as research spikes Maintaining a minimalist design Creating a few stories completely Being lightweight and having a low velocity The spike is a collection of activities that use Extreme Programming for research, design, investigation, prototyping, and other purposes. It tries to mitigate the technical approach's risks by assisting with the acquisition of knowledge in order to better comprehend requirements and increase reliability."
"19. Diﬀerentiate between Product Backlog and Sprint Backlog. Scrum Master Interview Questions Product Backlog Sprint Backlog It is a list of all the tasks that must be done before the final product may be created.It is a list of all the items collected from the Product Backlog that must be done in order for the Sprint to be completed. It also has a strategy for converting the selected items to an Increment. The Product Owner is in charge of gathering, prioritizing, and refining the Product Backlog items.The Development Team is in charge of developing the Sprint Backlog and working on it in order to complete the Sprint on time. The Product Backlog is dedicated to the product's overall goal.The Sprint Backlog solely pertains to the Sprint goal for that Sprint. Depending on the customer's vision, there may be opportunities to alter.The Sprint Goal will not change throughout the Sprint, but the Sprint Backlog may change depending on the Sprint. It has nothing to do with the Sprint Backlog.The Product Backlog is the sole determinant. Scrum Master Interview Questions"
"20. What do you mean by DoD? DoD stands for Definition of Done. It is the set of deliverables that contain written codes, comments on coding, unit tests, integration testing, design documents, release notes, and so on. This provides project development with quantifiable and demonstrable benefits. It is quite beneficial to scrum when it comes to identifying deliverables that will assist the project reach its goal. It assists with: Identifying the steps necessary to complete the iteration. The use of appropriate technologies, such as burndown, to improve the eﬀiciency of the process. Providing timely input at all stages of the project's life cycle. Assuring that the product backlog items are properly walked through and understood. The establishment of a checklist for the backlog items in the product. Assuring that it is defined in such a way that it is task-oriented. Including the product owner in the sprint review and sprint retrospective. Scrum Master Interview Questions"
"21. What is the purpose of a Scrum Master to be present at the Daily Scrum? A Scrum Master is not required to be present; all that is required of him or her is that the Development Team has a Daily Scrum. Only Development Team members are allowed to participate in the Daily Scrum. Although the Scrum Master or Product Owner is welcome to attend this meeting to help with the Daily Scrum, Scrum does not necessitate it. During the Daily Scrum, the Development Team members synchronize their work, track their progress toward the Sprint Goal, and, if necessary, adjust the Sprint Backlog and the plan for the following 24 hours."
22. What do you mean by ‘Confidence Vote’ in Scrum? Why is it important? A
"23. What do you mean by Scrum of Scrums? Scrum Master Interview Questions Scrum of Scrums is a scalable agile technique for connecting several teams that must collaborate to produce complicated solutions. It enables teams to design and deliver complicated products at scale by facilitating transparency, inspection, and adaption. It's especially eﬀective when all members of a high-performing Scrum team work toward a single purpose, have complete trust and respect for one another and are completely aligned. It is a virtual team made up of delegates who are connected to the original delivery teams via embedded linkages. These interconnected team architectures simplify communication paths when compared to traditional organizational hierarchies or project-based teams. The goal is to coordinate smaller, self-contained groups."
"24. Diﬀerentiate between MVP and MMR. Scrum Master Interview Questions Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is a Lean Startup concept that emphasizes the importance of learning while developing a product. This enables one to test and understand the concept by exposing target consumers and users to the initial version. To accomplish this, one must first gather all pertinent data and then learn from it. The MVP concept is to create a product, provide consumers access to it, and observe how the product is used, perceived, and understood. This will also give you a better idea of what the needs of your clients or users are. Successful products are released into the market in stages over time, with each ""significant"" deployment referred to as a release. An MMR (Minimum Marketable Release) is a product release with the minimal possible feature set that solves your customers' current new needs. MMRs are used to shorten time-to-market between releases by condensing each release's coherent feature set to the lowest increment that provides new value to customers."
"25. What are the three C’s in an User Story? Following are the three C’s in a User Story: Scrum Master Interview Questions Card: It is a written account of the story that is utilized to plan and estimate. To keep user stories succinct, they are manually written on index ""cards."" Conversation: The Conversation is required to learn more about the Card. The conversation encourages the agile team to work together in small steps to develop a shared understanding of the problem and potential solutions. Confirmation: Confirmation is an acceptance criteria that contains the fundamental requirements and turns them into test criteria so that we can determine when the user story has been properly provided."
26. How will a Scrum Master prevent extreme weariness induced due to retrospectives? Scrum Master Interview Questions When Scrum teams repeat the same pattern of a retrospective sprint a
"27. The Agile methodology emphasises the importance of ""People Over Processes."" Is the Scrum Master's responsibility of enforcing ""the process"" a contradiction? Despite the fact that Scrum describes the Scrum Master as the person in charge of enforcing the process, it is critical to understand what this enforcing position entails and what its limitations are. Enforcement does not imply forcing the team to follow the process; rather, it entails putting Scrum's essential elements into practice to aid the teams' success. The Scrum Master is a facilitator who assists the teams in achieving their objectives. The Scrum Master will apply Scrum methods and urge the team to follow the scrum values during facilitation. It is critical to emphasize that we are discussing encouragement rather than coercion. It is not a project manager's role, but it will assist teams in resolving their roadblocks; it will be a collaborative eﬀort rather than a directive one. The scrum master will try to demonstrate the benefits of adopting the processes and assist the team in gaining a grasp of the scrum processes from time to time, which is similar to demonstrating the proper route but allowing the team to choose whether or not to go down it. The scrum master will also serve as a mentor for the team, assisting them in achieving success in their agile journey."
"28. How will the Scrum Master make sure that the team delivers action items on time? Scrum Master Interview Questions The team must identify action items in order for the retrospective to be eﬀective. This provides the team with a starting point for a discussion, but simply naming will not suﬀice. The action items should be closed as soon as possible, and the scrum master should take steps to accomplish this. Every action item should have an owner, and teams should avoid assigning several owners to a single item because ownership becomes diluted. The scrum master should keep track of action items in a programme or spreadsheet that is accessible to everyone on the team. Having a backlog of action items is also beneficial since it allows the team to prioritize."
"29. What do you mean by Velocity in the context of Scrum? Does having maximum Velocity ensure maximum Productivity? The amount of work performed by a team during a sprint is measured by velocity. It refers to the number of user stories that have been finished in a sprint. Scrum Master Interview Questions No, having maximum Velocity does not ensure maximum Productivity. A team's attempt to enhance velocity may actually result in the reverse. If pressed for time, a team may forgo unit or acceptance testing, reduce customer collaboration, forgo issue fixes, minimize refactoring, and many other critical benefits of the agile development approach. While there may be a short-term benefit, there will be a long- term detrimental consequence. The goal is to achieve optimal velocity over time, which takes into account a variety of parameters, including the end product's quality."
"30. How can a Scrum Master ensure that the three pillars of Scrum are being implemented by the team? Following are the ways by which a Scrum Master can ensure that the three pillars of Scrum are being implemented by the team: Daily Scrum: Examine the Team Board and adjust the plan for the next day, making sure that any changes are communicated to the entire team. Examine the Impediments Board and, if necessary, adapt ways to address impediments. Sprint Planning: Examine the average Team Velocity for the preceding three or four Sprints, verify that the velocities were transparent to the team, and verify that the team adapted the Velocity to be used for Sprint planning. Examine the Product Backlog (PB) to ensure that it is current, transparent to all stakeholders and that the team adjusts the PBI estimations as needed. Sprint Retrospective: Examine the procedure that was followed and make preparations to adapt it if required, ensuring that any modifications are communicated to all team members. Sprint Review: Inspect the increment and, if necessary, adjust the Product Backlog, ensuring that any changes are communicated to all stakeholders. Examine the Release Plan and make any required adjustments, ensuring that any changes are communicated to all stakeholders. Scrum Master Interview Questions"
"31. What do you mean by Scrum Master as a Servant Leader? A servant-leader is someone who : Focuses on establishing a trusting relationship. Encourages transparency and empowerment. Encourages teamwork and collaboration Demonstrates ethical and compassionate behavior by prioritizing the needs of others. Is humble, well-informed, upbeat, socially conscious, and situationally aware. A Scrum Master is a master at motivating, enabling, and inspiring individuals to work together as a team and reach their maximum potential. A Scrum Master is a servant- leader who prioritizes the needs of team members and those they serve (customers), with the purpose of generating results that are consistent with the organization's values, principles, and goals. The Scrum Master's responsibilities as a servant-leader include: Setting Scrum up as a servant rather than a commanding process. Assisting the Development team in becoming self-organized. Guiding the group via constructive conflict and debate. Scrum adoption and use are taught, coached, and mentored by the organization and team."
"32. Is daily standup recommended for all teams regardless of their size and experience level. Explain. The daily stand-up meeting allows the team to reflect on how the team's commitment to the sprint goal is progressing. As a result, all agile teams should meet on a frequent basis to ensure that everyone is on the same page. Depending on the size and level of experience, the standup can be done in a variety of ways. Scrum Master Interview Questions Small and Experienced - If the team is small and the members are experienced, they can meet for a quick break or even an informal meeting. Small and Inexperienced - If the team is small and inexperienced, the Scrum Master should prefer going through a formal standup because the team needs to understand the progress, they may require assistance with technicalities or business functionality, and they must also understand the values, principles, and discipline in the process. Large - With large teams, taking a casual approach may be problematic, as formal meetings are essential to provide guidance and clarity. Distributed Teams - Because there is a location constraint in the case of scattered teams, the teams can use the ‘dial-in' and conduct the daily scrum in an organized manner."
"33. What do you understand about Scope Creep? How can Scope Creep be managed? Scope creep describes how a project's requirements tend to grow over time, such as when a single deliverable product gets split into five or when a product with three essential features needs ten essential features or when the customer's needs change midway through a project, prompting a reassessment of the project requirements. Scope creep is frequently caused by changes in project requirements from key stakeholders, as well as internal miscommunication and conflicts. Scrum Master Interview Questions Controlling scope creep through a change control procedure is the key to managing scope creep. This entails: Keeping track of the project's progress and establishing a baseline scope Using variance analysis to compare actual work performance metrics to the baseline scope, i.e., ""How diﬀerent is the present project from the initial plan?"" Identifying the source and severity of the observed changes Choosing whether corrective or preventive action is required in response to change requests Using the Perform Integrated Change Control procedure, manage all change requests and recommended actions (whether corrective or preventive)."
"34. Can the Scrum team be involved in the product discovery process? If so, explain how. Making the scrum team a participant in the discovery process early in the product development lifecycle is quite beneficial. Agile refers to teams engaging with stakeholders early in the development process so that both parties are on the same page. Consider some of the benefits of early involvement: Scrum Master Interview Questions The development teams can help in modifying the specifications with the client by identifying technical implementation issues early in the process. Along with the product owner, the team begins to share a shared knowledge of what needs to be built. Teams can sometimes assist the product owner in detecting requirements that might have been overlooked. They have a common concept of what needs to be constructed. It also helps teams stay dedicated and confident, encourages them to take ownership of their job, and, most importantly, increases team spirit. To help with this, the scrum master can begin including the teams in early product discussions when the requirements are still vague. The product backlog can be built by the team and the product owner."
"DBMS Interview Questions RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System and was introduced in the 1970s to access and store data more eﬀiciently than DBMS. RDBMS stores data in the form of tables as compared to DBMS which stores data as files. Storing data as rows and columns makes it easier to locate specific values in the database and makes it more eﬀicient as compared to DBMS. Examples of popular RDBMS systems are MySQL, Oracle DB, etc."
"2. What is meant by a database? A Database is an organized, consistent, and logical collection of data that can easily be updated, accessed, and managed. Database mostly contains sets of tables or objects (anything created using create command is a database object) which consist of records and fields. A tuple or a row represents a single entry in a table. An attribute or a column represents the basic units of data storage, which contain information about a particular aspect of the table. DBMS extracts data from a database in the form of queries given by the user."
"3. Mention the issues with traditional file-based systems that make DBMS a better choice? The absence of indexing in a traditional file-based system leaves us with the only option of scanning the full page and hence making the access of content tedious and super slow. The other issue is redundancy and inconsistency as files have many duplicate and redundant data and changing one of them makes all of them inconsistent. Accessing data is harder in traditional file-based systems because data is unorganized in them. Another issue is the lack of concurrency control, which leads to one operation locking the entire page, as compared to DBMS where multiple operations can work on a single file simultaneously. Integrity check, data isolation, atomicity, security, etc. are some other issues with traditional file-based systems for which DBMSs have provided some good solutions."
"4. Explain a few advantages of a DBMS. Following are the few advantages of using a DBMS. DBMS Interview Questions Data Sharing: Data from a single database can be simultaneously shared by multiple users. Such sharing also enables end-users to react to changes quickly in the database environment. Integrity constraints: The existence of such constraints allows storing of data in an organized and refined manner. Controlling redundancy in a database: Eliminates redundancy in a database by providing a mechanism that integrates all the data in a single database. Data Independence: This allows changing the data structure without altering the composition of any of the executing application programs. Provides backup and recovery facility: It can be configured to automatically create the backup of the data and restore the data in the database whenever required. Data Security: DBMS provides the necessary tools to make the storage and transfer of data more reliable and secure. Authentication (the process of giving restricted access to a user) and encryption (encrypting sensitive data such as OTP, credit card information, etc.) are some popular tools used to secure data in a DBMS."
"5. Explain diﬀerent languages present in DBMS. DBMS Interview Questions Following are various languages present in DBMS: DDL(Data Definition Language): It contains commands which are required to define the database. E.g., CREATE, ALTER, DROP, TRUNCATE, RENAME, etc. DML(Data Manipulation Language): It contains commands which are required to manipulate the data present in the database. E.g., SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, DELETE, etc. DCL(Data Control Language): It contains commands which are required to deal with the user permissions and controls of the database system. E.g., GRANT and REVOKE. TCL(Transaction Control Language): It contains commands which are required to deal with the transaction of the database. E.g., COMMIT, ROLLBACK, and SAVEPOINT."
"6. What is meant by ACID properties in DBMS? ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability in a DBMS these are those properties that ensure a safe and secure way of sharing data among multiple users. DBMS Interview Questions Atomicity: This property reflects the concept of either executing the whole query or executing nothing at all, which implies that if an update occurs in a database then that update should either be reflected in the whole database or should not be reflected at all. DBMS Interview Questions Consistency: This property ensures that the data remains consistent before and a"
"7. Are NULL values in a database the same as that of blank space or zero? No, a NULL value is very diﬀerent from that of zero and blank space as it represents a value that is assigned, unknown, unavailable, or not applicable as compared to blank space which represents a character and zero represents a number. Example: NULL value in “number_of_courses” taken by a student represents that its value is unknown whereas 0 in it means that the student hasn’t taken any courses. Intermediate DBMS Interview Questions"
"8. What is meant by Data Warehousing? DBMS Interview Questions The process of collecting, extracting, transforming, and loading data from multiple sources and storing them into one database is known as data warehousing. A data warehouse can be considered as a central repository where data flows from transactional systems and other relational databases and is used for data analytics. A data warehouse comprises a wide variety of organization’s historical data that supports the decision-making process in an organization."
"9. Explain diﬀerent levels of data abstraction in a DBMS. The process of hiding irrelevant details from users is known as data abstraction. Data abstraction can be divided into 3 levels: DBMS Interview Questions Physical Level: it is the lowest level and is managed by DBMS. This level consists of data storage descriptions and the details of this level are typically hidden from system admins, developers, and users. Conceptual or Logical level: it is the level on which developers and system admins work and it determines what data is stored in the database and what is the relationship between the data points. External or View level: it is the level that describes only part of the database and hides the details of the table schema and its physical storage from the users. The result of a query is an example of View level data abstraction. A view is a virtual table created by selecting fields from one or more tables present in the database."
"10. What is meant by an entity-relationship (E-R) model? Explain the terms Entity, Entity Type, and Entity Set in DBMS. An entity-relationship model is a diagrammatic approach to a database design where real-world objects are represented as entities and relationships between them are mentioned. DBMS Interview Questions Entity: An entity is defined as a real-world object having attributes that represent characteristics of that particular object. For example, a student, an employee, or a teacher represents an entity. Entity Type: An entity type is defined as a collection of entities that have the same attributes. One or more related tables in a database represent an entity type. Entity type or attributes can be understood as a characteristic which uniquely identifies the entity. For example, a student represents an entity that has attributes such as student_id, student_name, etc. Entity Set: An entity set can be defined as a set of all the entities present in a specific entity type in a database. For example, a set of all the students, employees, teachers, etc. represent an entity set."
11. Explain diﬀerent types of relationships amongst tables in a DBMS. Following are diﬀerent types of relationship amongst tables in a DBMS system: One to One Relationship: This type of relationship is applied when a particular row in table X is linked to a singular row in table Y. DBMS Interview Questions One to Many Relationship: This type of relationship is applied when a single row in table X is related to many rows in table Y. Many to Many Relationship: This type of relationship is applied when multiple rows in table X can be linked to multiple rows in table Y. Self Referencing Relationship: This type of relationship is applied when a particular row in table X is associated with the same table. DBMS Interview Questions
"12. Explain the diﬀerence between intension and extension in a database. Following is the major diﬀerence between intension and extension in a database: Intension: Intension or popularly known as database schema is used to define the description of the database and is specified during the design of the database and mostly remains unchanged. Extension: Extension on the other hand is the measure of the number of tuples present in the database at any given point in time. The extension of a database is also referred to as the snapshot of the database and its value keeps changing as and when the tuples are created, updated, or destroyed in a database."
13. Explain the diﬀerence between the DELETE and TRUNCATE command in a DBMS. DELETE command: this command is needed to delete rows from a table based on the condition provided by the WHERE clause. DBMS Interview Questions It deletes only the rows which are specified by the WHERE clause. It can be rolled back if required. It maintains a log to lock the row of the table before deleting it and hence it’s slow. TRUNCATE command: this command is needed to remove complete data from a table in a database. It is like a DELETE command which has no WHERE clause. It removes complete data from a table in a database. It can be rolled back even if required. It doesn’t maintain a log and deletes the whole table at once and hence it’s fast.
14. What is a lock. Explain the major diﬀerence between a shared lock and an exclusive lock during a transaction in a database. A database lock is a mechanism to protect a shared piece of data from getting updated by two or more database users at the same time. When a single database user or session has acquired a lock then no other database user or session can modify that data until the lock is released. Shared Lock: A shared lock is required for reading a data item and many transactions may hold a lock on the same data item in a shared lock. Multiple transactions are allowed to read the data items in a shared lock. Exclusive lock: An exclusive lock is a lock on any transaction that is about to perform a write operation. This type of lock doesn’t allow more than one transaction and hence prevents any inconsistency in the database.
15. What is meant by normalization and denormalization? Normalization is a process of reducing redundancy by organizing the data into multiple tables. Normalization leads to better usage of disk spaces and makes it easier to maintain the integrity of the database. DBMS Interview Questions Denormalization is the reverse process of normalization as it combines the tables which have been normalized into a single table so that data retrieval becomes faster. JOIN operation allows us to create a denormalized form of the data by reversing the normalization. Advanced DBMS Interview Questions
"16. Explain diﬀerent types of Normalization forms in a DBMS. Following are the major normalization forms in a DBMS: DBMS Interview Questions Considering the above Table-1 as the reference example for understanding diﬀerent normalization forms. 1NF: It is known as the first normal form and is the simplest type of normalization that you can implement in a database. A table to be in its first normal form should satisfy the following conditions: Every column must have a single value and should be atomic. Duplicate columns from the same table should be removed. Separate tables should be created for each group of related data and each row should be identified with a unique column. DBMS Interview Questions Table-1 converted to 1NF form 2NF: It is known as the second normal form. A table to be in its second normal form should satisfy the following conditions: The table should be in its 1NF i.e. satisfy all the conditions of 1NF. Every non-prime attribute of the table should be fully functionally dependent on the primary key i.e. every non-key attribute should be dependent on the primary key in such a way that if any key element is deleted then even the non_key element will be saved in the database. DBMS Interview Questions Breaking Table-1 into 2 diﬀerent tables to move it to 2NF. 3NF: It is known as the third normal form. A table to be in its second normal form should satisfy the following conditions: The table should be in its 2NF i.e. satisfy all the conditions of 2NF. There is no transitive functional dependency of one attribute on any attribute in the same table. DBMS Interview Questions Breaking Table-1 into 3 diﬀerent tables to move it to 3NF. BCNF: BCNF stands for Boyce-Codd Normal Form and is an advanced form of 3NF. It is also referred to as 3.5NF for the same reason. A table to be in its BCNF normal form should satisfy the following conditions: The table should be in its 3NF i.e. satisfy all the conditions of 3NF. For every functional dependency of any attribute A on B (A->B), A should be the super key of the table. It simply implies that A can’t be a non-prime attribute if B is a prime attribute. DBMS Interview Questions"
"17. Explain diﬀerent types of keys in a database. There are mainly 7 types of keys in a database: Candidate Key: The candidate key represents a set of properties that can uniquely identify a table. Each table may have multiple candidate keys. One key amongst all candidate keys can be chosen as a primary key. In the below example since studentId and firstName can be considered as a Candidate Key since they can uniquely identify every tuple. Super Key: The super key defines a set of attributes that can uniquely identify a tuple. Candidate key and primary key are subsets of the super key, in other words, the super key is their superset. DBMS Interview Questions Primary Key: The primary key defines a set of attributes that are used to uniquely identify every tuple. In the below example studentId and firstName are candidate keys and any one of them can be chosen as a Primary Key. In the given example studentId is chosen as the primary key for the student table. Unique Key: The unique key is very similar to the primary key except that primary keys don’t allow NULL values in the column but unique keys allow them. So essentially unique keys are primary keys with NULL values. Alternate Key: All the candidate keys which are not chosen as primary keys are considered as alternate Keys. In the below example, firstname and lastname are alternate keys in the database. Foreign Key: The foreign key defines an attribute that can only take the values present in one table common to the attribute present in another table. In the below example courseId from the Student table is a foreign key to the Course table, as both, the tables contain courseId as one of their attributes. Composite Key: A composite key refers to a combination of two or more columns that can uniquely identify each tuple in a table. In the below example the studentId and firstname can be grouped to uniquely identify every tuple in the table. DBMS Interview Questions"
JMeter Interview Questions JMeter Interview Questions for Freshers
"1. Discuss some of the features of JMeter. The following are some of the features of Apache JMeter: JMeter Interview Questions The ability to load and performance test a wide range of apps, servers, and protocols. This includes the following : Web - HTTP, HTTPS (Java, NodeJS, PHP, ASP.NET, …) SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)/ REST (Representational State Transfer) Web Services FTP (File Transfer Protocol) Database via JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) Message-oriented middleware (MOM) via JMS (Java Message Service) Mail - SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)(S), POP3 (Post Oﬀice Protocol 3)(S) and IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol)(S) Native commands or shell scripts TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) Java Objects Full-featured Test IDE for recording (from browsers or native applications), developing, and debugging Test Plans (A Test Plan is where you add elements that are needed for your JMeter Test.) To load-test from any Java-compatible OS (Linux, Windows, Mac OSX,...), use CLI mode (Command-line mode (formerly termed Non-GUI) / headless mode). It has the option to generate a dynamic HTML report that is full and ready to present. The ability to extract data from the most popular response formats, such as HTML, JSON, XML, or any textual format, allows for easy correlation. Complete portability and Java purity are guaranteed in Jmeter. Concurrent sampling by several threads and simultaneous sampling of distinct functions by separate thread groups are both possible with a full multithreading framework. It also has the option of test results caching and analysis/replaying oﬀline. Extensible core: Pluggable Samplers oﬀer limitless testing capabilities. With pluggable timers, you can choose from a variety of load statistics. Plugins for data analysis and visualisation oﬀer a lot of flexibility and personalization. The employment of functions can be utilised to oﬀer dynamic input to a test or to manipulate data. 3rd party Open Source libraries for Maven, Gradle, and Jenkins make Continuous Integration simple. JMeter Interview Questions"
2. What is Distributed Testing? Distributed testing refers to the use of numerous machines for load testing (Load testing is the technique of simulating several users accessing a so
"3. In JMeter, how do you set up a master-slave configuration? A master-slave configuration is a type of distributed testing in which multiple machines are used to load test a single server. It's critical that all machines are connected to the same network and have the same JMeter version. In distributed testing, one machine is designated as the master, while the others are designated as slaves. JMeter Interview Questions The procedure is as follows: Edit the JMeter.properties file on the master system and add the IP addresses of slave machines to the remote host column. Save the file and then reopen JMeter. Select Remote Start from the RUN menu in JMeter and enter the IP address of the system to be invoked. To start all the slave machines for testing, go to the RUN menu and select Remote Start all."
4. Explain the usage of Regular Expression in JMeter. Also discuss the diﬀerence between ‘contains’ and ‘matches’. Pattern-based regular expressions are used to find and manipulate text in Jmeter. JMeter uses the pattern matching so
"5. Discuss about Samplers and Thread Groups in JMeter. JMeter Interview Questions A Thread Group is a collection of threads that are all working on the same problem. Every JMeter test plan starts with this element. Multiple thread groups are provided, each of which can be set to imitate how users interact with the application, how the load is sustained, and for how long. JMeter's samplers allow JMeter to make various types of requests to a server. JMeter provides genuine queries to the web server under test using samplers. Except for Test Action, each sampler generates one or more sample results. The sample results can be viewed in several ways and have various features (success/failure, elapsed time, data quantity, etc.)."
"6. What are the diﬀerent types of processors available in JMeter? In JMeter, there are two types of processors: the Pre-Processor and the Post- Processor. Pre-Processors run before the main sampler and have the ability to change the scope of the sampler. PreProcessors are JMeter elements that are used to perform actions prior to the execution of sampler requests in a test scenario. PreProcessors can be used for a variety of performance testing tasks, such as retrieving data from a database, setting a timeout between sampler operations, or generating test data. Post Processors run a"
"7. Mention the order of execution of JMeter test plan elements. The execution order of the test plan elements is - JMeter Interview Questions Configuration elements- The Configuration Element allows us to declare variables that Samplers can utilise to access data. Pre-processors- PreProcessors are JMeter elements that are used to perform actions prior to the execution of sampler queries in a test scenario. Timers- A JMeter Timer is an inbuilt JMeter plug-in that can assist you in timing out your sampler requests. Many testers refer to this pause in requests as ""think time,"" as it simulates the time spent by real users between steps in a real-world scenario. Samplers- JMeter uses samplers to make several types of queries to a server. JMeter provides genuine queries to the web server under test using samplers. Except for Test Action, each sampler delivers one or maybe more sample results. Post-processors- A"
8. Explain configuration elements in JMeter. JMeter's config components are used to customise or change the sampler queries sent to the server. These components are inserted at the same level as or higher than the samplers we want to configure. A Sampler and a configuration element work in conjunction. Configuration elements can be used to set defaults and variables for subsequent usage by samplers. These elements are processed at the start of the scope before any samplers in the same scope.
"9. What are the various data parameterization options in JMeter? JMeter Interview Questions Data parameterization allows test scripts to be reused by removing the need for hardcoding values for the same request with varied parameters. In a single test script, parameterization is the process of establishing distinct datasets for diﬀerent users. For instance, in the same script, executing numerous users with diﬀerent credentials. As a result, it's one of the most important components of creating performance testing. The data parameterization provided by JMeter is listed below: Config of a CSV Data Set - The CSV Data Set Config reads all values from a CSV file, stores them in variables, and uses them as Test Data during execution. The ""CSV Data Set Config"" allows you to save unique user data such as names, emails, and passwords in CSV files as an external data source. JMeter can read the CSV file line by line with the help of this config element, and then use split parameters to assign diﬀerent values to separate threads. Variables that are defined by the user - User-defined variables (UDV) are used to define specific variables that can hold values that you need in several places. UserDefinedVariables diﬀer from CSVDataSetConfig in that CSV can hold hundreds of thousands of values, whilst UDV is only suited for tiny data sets. You can also specify variable/user values in UDV. This could be useful in instances where two users should use the same value and the next two users should use a diﬀerent value. Also, if you declare a variable at the Test Plan/Thread Group level and then have the same variable with a diﬀerent value inside one of two thread groups or a specific sampler. In this scenario, the local variable will override the global variable."
"10. What is assertions in JMeter? In JMeter, assertions are used to validate the response to a request that you have given to the server. The assertion is the process of comparing the expected and actual results of a request at runtime. If you want to apply assertion to a certain Sampler, make it a child of that Sampler. By adding ""Assertion Listener"" to the Thread Group, you can see assertion outcomes. Other listeners will be able to see failed assertions as well. Some common assertions in JMeter are: JMeter Interview Questions Response Assertion: Response Assertion is used for combining and comparing pattern strings against one or more server response values. Size Assertion: Size Assertion is used to check whether the server response includes the expected number of bytes. Duration Assertion: The Duration Assertion is used to check whether or not a server response is received within a defined time limit. If the response takes longer than the specified time, the sample request will be marked as unsuccessful. XML Assertion: XML Assertion is used to check whether the server response data contains a valid XML document. HTML Assertion: HTML Assertion is used to ensure that the response contains proper HTML syntax and that JTidy is not being used (HTML Syntax Checker). If the HTML syntax response is incorrect, the test will fail."
"11. What is the maximum number of threads that should be allowed on a single system? It depends on your system's hardware setup, which includes a processor, JVM, and allotted memory -Xmx, among other things. The number of components in your test plan, such as the number of config items or processors, as well as whether you are using GUI or Non-GUI Mode, have an impact on thread count."
"12. Discuss Gaussian and Poisson Timers. JMeter sends requests immediately, with no latency between samplers or requests. Your server will be overburdened if you perform load/stress testing immediately. Then it won't be able to provide you with realistic findings and won't be able to mimic real-world user traﬀic. JMeter Timers are the answer to all of these issues. To apply a wait between each sampler/request, a timer element can be added to a test plan. Both Gaussian and Poisson Timers are based on a mathematical formula with a constant delay and oﬀset. JMeter Interview Questions JMeter Gaussian Random Timer is used to produce and add a random delay before executing a sampler, as the name implies. Each user request is delayed for a random period of time using the Gaussian Random Timer element. Based on the Gaussian curve distribution, it has a random deviation around the Constant Delay Oﬀset. The sum of the Gaussian distributed value (with mean 0.0 and standard deviation 1.0) times the deviation value you choose and the oﬀset value is the delay (think) time. JMeter Poisson Random Timer is also used to produce and add a random delay before executing a sampler. The Poisson Distribution Function is used to create this timer. The total of the Poisson distributed value multiplied by the defined lambda value and the oﬀset value is the delay (think) time."
"13. In JMeter, explain the purpose of correlation. Correlation is the process of taking values from a server response and then storing them in a variable that will be used in subsequent requests. Correlation is the way of acquiring some value from one step's response and transferring it to another step's request. It catches and saves the server's dynamic answer before passing it on to subsequent requests. When a response returns diﬀerent data for each iterating request, it is termed dynamic, and this can sometimes aﬀect subsequent requests. Correlation is a critical step in the performance load test scripting process since if it isn't handled properly, the script will become ineﬀective. One of the most fundamental components of scripting is a correlation. It retrieves dynamic data from previous requests and posts it to new requests. For example, if you need to test any login feature and need to use the session ID or the cookie ID, you can obtain the values from the login page's GET response and use them dynamically for login in a POST request. JMeter Interview Questions"
"14. What are the various kinds of listeners? Performance testing is examining server responses in multiple formats before delivering them to the client. As a sampler component of JMeter is implemented, listeners give a graphical representation of data gathered by JMeter regarding those test cases. The user can view sampler results in the form of tables, graphs, trees, or plain text in a log file. Listeners can be changed at any point during the test, including within the test plan. JMeter provides roughly 15 listeners, but the most commonly used ones are table, tree, and graph. In short, Listeners are used to storing the results of load testing execution in various formats, such as a table, tree, graph or any other appropriate format that may be given to the client. JMeter comes with a variety of built-in listeners, and many more can be added through plugins, depending on your needs. The following are a few of the inbuilt listeners: View Results in Table, Graph Results, Aggregate Report, Aggregate Graph, Response Time Graph and Assertion Results."
"15. What exactly is a workbench? A workbench is a storage location for adding some components to the test plan if necessary. Workbench components are not immediately saved with the test plan. They must be saved as test fragments individually. The HTTP(s) Test script recorder is a key component of the Workbench, as it allows you to record HTTPS requests and then apply a load on +9859 them to assess response time."
"16. Discuss the working of the Test Script Recorder. JMeter Interview Questions The HTTP(s) Test Script Recorder records all of your application's HTTP(s) queries to the server. It will only collect HTTP(s) requests, as the name implies. You can also use this recorder's grouping feature to structure your requests so that comparable requests are kept together. As needed, add URL patterns to the include and exclude lists. In order for JMeter to work, some configurations must be done there. The following are the steps to capture HTTPS traﬀic: - HTTP(s) Test script recorder is to be added to WorkBench. To start the proxy server, type in the port number. Select ""Workbench"" as the target, or include a Recording Controller in the test plan and use the same target to save all recordings. The proxy server should now be running. Manually configure your browser's proxy settings to the same port number as the test script recorder."
"17. What protocols are supported by JMeter? JMeter supports a number of standard protocols, including: Web: HTTP/HTTPs Web Services: SOAP / XML-RPC Database via JDBC drivers Directory: LDAP Messaging Oriented service via JMS Service: POP3, IMAP, SMTP FTP (File Transfer Protocol) Service"
"18. Explain the JMeter variable and function syntax. Variables and functions are utilised in JMeter, just as they are in any other programming language, to make scripts reusable (since a function can be called again and again without having the need to write the same code again and again). Variables can be used to hold any value and then referenced anywhere in your code, just like any other programming language. So, with JMeter, it may be your server name, path, port number, or whatever else you want to save in a variable and utilise in multiple places a"
"19. Is it possible to use JMeter to record actions using a mobile device? If so, how would you go about doing it? Yes, JMeter can also record HTTP or HTTPS requests sent to the server through your mobile application. Mobile and JMeter must be connected to the same network. The following is the needed configuration: In JMeter, set your proxy server to run on a specific port. Set up the proxy on your phone's wifi settings and use the same port number as the recorder. On your mobile device, install the Root CA certificate. From your mobile, send server requests and watch them get captured by the selected controller."
"20. Why is running JMeter in Non-GUI mode recommended? JMeter Interview Questions JMeter tests can be conducted in GUI or non-GUI modes. Because the AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit) event thread can kill the tests in high load conditions, it is highly advised to conduct the load test in Non-GUI mode. JMeter's GUI mode is ideal for adding and updating new configuration components, thread groups, and samplers, as well as viewing a variety of diﬀerent listeners for troubleshooting. The GUI option, on the other hand, has a constraint that slows down CPU consumption while running the recorded script. JMeter performance suﬀers when several listeners are used in a script. In order to avoid this, the script should be run in non-GUI mode. In non-GUI mode, there is a benefit to driving more requests per second out of JMeter. JMeter supports a number of non-GUI modes, including: Command-line ANT plugin MAVEN plugin Jenkins"
"21. How do you perform spike testing with JMeter? Spike Testing is a type of performance assessment that examines how the system behaves when the load is significantly increased on the system. Using the Synchronizing Timer in JMeter, you may perform spike testing. The threads are clogged by synchronising the timer until a certain number of threads are blocked, then releasing them all at once, resulting in a significant sudden load. JMeter oﬀers you two options to carry out spike testing: JMeter Interview Questions Use the JMeter Ultimate Thread Group: This strategy will necessitate advance planning. Using the Ultimate Thread Group, the tester can perform many ramp- ups and ramp-downs in a single test. These could be gradual or more abrupt. For our purposes, you could introduce a spike during the test, for example, a"
"22. Is it possible for you to use JMeter to run Selenium scripts? If so, how would you go about doing it? Yes, you can run Selenium scripts in JMeter in order to get an indication of how well they perform. It can be done in two ways. You can either utilise JUnit libraries to create Selenium scripts and save them as Jars, which you can then add to the JMeter directory. Then, in your test plan, add the JUnit sampler and import the Jar file. Or else, you can place the Webdriver sampler plugin in the JMeter ext folder. JMeter should be restarted. In the Webdriver sampler, write your Selenium code and then run it to observe how it performs."
"23. In JMeter, how do you handle sessions and cookies? In JMeter, sessions and cookies may be controlled via config components like HTTP Cache Manager, which allows you to clear cookies a"
"24. What are the crucial steps in the JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) request testing process? JDBC requests are used to create a connection with databases and then to track query response times. The following are important procedures to take when evaluating JDBC requests: Setting up the Config Element, JDBC Connection setup, and adding the Database URL and JDBC Driver Class according to the database. Add the name of the variable for this connection configuration so that it can be used in the sampler. JDBC Request should be added. Write your queries to the test using the same variable name as before."
"25. What is BeanShell scripting? BeanShell is one of the most advanced JMeter built-in components. BeanShell is a lightweight Java scripting language that JMeter uses to do some sophisticated tasks. With the help of coding, the BeanShell sampler can execute a variety of tasks. You can get the thread number, run the current sampler, collect the cookies, and so forth. It comprehends Java syntax and provides scripting features such as loose types, commands and method closures. BeanShell can be a wonderful solution to achieve your goals if your test case is peculiar and creating it using embedded JMeter components is nearly impossible. BeanShell entities in JMeter include accessibility both to internal JMeter APIs as well as any external classes packed into the JMeter classpath (make sure to drop appropriate jars into your JMeter installation's /lib/ext folder and place the relevant ""import"" statements at the top of your BeanShell scripts). The following BeanShell-enabled components are available in all JMeter versions: JMeter Interview Questions Beanshell Sampler: A sampler that can operate independently. Beanshell PreProcessor: A sampler pre-processor that operates before the sampler and can be used to establish prerequisites (i.e. to generate some input). Beanshell PostProcessor: A post-processor that runs a"
"26. Write the code to write data stored in a JMeter variable to a CSV file. To write data to a CSV file, use the lines of code below inside a BeanShell postprocessor. dataString = vars.get(""DataToBeWritten""); filePath = vars.get(""DataFilePath""); // you should pass true if you want to append the data to an existing file // if you wish to overwrite, then do not pass the second argument FileWriter fstream = new FileWriter(filePath, true); BufferedWriter out = new BufferedWriter(fstream); out.write(dataString); out.write(System.getProperty(""line.separator"")); out.close(); fstream.close(); In the above code, the data is written to an existing file. The path of the existing file is stored in filePath, and the data in dataString is appended to the file."
"27. What is a Root Certificate Authority (CA) certificate? JMeter Interview Questions A certificate is required to authenticate HTTPS connections, which are established when the browser connects to the webserver. JMeter creates it for the purpose of intercepting SSL traﬀic and recording actions. This certificate must be installed on your mobile device in order to record actions via mobile. It is necessary to install the JMeter protected CA certificate in the browser before recording any secured web application with JMeter. The HTTP(S) Test Script Recorder in JMeter can be used to record the protected online application. Certificates are used to authenticate the connection between the browser and the web server in secured (HTTPS) communications. The server presents the certificate to the browser when connecting through HTTPS. The browser verifies that the server certificate is signed by a Certificate Authority (CA) that is related to one of the browser's built-in root CAs. To intercept the HTTPS connection from the browser, JMeter must utilise its own certificate to enable encrypted connections. JMeter must eﬀectively impersonate the target server."
"28. What factors influence the number of threads that should be generated per system? It is dependent on the system's hardware. On a 2-3 GHz CPU, for example, 400-600 threads can be produced. It also depends on the elements included in your test strategy. The higher the number of processors and XML processing components, the higher the CPU burden and, as a result, the fewer threads. Load testing with multiple machines is recommended for large loads."
"29. What are the most significant plugins that JMeter supports? JMeter comes with a lot of functionality by default, but one of the best things about it is that its open-source so"
"30. In JMeter, what are the diﬀerent sorts of controllers? In JMeter, controllers are used to regulating the flow of request execution. They allow you to specify the order in which requests are processed in a Thread. It allows you to choose ""when"" a user request is sent to a web server. They choose the sequence in which user requests are processed. JMeter Interview Questions Some controllers used in JMeter are listed below: Recording controller- JMeter has the ability to record your testing steps; a recording controller is a container for these recordings. IF controller- IF Controller decides whether or not to run a batch of child samplers based on particular criteria. While controller- The JMeter While Controller basically runs child Samplers and keeps running until the condition in the condition field becomes false. Transaction controller- The Transaction Controller in JMeter is a useful tool for organising and determining how diﬀerent pieces of your test will appear in a report. The Transaction Controller creates a second sample that measures the total time it takes to complete the nested test items. Loop controller- The Loop Controller causes the user request to be repeated a given number of times or to be repeated indefinitely. Simple controller- Simple Controller is a container for user requests. Module controller- Module Controller's purpose is to make JMeter more modular. Web applications, in general, are made up of small functional units (e.g., login, create account, logoﬀ...). This capability can be saved as ""modules"" in Simple Controller. The Module Controller will determine which module is required to run. Random Controller-In each loop period, the Random Controller causes all user requests to be processed in a random sequence. Interleave Controller- Interleave Controller takes one of the user requests and makes it run in each loop of the thread."
"Pandas Interview Questions Pandas is an open-source Python package that is most commonly used for data science, data analysis, and machine learning tasks. It is built on top of another library named Numpy. It provides various data structures and operations for manipulating numerical data and time series and is very eﬀicient in performing various functions like data visualization, data manipulation, data analysis, etc."
"2. Mention the diﬀerent types of Data Structures in Pandas? Pandas have three diﬀerent types of data structures. It is due to these simple and flexible data structures that it is fast and eﬀicient. Series - It is a one-dimensional array-like structure with homogeneous data which means data of diﬀerent data types cannot be a part of the same series. It can hold any data type such as integers, floats, and strings and its values are mutable i.e. it can be changed but the size of the series is immutable i.e. it cannot be changed. DataFrame - It is a two-dimensional array-like structure with heterogeneous data. It can contain data of diﬀerent data types and the data is aligned in a tabular manner. Both size and values of DataFrame are mutable. Panel - The Pandas have a third type of data structure known as Panel, which is a 3D data structure capable of storing heterogeneous data but it isn’t that widely used."
"3. What are the significant features of the pandas Library? Pandas library is known for its eﬀicient data analysis and state-of-the-art data visualization. The key features of the panda’s library are as follows: Pandas Interview Questions Fast and eﬀicient DataFrame object with default and customized indexing. High-performance merging and joining of data. Data alignment and integrated handling of missing data. Label-based slicing, indexing, and subsetting of large data sets. Reshaping and pivoting of data sets. Tools for loading data into in-memory data objects from diﬀerent file formats. Columns from a data structure can be deleted or inserted. Group by data for aggregation and transformations. Time Series functionality."
"4. Define Series in Pandas? It is a one-dimensional array-like structure with homogeneous data which means data of diﬀerent data types cannot be a part of the same series. It can hold any data type such as integers, floats, and strings and its values are mutable i.e. it can be changed but the size of the series is immutable i.e. it cannot be changed. By using a ‘series’ method, we can easily convert the list, tuple, and dictionary into a series. A Series cannot contain multiple columns."
"5. Define DataFrame in Pandas? It is a two-dimensional array-like structure with heterogeneous data. It can contain data of diﬀerent data types and the data is aligned in a tabular manner i.e. in rows and columns and the indexes with respect to these are called row index and column index respectively. Both size and values of DataFrame are mutable. The columns can be heterogeneous types like int and bool. It can also be defined as a dictionary of Series. The syntax for creating a dataframe: import pandas as pd dataframe = pd.DataFrame( data, index, columns, dtype) Here: Pandas Interview Questions data - It represents various forms like series, map, ndarray, lists, dict, etc. index - It is an optional argument that represents an index to row labels. columns - Optional argument for column labels. Dtype - It represents the data type of each column. It is an optional parameter."
"6. What are the diﬀerent ways in which a series can be created? There are diﬀerent ways of creating a series in Pandas. Creating an empty Series: The simplest series that can be created is an empty series. The Series() function of Pandas is used to create a series of any kind. Code Example 1: # import pandas as pd import pandas as pd # Creating empty Series ser = pd.Series() print(ser) Output: Series([], dtype: float64) Creating a series from an array: Pandas is built on top of the Numpy library. In order to create a series from the NumPy array, we have to import the NumPy module and have to use numpy.array() the function. Code Example 2: Pandas Interview Questions # import pandas as pd import pandas as pd # import numpy as np import numpy as np # simple array data = np.array(['s', 'c', 'a', 'l', 'a','r']) ser = pd.Series(data) print(ser) Output: 0 s 1 c 2 a 3 l 4 a 5 r dtype: object Creating a series from the array with an index: In order to create a series by exclusively providing an index instead of the default value we need to provide a list of elements to the index parameter with the same number of elements as given in the array. Code Example 3: # import pandas as pd import pandas as pd # import numpy as np import numpy as np # simple array data = np.array(['s', 'c', 'a', 'l', 'a','r']) # providing an index ser = pd.Series(data, index=[10, 11, 12, 13, 14,15]) print(ser) Pandas Interview Questions Output: 10 s 11 c 12 a 13 l 14 a 15 r dtype: object Creating a series from Lists: In order to create a series from a list, the first step is to create a list, and then we need to create a series from the given list. Code Example 4: import pandas as pd # a simple list list = ['s', 'c', 'a', 'l', 'a','r'] # create series form a list ser = pd.Series(list) print(ser) Output: 0 s 1 c 2 a 3 l 4 a 5 r dtype: object Creating a series from Dictionary: In order to create a series from the dictionary, the first step is to create a dictionary, and only then we can create a series using. The dictionary keys serve as indexes for the Series. Code Example 5: Pandas Interview Questions import pandas as pd # a simple dictionary dict = {'A': 101, 'B': 202, 'C': 303} # create series from dictionary ser = pd.Series(dict) print(ser) Output: A 101 B 202 C 303 dtype: int64 Creating a series from Scalar value: In order to create a series from scalar value, an index must be provided. The value repeats itself to fit the length of the series or index given in general. Code Example 6: import pandas as pd import numpy as np # giving a scalar value with index ser = pd.Series(10, index=[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) print(ser) Output: Pandas Interview Questions 0 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 10 dtype: int64"
"7. What are the diﬀerent ways in which a dataframe can be created? Creating an empty dataframe: A basic DataFrame, which can be created is an Empty Dataframe. An Empty Dataframe is created just by calling a pandas.DataFrame() constructor. Code Example : # Importing Pandas to create DataFrame import pandas as pd # Creating Empty DataFrame and Storing it in variable df df = pd.DataFrame() # Printing Empty DataFrame print(df) Output: Empty DataFrame Columns: [] Index: [] Creating a dataframe using List: DataFrame can be created using a single list or by using a list of lists. Code Example : Pandas Interview Questions # Import pandas library import pandas as pd # initialize list elements data = [110,202,303,404,550,650] # Create the pandas DataFrame with the column name provided explicitly df = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=['Amounts']) # print dataframe. print(df) Output: Amounts 0 110 1 202 2 303 3 404 4 550 5 650 Code Example : # Import pandas library import pandas as pd # initialize list of lists data = [['mark', 20], ['zack', 16], ['ron', 24]] # Create the pandas DataFrame df = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=['Name', 'Age']) # print dataframe. print(df) Output: Name Age 0 mark 20 1 zack 16 2 ron 24 Pandas Interview Questions Creating DataFrame from dict of ndarray/lists: To create a DataFrame from dict of narray/list there are a few conditions to be met. First, all the arrays must be of the same length. Second, if the index is passed then the length index should be equal to the length of arrays. Third, if no index is passed, then by default, the index will be in the range(n) where n is the length of the array. Code Example : # Python code demonstrates creating # DataFrame from dict narray / lists # By default addresses. import pandas as pd # initialize data of lists. data = {'Name': ['Max', 'Lara', 'Koke', 'muller'], 'Age': [10, 31, 91, 48]} # Create DataFrame df = pd.DataFrame(data) # Print the output. print(df) Output: Name Age 0 Max 10 1 Lara 31 2 Koke 91 3 muller 48 Create pandas dataframe from lists using a dictionary: Creating pandas DataFrame from lists using a dictionary can be achieved in multiple ways. We can create pandas DataFrame from lists using a dictionary by using pandas.DataFrame(). Code Example : Pandas Interview Questions # Python code demonstrates how to create # Pandas DataFrame by lists of dicts. import pandas as pd # Initialize data to lists. data = [{'aa': 1, 'bs': 2, 'cd': 3}, {'aa': 10, 'bs': 20, 'cd': 30}] # Creates DataFrame. df = pd.DataFrame(data) # Print the data print(df) Output: aa bs cd 0 1 2 3 1 10 20 30 Creating dataframe from series: In order to create a dataframe using series the argument to be passed in a DataFrame() function has to be a Series. Code Example: # Python code demonstrates creating # Pandas Dataframe from series. import pandas as pd # Initialize data to series. d = pd.Series([10, 20, 30, 40]) # creates Dataframe. df = pd.DataFrame(d) # print the data. print(df) Output: Pandas Interview Questions 0 0 10 1 20 2 30 3 40 Creating DataFrame from Dictionary of series: To create a DataFrame from Dict of series, a dictionary needs to be passed as an argument to form a DataFrame. The resultant index is the union of all the series of passed indexed. Code Example : # Python code demonstrate creating # Pandas Dataframe from Dicts of series. import pandas as pd # Initialize data to Dicts of series. d = {'one': pd.Series([10, 20, 30, 40], index=['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']), 'two': pd.Series([10, 20, 30, 40], index=['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'])} # creates Dataframe. df = pd.DataFrame(d) # print the data. print(df) Output: one two a 10 10 b 20 20 c 30 30 d 40 40"
"8. How can we create a copy of the series in Pandas? We can create a copy of the series by using the following syntax: Series.copy(deep=True) Pandas Interview Questions The default value for the deep parameter is set to True. When the value ofdeep=True, the creation of a new object with a copy of the calling object’s data and indices takes place. Modifications to the data or indices of the copy will not be reflected in the original object whereas when the value of deep=False, the creation of a new object will take place without copying the calling object’s data or index i.e. only the references to the data and index will be copied. Any changes made to the data of the original object will be reflected in the shallow copy and vice versa."
"9. Explain Categorical data in Pandas? Categorical data is a discrete set of values for a particular outcome and has a fixed range. Also, the data in the category need not be numerical, it can be textual in nature. Examples are gender, social class, blood type, country aﬀiliation, observation time, etc. There is no hard and fast rule for how many values a categorical value should have. One should apply one’s domain knowledge to make that determination on the data sets."
"10. Explain Reindexing in pandas along with its parameters? Reindexing as the name suggests is used to alter the rows and columns in a DataFrame. It is also defined as the process of conforming a dataframe to a new index with optional filling logic. For missing values in a dataframe, the reindex() method assigns NA/NaN as the value. A new object is returned unless a new index is produced that is equivalent to the current one. The copy value is set to False. This is also used for changing the index of rows and columns in the dataframe."
"11. What is NumPy? NumPy is one of the most widely used, versatile, simple, open-source, python-based, general-purpose packages that is used for processing arrays. NumPy is an abbreviation for NUMerical PYthon. Due to its highly optimized tools, it provides high-performance and powerful N-dimensional array processing capabilities that are explicitly designed to handle complex arrays. It is most commonly used in performing scientific computations and various broadcasting functions because of its popularity, powerful performance, and flexibility to perform various operations. Pandas Interview Questions"
12. Give a brief description of time series in Panda? A time series is an organized collection of data that depicts the evolution of a quantity through time. Pandas have a wide range of capabilities and tools for working with time-series data in all fields. Supported by pandas: Analyzing time-series data from a variety of sources and formats. Create time and date sequences with preset frequencies. Date and time manipulation and conversion with timezone information. A time series is resampled or converted to a specific frequency. Calculating dates and times using absolute or relative time increments is one way to.
"13. Explain MultiIndexing in Pandas. Multiple indexing is defined as essential indexing because it deals with data analysis and manipulation, especially for working with higher dimensional data. It also enables us to store and manipulate data with an arbitrary number of dimensions in lower-dimensional data structures like Series and DataFrame."
14. How can we convert Series to DataFrame? The conversion of Series to DataFrame is quite a simple process. All we need to do is to use the to_frame() function. Syntax: Series.to_frame(name=None) Parameters: name: It accepts data objects as input. It is an optional parameter. The value of the name parameter will be equal to the name of the Series if it has any. Return Type: It returns the DataFrame a
"15. How can we convert DataFrame to Numpy Array? In order to convert DataFrame to a Numpy array we need to use DataFrame.to_numpy() method. Pandas Interview Questions Syntax: DataFrame.to_numpy(dtype=None, copy=False, na_value=_NoDefault.no_default) Parameters: dtype: It accepts string or numpy.dtype. It is an optional parameter. copy: It accepts a boolean value whose default is set to False. na_value: It is an optional parameter. It specifies the value to use for missing values. The data type will depend on the data type of the column in the dataframe."
"16. How can we convert DataFrame to an excel file? In order to convert DataFrame to an excel file we need to use the to_excel() function. There are various parameters to be considered. But initially, all you need is to mention the DataFrame name and the name of the excel sheet. Note: To write a single object to an Excel file, you need to provide the target file name. However, if you want to write to multiple sheets, you must create an ExcelWriter object that specifies the target file name and the sheet that needs to be written. Alternatively, you can specify a unique sheet name to write multiple sheets to the same Excel file. Syntax: data.to_excel( excel_writer, sheet_name='Sheet1', \\*\\*kwargs ) Parameters: Pandas Interview Questions excel_writer: It accepts a string or ExcelWriter object. It specifies the path of the file to be written or an existing ExcelWriter object. sheet_name: It accepts a string value. The default value is set to ‘Sheet1’. It specifies the name of the sheet that will contain the DataFrame. columns: It accepts a sequence or list of strings as input. It is an optional parameter that specifies the columns that need to be written. index: It accepts a boolean value whose default is set to True. It specifies the rows/index to be written. index_label: It accepts string or sequence of string values. It is an optional parameter. It specifies the column label for index column(s) if required. If nothing is specified, and the header and index are set to True, then the index names are used. A sequence value should be given only if the DataFrame uses MultiIndexing."
"17. What is TimeDelta? Timedeltas are diﬀerences in times, expressed in diﬀerent units, e.g. days, hours, minutes, and seconds. They can be both positive and negative."
18. Explain Pandas Timedelta.seconds Property Timedelta.seconds in pandas is used to return the number of seconds. Its implementation is simpler than it sounds. We do not need any special parameters and the return type is in the form of seconds. Code Example : #importing necessary libraries import pandas as pd import numpy as np # Create the Timedelta object td = pd.Timedelta('5 days 09:08:03.000000312') # Print the Timedelta object print(td) # Print the Timedelta object in seconds format print(td.seconds) Pandas Interview Questions Output:- 5 days 09:08:03.000000312 32883 Pandas Interview Questions for Experienced
"19. Is iterating over a Pandas Dataframe a good practice? If not what are the important conditions to keep in mind before iterating? Ideally, iterating over pandas DataFrames is definitely not the best practice and one should only consider doing so when it is absolutely necessary and no other function is applicable. The iteration process through DataFrames is very ineﬀicient. Pandas provide a lot of functions using which an operation can be executed without iterating through the dataframe. There are certain conditions that need to be checked before Before attempting to iterate through pandas objects, we must first ensure that none of the below-stated conditions aligns with our use case: Applying a function to rows: A common use case of iteration is when it comes to applying a function to every row, which is designed to work only one row at a time and cannot be applied on the full DataFrame or Series. In such cases, it’s always recommended to use apply() method instead of iterating through the pandas object. Iterative manipulations: In case we need to perform iterative manipulations and at the same time performance is a major area of concern, then we have alternatives like numba and cython. Printing a DataFrame: If we want to print out a DataFrame then instead of iterating through the whole DataFrame we can simply use DataFrame.to_string() method in order to render the DataFrame to a console- friendly tabular output. Vectorisation over iteration: It is always preferred to choose vectorization over iteration as pandas come with a rich set of built-in methods whose performance is highly optimized and super eﬀicient. Pandas Interview Questions"
"20. How would you iterate over rows in a DataFrame in Pandas? Although it is not a good practice to iterate over rows in Pandas if there is no other alternative we do so using either iterrows() or itertuples() built-in methods. pandas.DataFrame.iterrows(): This method is used to iterate over DataFrame rows as (index, Series) pairs. There is only one drawback for this method it does not preserve the dtypes across rows due to the fact that it converts each row into a Series. If you need to preserve the dtypes of the pandas object, then one should use itertuples() method instead. Code Example : # import pandas package as pd import pandas as pd # Define a dictionary containing students data data = {'Name': ['Sneha', 'Shreya', 'Sabhya', 'Riya'], 'Age': [22, 18, 10, 19], 'Stream': ['Computer', 'Commerce', 'Arts', 'Mechanical'], 'Percentage': [89, 93, 97, 73]} # Convert the dictionary into DataFrame df = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=['Name', 'Age', 'Stream', 'Percentage']) print(""Given Dataframe :\\n"", df) print(""\\nIterating over rows using iterrows() method :\\n"") # iterate through each row and select # 'Name' and 'Age' columns respectively. for index, row in df.iterrows(): print(row[""Name""], row[""Age""]) Output:- Pandas Interview Questions Given Dataframe : Name Age Stream Percentage 0 Sneha 22 Computer 89 1 Shreya 18 Commerce 93 2 Sabhya 10 Arts 97 3 Riya 19 Mechanical 73 Iterating over rows using iterrows() method : Sneha 22 Shreya 18 Sabhya 10 Riya 19 pandas.DataFrame.itertuples(): This method is used to iterate over DataFrame rows as namedtuples. Also, itertuples() are faster than compared to iterrows(). Code Example : print(""\\nIterating over rows using itertuples() method :\\n"") # iterate through each row and select # 'Name' and 'Percentage' column respectively. for row in df.itertuples(index=True, name='Pandas'): print(getattr(row, ""Name""), getattr(row, ""Percentage"")) Output:- Iterating over rows using itertuples() method : Sneha 89 Shreya 93 Sabhya 97 Riya 73"
21. List some statistical functions in Python Pandas? Some of the major statistical functions in Python Pandas are: Pandas Interview Questions sum() – It returns the sum of the values. min() – It returns the minimum value. max() – It returns the maximum value. abs() – It returns the absolute value. mean() – It returns the mean which is the average of the values. std() – It returns the standard deviation of the numerical columns. prod() – It returns the product of the values.
"22. How to Read Text Files with Pandas? There are multiple ways in which we read a text file using Pandas. Using read_csv(): CSV is a comma-separated file i.e. any text file that uses commas as a delimiter to separate the record values for each field. Therefore, in order to load data from a text file we use pandas.read_csv() method. Using read_table(): This function is very much like the read_csv() function, the major diﬀerence being that in read_table the delimiter value is ‘\\t’ and not a comma which is the default value for read_csv(). We will read data with the read_table function making the separator equal to a single space(‘ ‘). Using read_fwf(): It stands for fixed-width lines. This function is used to load DataFrames from files. Another very interesting feature is that it supports optionally iterating or breaking the file into chunks. Since the columns in the text file were separated with a fixed width, this read_fwf() read the contents eﬀectively into separate columns."
"23. How are iloc() and loc() diﬀerent? DataFrame.iloc(): It is a method used to retrieve data from a Data frame, and it is an integer position-based locator (from 0 to length-1 of the axis), but may also be used with a boolean array and this is the major diﬀerence factor between iloc() and loc(). It takes input as integers, arrays of integers, an object, boolean arrays, and functions. Code Example : Pandas Interview Questions Output:- Name Age Marks 0 Kate 10 85 2 Sheila 12 91 DataFrame.loc(): It gets rows or columns with particular labels as input. It takes input as a single label, a list of arrays, and objects with labels. It does not work with boolean arrays or values. Code Example : Output:- Name Age Marks 0 Kate 10 85 1 Harry 14 77 2 Sheila 12 91 Name Age Marks 0 Kate 10 85"
"24. How will you sort a DataFrame? import pandas as pd student_dict = {'Name': ['Kate', 'Harry', 'Sheila'], 'Age': [10, 14, 12], 'Marks': [85, # create DataFrame from dict df = pd.DataFrame(student_dict) print(df) print(df.iloc[[0, 2]]) import pandas as pd student_dict = {'Name': ['Kate', 'Harry', 'Sheila'], 'Age': [10, 14, 12], 'Marks': [85, # create DataFrame from dict df = pd.DataFrame(student_dict) print(df) print(df.loc[(df.Name=='Kate')]) Pandas Interview Questions The function used for sorting in pandas is called DataFrame.sort_values(). It is used to sort a DataFrame by its column or row values. The function comes with a lot of parameters, but the most important ones to consider for sort are: by: It is used to specify the column/row(s) which are used to determine the sorted order. It is an optional parameter. axis: It specifies whether the sorting is to be performed for a row or column and the value is 0 and 1 respectively. ascending: It specifies whether to sort the dataframe in ascending or descending order. The default value is set to ascending. If the value is set as ascending=False it will sort in descending order."
"25. How would you convert continuous values into discrete values in Pandas? Depending on the problem, continuous values can be discretized using the cut() or qcut() function: cut() It bins the data based on values. We use it when we need to segment and sort data values into bins that are evenly spaced. cut() will choose the bins to be evenly spaced based on the values themselves and not the frequency of those values. For example, cut could convert ages to groups of age ranges. qcut() bins the data based on sample quantiles. We use it when we want to have the same number of records in each bin or simply study the data by quantiles. For example, if in a data we have 30 records, and we want to compute the quintiles, qcut() will divide the data such that we have 6 records in each bin."
"26. What is the diﬀerence between join() and merge() in Pandas? Both join and merge functions are used to combine two dataframes. The major diﬀerence is that the join method combines two dataframes on the basis of their indexes whereas the merge method is more flexible and allows us to specify columns along with the index to combine the two dataframes. Pandas Interview Questions These are the main diﬀerences between df.join() and df.merge(): lookup on right table: When performing a lookup on the right table, the join() method will always use the index of df2 to perform the join operation. However, if you use the merge() method, you can choose to join based on one or more columns of df2 by default, or even the index of df2 if you specify the right_index=True parameter. lookup on le"
"27. What is the diﬀerence(s) between merge() and concat() in Pandas? Both concat and merge functions are used to combine dataframes. There are three major key diﬀerences between these two functions. Pandas Interview Questions The Way of Combining: concat() function concatenates dataframes along rows or columns. It is nothing but stacking up of multiple dataframes whereas merge() combines dataframes based on values in shared columns thus it is more flexible compared to concat() as the combination can happen based on the given condition. Axis parameter: concat() function has axis parameter. Since merge() function combines dataframes on the basis of shared columns side by side it does not really need an axis parameter. The value of the axis parameter decides in what direction will the concatenation happen. For it to happen row-wise the value of the axis parameter will be ‘0’ and for it to happen side-by-side it will be ‘1’. The default value is 1. Join vs How: Join is a parameter of concat() function and how is a parameter of merge() function. Join can take two values outer and inner whereas how can take four values inner, outer, le"
"28. What’s the diﬀerence between interpolate() and fillna() in Pandas? fillna(): It fills the NaN values with a given number with which you want to substitute. It gives you the option to fill according to the index of rows of a pd.DataFrame or on the name of the columns in the form of a python dict. Code Example : import pandas as pd import numpy as np #Creating a dataframe df = pd.DataFrame({""Value_1"":[None, 14, 35, None, 1,12, 74, 65, None, 1], ""Value_2"":[None, 24, 54, 3, None,None, 2, 54, 3, None], ""Value_3"":[20, 16, None, 3, 8,None, 2, 54, 3, None], ""Value_4"":[None, 2, 54, 3, None,14, 3, None, None, 6]}) print(df) #Fill the missing value with average values in column Value1. df['Value_1'].fillna(int(df13['Value_1'].mean()), inplace = True) df.head() Pandas Interview Questions Output: Value_1 Value_2 Value_3 Value_4 0 NaN NaN 20.0 NaN 1 14.0 24.0 16.0 2.0 2 35.0 54.0 NaN 54.0 3 NaN 3.0 3.0 3.0 4 1.0 NaN 8.0 NaN 5 12.0 NaN NaN 14.0 6 74.0 2.0 2.0 3.0 7 65.0 54.0 54.0 NaN 8 NaN 3.0 3.0 NaN 9 1.0 NaN NaN 6.0 # after using fillna method.

"32. How can we convert DataFrame into a NumPy array? In order to convert a dataframe into a NumPy array we use DataFrame.to_numpy() method. Syntax: DataFrame.to_numpy(dtype=None, copy=False, na_value=_NoDefault.no_default) Parameters: dtype: It accepts string or numpy.dtype value. It is an optional parameter. copy: It accepts a boolean value. The default value is set to False. It ensures that the returned value is not a view on another array. Setting the value of copy=False does not ensure that to_numpy() is no-copy. Whereas if copy=True it does ensure that a copy is made. na_value: It accepts the parameter of any datatype and it is an optional parameter. It specifies the value to be used for missing values. The default value is of the same data type as the object.

Code Example : #importing necessary libraries import pandas as pd import numpy as np #Conversion from string format to date format takes place using Timedelta method. print (pd.Timedelta('20 days 12 hours 45 minutes 3 seconds')) Output: Pandas Interview Questions 20 days 12:45:03 *Integer: What diﬀers from string, in this case, is we just need to pass an integer value and the object will be created. Code Example : #importing necessary libraries import pandas as pd import numpy as np print (pd.Timedelta(16,unit='h'))#h here is used for hours. Output: 0 days 16:00:00 Data Oﬀsets: In order to first learn how to create a timedelta object using data oﬀset we first need to understand what data oﬀset actually is. Data oﬀsets are parameters like weeks, days, hours, minutes, seconds, milliseconds, microseconds, and nanoseconds. This when passed as an argument helps in the creation of the timedelta object. Code Example : #importing necessary libraries import pandas as pd import numpy as np print (pd.Timedelta(days=2, hours = 16)) Output:- 2 days 16:00:00 Code Example : Pandas Interview Questions #importing necessary libraries import pandas as pd import numpy as np print (pd.Timedelta(days=2, hours = 6, minutes = 23)) Output:- 2 days 06:23:00"
"35. How do you split a DataFrame according to a boolean criterion? We can create a mask to separate the dataframe and then use the inverse operator (~) to take the complement of the mask.

"42. How can you find the row for which the value of a specific column is max or min? We can find the row for which the value of a specific column is by using idxmax and idxmin functions. Code Example : import pandas as pd data = { ""sales"": [23, 34, 56], ""age"": [50, 40, 30] } df = pd.DataFrame(data) print(df.idxmax()) print(df.idxmin()) Output:- sales 2 age 0 dtype: int64 sales 0 age 2 dtype: int64"
43. Explain the GroupBy function in Pandas Pandas Interview Questions Python pandas Dataframe.groupby() function is used for grouping the data according to the categories and applying a function to those categories. It helps in data aggregation in an eﬀicient manner. It splits the data into groups based on some given criteria. The pandas objects can be split on any of their axes. In brief groupby() provides the mapping of labels to their respective group names. Syntax: Code Example : Output:- Name Age Marks 0 Kate 10 85 1 Harry 14 77 2 Sheila 12 91 Name Marks Age 10 Kate 85 12 Sheila 91 14 Harry 77
"44. How to format data in your Pandas DataFrame? DataFrame.groupby(by=None, axis=0, level=None, as_index=True, sort=True, group_keys=_No import pandas as pd student_dict = {'Name': ['Kate', 'Harry', 'Sheila'], 'Age': [10, 14, 12], 'Marks': [85, # create DataFrame from dict df = pd.DataFrame(student_dict) print(df) gk = df.groupby('Age') gk.first() Pandas Interview Questions When we start working on a dataset or a set of data we need to perform some operations on the values in the DataFrame. At times these values might not be in the right format for you to work on it thus formatting of data is required. There are multiple ways in which we can format data in a Pandas DataFrame. One way is by Replacing All Occurrences of a String in a DataFrame. In order to replace Strings in our DataFrame, we can use replace() method i.e. all we need is to pass the values that we would like to change, followed by the values we want to replace them with. One other way is by Removing Parts From Strings in the Cells of the DataFrame. Removing unwanted parts of strings is cumbersome work. Luckily, there is a solution in place! We can do it easily by using map() function on the column result to apply the lambda function over each element or element-wise of the column. Splitting Text in a Column into Multiple Rows in a DataFrame. The process of splitting text into multiple rows is quite a complex task. We can do so by applying a function to the Pandas DataFrame’s Columns or Rows."
"45. What is the use of pandas.Dataframe.aggregate() function? Explain its syntax and parameters. Data Aggregation is defined as the process of applying some aggregation function to one or more columns. It uses the following: sum: It is used to return the sum of the values for the requested axis. min: It is used to return a minimum of the values for the requested axis. max: It is used to return maximum values for the requested axis. Its Syntax is: DataFrame.aggregate(func=None, axis=0, *args, **kwargs) Aggregate using one or more operations over the specified axis. Parameters: Pandas Interview Questions func: It takes string, list, dictionary, or function values as input. It represents the function to use for data aggregation. axis: It takes in only two values ‘0’ or ‘1’. 0 is for the index and 1 is for columns. If 0 or ‘index’: The function is applied to each column. If 1 or ‘columns’: The function is applied to each row. The default value is set to 0. It returns the aggregated dataframe as the output. Code Example : import pandas as pd data = { ""x"": [560, 240, 630], ""y"": [300, 1112, 452] } df = pd.DataFrame(data) x = df.aggregate([""sum""]) y = df.aggregate([""min""]) z = df.aggregate([""max""]) print(x) print(y) print(z) Output: x y sum 1430 1864 x y min 240 300 x y max 630 1112"
"46. How to get items of series A not present in series B? In order to find items from series A that are not present in series B by using the isin() method combining it with the Bitwise NOT operator in pandas. We can understand this using a code example: Pandas Interview Questions Code Example : # Importing pandas library import pandas as pd # Creating 2 pandas Series series1 = pd.Series([12, 24, 38, 210, 110, 147, 929]) series2 = pd.Series([17, 83, 76, 54, 110, 929, 510]) print(""Series1:"") print(series1) print(""\\nSeries2:"") print(series2) # Using Bitwise NOT operator along # with pandas.isin() print(""\\nItems of series1 not present in series2:"") res = series1[~series1.isin(series2)] print(res) Output:- Pandas Interview Questions Series1: 0 12 1 24 2 38 3 210 4 110 5 147 6 929 dtype: int64 Series2: 0 17 1 83 2 76 3 54 4 110 5 929 6 510 dtype: int64 Items of series1 not present in series2: 0 12 1 24 2 38 3 210 5 147 dtype: int64"
"47. Describe a few data operations in Pandas. There are several useful data operations for DataFrame in Pandas, which are as follows: Pandas Interview Questions"
"1. String Operation: Pandas provide a set of string functions for working with string data. The following are the few operations on string data: lower(): Any strings in the index or series are converted to lowercase letters. upper(): Any strings in the index or series are converted to uppercase letters. strip(): This method eliminates spacing from every string in the Series/index, along with a new line. islower(): If all of the characters in the Series/Index string are lowercase, it returns True. Otherwise, False is returned. isupper(): If all of the characters in the Series/Index string are uppercase, it returns True. Otherwise, False is returned. split(’ '): It’s a method that separates a string according to a pattern. cat(sep=’ '): With a defined separator, it concatenates series/index items. contains(pattern): If a substring is available in the current element, it returns True; otherwise, it returns False. replace(a,b): It substitutes the value b for the value a. startswith(pattern): If all of the components in the series begin with a pattern, it returns True. endswith(pattern): If all of the components in the series terminate in a pattern, it returns True. find(pattern): It can be used to return the pattern’s first occurrence. findall(pattern): It gives you a list of all the times the pattern appears. swapcase: It is used to switch the lower/upper case."
"2. Null values: When no data is being sent to the items, a Null value/missing value can appear. There may be no values in the respective columns, which are commonly represented as NaN. Pandas provide several useful functions for identifying, deleting, and changing null values in Data Frames. The following are the functions. isnull(): isnull 's job is to return true if either of the rows has null values. notnull(): It is the inverse of the isnull() function, returning true values for non-null values. dropna(): This function evaluates and removes null values from rows and columns. fillna(): It enables users to substitute other values for the NaN values. replace(): It’s a powerful function that can take the role of a regex, dictionary, string, series, and more. Pandas Interview Questions"
"48. Compare the Pandas methods: map(), applymap(), apply() The map() method is an elementwise method for only Pandas Series, it maps values of the Series according to input correspondence. It accepts dicts, Series, or callable. Values that are not found in the dict are converted to NaN. Code Example: We first create a dataframe and then apply the respective methods to it. import pandas as pd # Series generation str_string = 'scalar' str_series = pd.Series(list(str_string)) print(""Original series\\n"" + str_series.to_string(index=False, header=False), end='\\n\\n') # Using apply method for converting characters # present in the original series new_str_series = str_series.map(str.upper) print(""Transformed series:\\n"" + new_str_series.to_string(index=False, header=False), end='\\n\\n') Output: Original series s c a l a r Transformed series: S C A L A R Pandas Interview Questions The applymap() method is an elementwise function for only DataFrames, it applies a function that accepts and returns a scalar to every element of a DataFrame. It accepts callables only i.e. a Python function. Code Example : import pandas as pd # initialize a dataframe df = pd.DataFrame( [['a', 'b', 'c'], ['d','e','f'], ], columns=['X', 'Y', 'Z']) print(df) new_df = df.applymap(str.upper) print(""Transformed dataframe:\\n"" + new_df.to_string(index=False, header=False), end='\\n\\n') Output:- X Y Z 0 a b c 1 d e f Transformed dataframe: A B D E F The apply() method also works elementwise, as it applies a function along the input axis of DataFrame. It is suited to more complex operations and aggregation. It accepts the callables parameter as well. Code Example : Pandas Interview Questions import pandas as pd # initialize a dataframe df = pd.DataFrame( [[10, 12, 33], [41, 53, 66], [17, 81, 19], [10, 11, 12]], columns=['X', 'Y', 'Z']) print(df) new_df = df.apply(lambda x:x.sort_values(), axis = 1) print(""Transformed dataframe:\\n"" + \\ new_df.to_string(index = False, header = False), end = '\\n\\n') Output:- X Y Z 0 10 12 33 1 41 53 66 2 17 81 19 3 10 11 12 Transformed dataframe: 10 12 33 41 53 66 17 81 19 10 11 12"
"49. What’s the diﬀerence between pivot_table() and groupby()? Both pivot_table() and groupby() are used to aggregate your dataframe. The major diﬀerence is in the shape of the result. Code Example: Pandas Interview Questions Output:- Name Age Marks 0 Kate 10 85 1 Harry 14 77 2 Sheila 12 91 Marks Name Age Harry 14 77 Kate 10 85 Sheila 12 91 Code Example : Output: import pandas as pd student_dict = {'Name': ['Kate', 'Harry', 'Sheila'], 'Age': [10, 14, 12], 'Marks': [85, # create DataFrame from dict df = pd.DataFrame(student_dict) print(df) table = pd.pivot_table(df, index =['Name', 'Age']) print(table) import pandas as pd student_dict = {'Name': ['Kate', 'Harry', 'Sheila'], 'Age': [10, 14, 12], 'Marks': [85, # create DataFrame from dict df = pd.DataFrame(student_dict) print(df) gk = df.groupby('Age') gk.first() Pandas Interview Questions Name Age Marks 0 Kate 10 85 1 Harry 14 77 2 Sheila 12 91 Age Name Marks 10 Kate 85 12 Sheila 91 14 Harry 77"

"2. What are the advantages of using CSS? The main advantages of CSS are given below: Separation of content from presentation - CSS provides a way to present the same content in multiple presentation formats in mobile or desktop or laptop. Easy to maintain - CSS, built eﬀectively can be used to change the look and feel complete by making small changes. To make a global change, simply change the style, and all elements in all the web pages will be updated automatically. Bandwidth - Used eﬀectively, the style sheets will be stored in the browser cache and they can be used on multiple pages, without having to download again."
"3. What are the limitations of CSS? CSS Interview Questions Disadvantages of CSS are given below: Browser Compatibility: Some style selectors are supported and some are not. We have to determine which style is supported or not using the @support selector). Cross Browser issue: Some selectors behave diﬀerently in a diﬀerent browser). There is no parent selector: Currently, Using CSS, you can’t select a parent tag."
"4. How to include CSS in the webpage? There are diﬀerent ways to include a CSS in a webpage, 1 - External Style Sheet: An external file linked to your HTML document: Using link tag, we can link the style sheet to the HTML page. <link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyles.css"" /> 2 - Embed CSS with a style tag: A set of CSS styles included within your HTML page. <style type=""text/css""> /*Add style rules here*/ </style> Add your CSS rules between the opening and closing style tags and write your CSS exactly the same way as you do in stand-alone stylesheet files. 3 - Add inline styles to HTML elements(CSS rules applied directly within an HTML tag.): Style can be added directly to the HTML element using a style tag. <h2 style=""color:red;background:black"">Inline Style</h2> 4 - Import a stylesheet file (An external file imported into another CSS file): Another way to add CSS is by using the @import rule. This is to add a new CSS file within CSS itself. CSS Interview Questions @import ""path/to/style.css"";"
"5. What are the diﬀerent types of Selectors in CSS? A CSS selector is the part of a CSS ruleset that actually selects the content you want to style. Diﬀerent types of selectors are listed below. Universal Selector: The universal selector works like a wildcard character, selecting all elements on a page. In the given example, the provided styles will get applied to all the elements on the page. * { color: ""green""; font-size: 20px; line-height: 25px; } Element Type Selector: This selector matches one or more HTML elements of the same name. In the given example, the provided styles will get applied to all the ul elements on the page. ul { line-style: none; border: solid 1px #ccc; } ID Selector: This selector matches any HTML element that has an ID attribute with the same value as that of the selector. In the given example, the provided styles will get applied to all the elements having ID as a container on the page. #container { width: 960px; margin: 0 auto; } <div id=""container""></div> CSS Interview Questions Class Selector: The class selector also matches all elements on the page that have their class attribute set to the same value as the class. In the given example, the provided styles will get applied to all the elements having ID as the box on the page. .box { padding: 10px; margin: 10px; width: 240px; } <div class=""box""></div> Descendant Combinator: The descendant selector or, more accurately, the descendant combinator lets you combine two or more selectors so you can be more specific in your selection method. #container .box { float: left; padding-bottom: 15px; } <div id=""container""> <div class=""box""></div> <div class=""box-2""></div> </div> <div class=”box”></div> This declaration block will apply to all elements that have a class of box that is inside an element with an ID of the container. It’s worth noting that the .box element doesn’t have to be an immediate child: there could be another element wrapping .box, and the styles would still apply. Child Combinator: A selector that uses the child combinator is similar to a selector that uses a descendant combinator, except it only targets immediate child elements. CSS Interview Questions #container> .box { float: left; padding-bottom: 15px; } <div id=""container""> <div class=""box""></div> <div> <div class=""box""></div> </div> </div> The selector will match all elements that have a class of box and that are immediate children of the #container element. That means, unlike the descendant combinator, there can’t be another element wrapping .box it has to be a direct child element. General Sibling Combinator: A selector that uses a general sibling combinator to match elements based on sibling relationships. The selected elements are beside each other in the HTML. h2 ~ p { margin-bottom: 20px; } <h2>Title</h2> <p>Paragraph example.</p> <p>Paragraph example.</p> <p>Paragraph example.</p> <div class=”box”> <p>Paragraph example.</p> </div> In this example, all paragraph elements (<p>) will be styled with the specified rules, but only if they are siblings of <h2> elements. There could be other elements in between the <h2> and <p>, and the styles would still apply. CSS Interview Questions Adjacent Sibling Combinator: A selector that uses the adjacent sibling combinator uses the plus symbol (+), and is almost the same as the general sibling selector. The diﬀerence is that the targeted element must be an immediate sibling, not just a general sibling. p + p { text-indent: 1.Sem; margin-bottom: 0; } <h2>Title</h2> <p>Paragraph example.</p> <p>Paragraph example.</p> <p>Paragraph example.</p> <div class=”box”> <p>Paragraph example.</p> <p>Paragraph example.</p> </div> The above example will apply the specified styles only to paragraph elements that immediately follow other paragraph elements. This means the first paragraph element on a page would not receive these styles. Also, if another element appeared between two paragraphs, the second paragraph of the two wouldn’t have the styles applied. Attribute Selector: The attribute selector targets elements based on the presence and/or value of HTML attributes, and is declared using square brackets. input [type=”text”] { background-color: #444; width: 200px; } <input type=""text"">"
"6. What is a CSS Preprocessor? What are Sass, Less, and Stylus? Why do people use them? CSS Interview Questions A CSS Preprocessor is a tool used to extend the basic functionality of default vanilla CSS through its own scripting language. It helps us to use complex logical syntax like – variables, functions, mixins, code nesting, and inheritance to name a few, supercharging your vanilla CSS. SASS: Sass is the acronym for “Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets”. SASS can be written in two diﬀerent syntaxes using SASS or SCSS SASS vs SCSS SASS is based on indentation and SCSS(Sassy CSS) is not. SASS uses .sass extension while SCSS uses .scss extension. SASS doesn’t use curly brackets or semicolons. SCSS uses it, just like the CSS. SASS Syntax $font-color: #fff $bg-color: #00f #box color: $font-color background: $bg-color SCSS Syntax $font-color: #fff; $bg-color: #00f; #box{ color: $font-color; background: $bg-color; } LESS: LESS is an acronym for “Leaner Stylesheets”. LESS is easy to add to any javascript projects by using NPM or less.js file. It uses the extension .less. LESS syntax is the same as the SCSS with some exceptions. LESS uses @ to define the variables. CSS Interview Questions @font-color: #fff; @bg-color: #00f #box{ color: @font-color; background: @bg-color; } Stylus: Stylus oﬀers a great deal of flexibility in writing syntax, supports native CSS as well as allows omission of brackets, colons, and semicolons. It doesn’t use @ or $ for defining variables. /* STYLUS SYNTAX WRITTEN LIKE NATIVE CSS */ font-color= #fff; bg-color = #00f; #box { color: font-color; background: bg-color; } /* OR */ /* STYLUS SYNTAX WITHOUT CURLY BRACES */ font-color= #fff; bg-color = #00f; #box color: font-color; background: bg-color;"
"7. What is VH/VW (viewport height/ viewport width) in CSS? It’s a CSS unit used to measure the height and width in percentage with respect to the viewport. It is used mainly in responsive design techniques. The measure VH is equal to 1/100 of the height of the viewport. If the height of the browser is 1000px, 1vh is equal to 10px. Similarly, if the width is 1000px, then 1 vw is equal to 10px."
"8. Diﬀerence between reset vs normalize CSS?. How do they diﬀer? CSS Interview Questions Reset CSS: CSS resets aim to remove all built-in browser styling. For example margins, paddings, font-sizes of all elements are reset to be the same. Normalize CSS: Normalize CSS aims to make built-in browser styling consistent across browsers. It also corrects bugs for common browser dependencies."
"9. What is the diﬀerence between inline, inline-block, and block? Block Element: The block elements always start on a new line. They will also take space for an entire row or width. List of block elements are <div>, <p>. Inline Elements: Inline elements don't start on a new line, they appear on the same line as the content and tags beside them. Some examples of inline elements are <a>, <span> , <strong>, and <img> tags. Inline Block Elements: Inline-block elements are similar to inline elements, except they can have padding and margins added on all four sides."

CSS Interview Questions /* mouse over link */ a:hover { color: #FFOOFF; } A pseudo-element however allows us to create items that do not normally exist in the document tree, for example ::a"
"12. How do you specify units in the CSS?. What are the diﬀerent ways to do it? There are diﬀerent ways to specify units in CSS like px, em, pt, percentage (%). px(Pixel) gives fine-grained control and maintains alignment because 1 px or multiple of 1 px is guaranteed to look sharp. px is not cascade. em maintains relative size. you can have responsive fonts. Em, will cascade 1em is equal to the current font-size of the element or the browser default. If u sent font-size to 16px then 1em = 16px. The common practice is to set default body font-size to 62.5% (equal to 10px). pt(point) are traditionally used in print. 1pt = 1/72 inch and it is a fixed-size unit. %(percentage) sets font-size relative to the font size of the body. Hence, you have to set the font-size of the body to a reasonable size."

"14. Explain CSS position property? Absolute To place an element exactly where you want to place it. absolute position is actually set relative to the element's parent. if no parent is available then the relative place to the page itself (it will default all the way back up to the element). Relative ""Relative to itself"". Setting position: relative; on an element and no other positioning attributes, it will no eﬀect on its positioning. It allows the use of z-index on the element and it limits the scope of absolutely positioned child elements. Any child element will be absolutely positioned within that block. Fixed The element is positioned relative to the viewport or the browser window itself. viewport doesn't change if you scroll and hence the fixed element will stay right in the same position. Static Static default for every single page element. The only reason you would ever set an element to position: static is to forcefully-remove some positioning that got applied to an element outside of your control. Sticky Sticky positioning is a hybrid of relative and fixed positioning. The element is treated as relative positioned until it crosses a specified threshold, at which point it is treated as fixed positioned. CSS Interview Questions CSS Position Property"
"15. What does DOM reflow occur? Reflow is the name of the web browser process for re-calculating the positions and geometries of elements in the document, for the purpose of re-rendering part or all of the document.

Grid layout is intended for larger-scale layouts which aren’t linear in design. Flexbox is largely a one-dimensional system (either in a column or a row). Flexbox layout is most appropriate to the components of an application."
"25. How does Calc work? The CSS3 calc() function allows us to perform mathematical operations on property values. Instead of declaring, for example, static pixel values for an element's width, we can use calc() to specify that the width is the result of the addition of two or more numeric values. .foo { Width: calc(100px + 50px) }"
"26. What do CSS Custom properties variables mean? Custom properties (sometimes referred to as CSS variables or cascading variables) are defined by users that contain specific values to be reused throughout a document.

"31. What is progressive rendering? How do you implement progressive rendering in the website?. What are the advantages of it? Progressive rendering is the name given to techniques used to improve the performance of a webpage (in particular, improve perceived load time) to render content for display as quickly as possible. We can implement the progressive rendering of the page by loading the lazy loading of the images. We can use Intersection Observer API to lazy load the image. The API makes it simple to detect when an element enters the viewport and take an action when it does. Once the image enters the viewport, we will start loading the images. A sample snippet is given below. CSS Interview Questions <img class=""lazy"" src=""placeholder-image.jpg"" data-src=""image-to-lazy-load-1x.jpg"" data-srcset=""image-to-lazy-load-2x.jpg 2x, image-to-lazy-load-1x.jpg 1x"" alt=""I'm an image!""> document.addEventListener(""DOMContentLoaded"", function() { var lazyImages = [].slice.call(document.querySelectorAll(""img.lazy"")); if (""IntersectionObserver"" in window) { let lazyImageObserver = new IntersectionObserver(function(entries, observer) { entries.forEach(function(entry) { if (entry.isIntersecting) { let lazyImage = entry.target; lazyImage.src = lazyImage.dataset.src; lazyImage.srcset = lazyImage.dataset.srcset; lazyImage.classList.remove(""lazy""); lazyImageObserver.unobserve(lazyImage); } }); }); lazyImages.forEach(function(lazyImage) { lazyImageObserver.observe(lazyImage); }); } else { // Possibly fall back to event handlers here } });"
"32. What are the advantages of using translate() instead of absolute position? Translate() does not cause the browser to trigger repaint and layout and instead only acts on the compositor. The absolute position triggers the repaint or DOM reflow. So, translate() gives the better performance."

"12. Explain web service Architecture. Web Services Interview Questions Every framework requires some type of architecture to ensure that the entire framework works perfectly as desired, the same goes for web services. Web service architecture is used to assist the developer with steps and procedures that are essential to complete the creation. Web service architecture includes three distinct roles i.e., service provider, service requester, and service registry. It also includes three diﬀerent operations that include: Publish (Publication of Service Descriptions): A service description needs to be published so that the service requestor can locate and have access to it. It can be published anywhere depending upon the requirements of the application. Find (Finding of Services Descriptions): A service description is retrieved directly by a service requestor. The requestor consults the broker to locate a web service that is already published. Bind (Invoking of Service based on Service Description): Every service needs to be invoked.

This <div> has the class=""carousel"" to indicate that it contains a carousel. When a new item is displayed, the .slide class adds a CSS transition and animation eﬀect that causes the objects to slide. If you don't want this eﬀect, leave this class out. When the page loads, the data-ride= ""carousel"" attribute tells Bootstrap to start animating the carousel right away. The section on ""Indicators"" is as follows: Each slide's indicators are the small dots at the bottom (which indicates how many slides there are in the carousel, and which slide the user is currently viewing). With the class .carousel-indications, the indicators are supplied in an ordered list. The data-target attribute refers to the carousel's id. When a user clicks on a given dot, the data-slide-to attribute defines the slide they should go to. The ""Wrapper"" section is as follows: A div with the class .carousel-inner specifies the slides. Each slide's content is defined by a div with the class .item. This can be in the form of text or visuals. One of the slides must have the .active class applied to it.

Discuss the properties of flexbox The properties of flexbox are: Enable flex behaviors: To make a flexible container and convert direct children elements into flex items, use the ""display"" utility. Additional flex characteristics can be used to further customize flex containers and items. Default flexbox container: <div class=""d-flex p-2"">flexbox container</div> You can also create an inline flexbox container. Responsive variations also exist. Direction: You can use direction utilities to change the direction of a flex item in a flex container. It is not essential to create a horizontal class because it is set to row by default. To show the flex items horizontally, use .flex-row (side by side). To right-align the horizontal direction, use .flex-row-reverse. Use .flex-column to display flex items vertically (on top of each other), or .flex- column-reverse to display them in the other direction. Justify content: To adjust the alignment of flex elements, use the.justify-content-* classes. Start (default), end, center, between, and around are all valid classes.

It also increases the storage capacity of the system and its main purpose is to achieve data redundancy to reduce data loss. Diﬀerent levels of RAID Nowadays, RAID is available in various schemes or RAID level as given below: Operating System Interview Questions RAID 0 - Non-redundant striping: This level is used to increase the performance of the server. RAID 1 - Mirroring and duplexing: This level is also known as disk mirroring and is considered the simplest way to implement fault tolerance. RAID 2 - Memory-style error-correcting codes: This level generally uses dedicated hamming code parity I.e., a liner form of error correction code. RAID 3 - Bit-interleaved Parity: This level requires a dedicated parity drive to store parity information. RAID 4 - Block-interleaved Parity: This level is similar to RAID 5 but the only diﬀerence is that this level confines all parity data to a single drive. RAID 5 - Block-interleaved distributed Parity: This level provides far better performance than disk mirroring and fault tolerance. RAID 6 - P+Q Redundancy: This level generally provides fault tolerance for two drive failures."

It is fully stored in boot blocks at a fixed location on the disk. It also locates the kernel and loads it into the main memory a"
"9. Explain demand paging? Demand paging is a method that loads pages into memory on demand. This method is mostly used in virtual memory. In this, a page is only brought into memory when a location on that particular page is referenced during execution. The following steps are generally followed: Attempt to access the page. If the page is valid (in memory) then continue processing instructions as normal. If a page is invalid then a page-fault trap occurs. Check if the memory reference is a valid reference to a location on secondary memory. If not, the process is terminated (illegal memory access). Otherwise, we have to page in the required page. Schedule disk operation to read the desired page into main memory. Restart the instruction that was interrupted by the operating system trap."

In this mechanism, diﬀerent processes can communicate with each other with the approval of the OS. Diﬀerent IPC Mechanisms: Pipes Message Queuing Semaphores Socket Shared Memory Signals"
"13. What is diﬀerent between main memory and secondary memory. Main memory: Main memory in a computer is RAM (Random Access Memory). It is also known as primary memory or read-write memory or internal memory. The programs and data that the CPU requires during the execution of a program are stored in this memory. Secondary memory: Secondary memory in a computer are storage devices that can store data and programs. It is also known as external memory or additional memory or backup memory or auxiliary memory. Such storage devices are capable of storing high-volume data. Storage devices can be hard drives, USB flash drives, CDs, etc. Operating System Interview Questions Primary Memory Secondary Memory Data can be directly accessed by the processing unit.Firstly, data is transferred to primary memory and a"
14. What do you mean by overlays in OS? Operating System Interview Questions Overlays is basically a programming method that divides processes into pieces so that instructions that are important and need can be saved in memory. It does not need any type of support from the OS. It can run programs that are bigger in size than physical memory by only keeping only important data and instructions that can be needed at any given time.
15. Write top 10 examples of OS? Some of the top OS’s that are used mostly are given below: MS-Windows Ubuntu Mac OS Fedora Solaris Free BSD Chrome OS CentOS Debian Android Intermediate OS Interview Questions
"16. What is virtual memory? It is a memory management technique feature of OS that creates the illusion to users of a very large (main) memory. It is simply space where a greater number of programs can be stored by themselves in the form of pages. It enables us to increase the use of physical memory by using a disk and also allows us to have memory protection. It can be managed in two common ways by OS i.e., paging and segmentation. It acts as temporary storage that can be used along with RAM for computer processes. Operating System Interview Questions"
"17. What is thread in OS? Thread is a path of execution that is composed of a program counter, thread id, stack, and set of registers within the process. It is a basic unit of CPU utilization that makes communication more eﬀective and eﬀicient, enables utilization of multiprocessor architectures to a greater scale and greater eﬀiciency, and reduces the time required in context switching. It simply provides a way to improve and increase the performance of applications through parallelism. Threads are sometimes called lightweight processes because they have their own stack but can access shared data. Multiple threads running in a process share: Address space, Heap, Static data, Code segments, File descriptors, Global variables, Child processes, Pending alarms, Signals, and signal handlers. Each thread has its own: Program counter, Registers, Stack, and State. Operating System Interview Questions"
"18. What is a process? What are the diﬀerent states of a process? The process is basically a program that is currently under execution. The main function of an OS is to manage and handle all of these processes. When a program is loaded into the memory and it becomes a process, it can be divided into four sections ─ stack, heap, text, and data. There are two types of processes:"
1. Operating System Processes
"2. User Processes Operating System Interview Questions States of Process: Diﬀerent states of the process through which process goes are given below: New State: In this state, a process is just created. Running: In this state, the CPU starts working on the process’s instructions. Waiting: In this state, the process cannot run because it just waits for some event to occur Ready: In this state, the process has all resources available that are required to run but it waits to get assigned to a processor because CPUs are not working currently on instructions passed by the process. Terminate: In this state, the process is completed I.e., the process has finished execution."
"19. What do you mean by FCFS? Operating System Interview Questions FCFS (First Come First Serve) is a type of OS scheduling algorithm that executes processes in the same order in which processes arrive. In simple words, the process that arrives first will be executed first. It is non-preemptive in nature. FCFS scheduling may cause the problem of starvation if the burst time of the first process is the longest among all the jobs. Burst time here means the time that is required in milliseconds by the process for its execution. It is also considered the easiest and simplest OS scheduling algorithm as compared to others. Implementation of FCFS is generally managed with help of the FIFO (First In First Out) queue."
20. What is Reentrancy? Reentrant is simply a function in which various clients can use and shares a single copy of a program during a similar period. This concept is generally associated with OS code and does not deal with concurrency. It has two major functions: Program code cannot change or modify itself. Local data for every client process needs to be stored in diﬀerent disks.
"21. What is a Scheduling Algorithm? Name diﬀerent types of scheduling algorithms. A scheduling algorithm is a process that is used to improve eﬀiciency by utilizing maximum CPU and providing minimum waiting time to tasks. It simply deals with the problem of deciding which of outstanding requests is to be allocated resources. Its main aim is to reduce resource starvation and to ensure fairness amongst parties that are utilizing the resources. In simple words, it is used to allocate resources among various competing tasks. Types of Scheduling Algorithm There are diﬀerent types of scheduling algorithms as given below: Operating System Interview Questions"
"22. What is the diﬀerence between paging and segmentation? Paging: It is generally a memory management technique that allows OS to retrieve processes from secondary storage into main memory. It is a non-contiguous allocation technique that divides each process in the form of pages. Segmentation: It is generally a memory management technique that divides processes into modules and parts of diﬀerent sizes. These parts and modules are known as segments that can be allocated to process. Operating System Interview Questions Paging Segmentation It is invisible to a programmer.It is visible to a programmer. In this, the size of pages is fixed.In this, the size of segments is not fixed. Procedures and data cannot be separated in paging.Procedures and data can be separated in segmentation. It allows a cumulative total of virtual address spaces to cross physical main memory.It allows all programs, data, and codes to break up into independent address spaces. It is mostly available on CPUs and MMU chips.It is mostly available on Windows servers that may support backward compatibility, while Linux has limited support. It is faster for memory access as compared to segmentation.It is slower as compared to paging. In this, OS needs to maintain a free frame.In this, OS needs to maintain a list of holes in the main memory. In paging, the type of fragmentation is internal.In segmentation, the type of fragmentation is external. The size of the page is determined by available memory.The size of the page is determined by the user. Operating System Interview Questions"
"23. What is thrashing in OS? It is generally a situation where the CPU performs less productive work and more swapping or paging work. It spends more time swapping or paging activities rather than its execution. By evaluating the level of CPU utilization, a system can detect thrashing. It occurs when the process does not have enough pages due to which the page-fault rate is increased. It inhibits much application-level processing that causes computer performance to degrade or collapse."
"24. What is the main objective of multiprogramming? It refers to the ability to execute or perform more than one program on a single processor machine. This technique was introduced to overcome the problem of underutilization of CPU and main memory. In simple words, it is the coordination of execution of various programs simultaneously on a single processor (CPU). The main objective of multiprogramming is to have at least some processes running at all times. It simply improves the utilization of the CPU as it organizes many jobs where the CPU always has one to execute."
25. What do you mean by asymmetric clustering? Operating System Interview Questions Asymmetric Clustering is generally a system in which one of the nodes among all nodes is in hot standby mode whereas the rest of all nodes run diﬀerent applications. It simply uses whole or entire hardware resources therefore it is considered a more reliable system as compared to others.
"26. What is the diﬀerence between multitasking and multiprocessing OS? Multitasking: It is a system that allows more eﬀicient use of computer hardware. This system works on more than one task at one time by rapidly switching between various tasks. These systems are also known as time-sharing systems. Operating System Interview Questions Multiprocessing: It is a system that allows multiple or various processors in a computer to process two or more diﬀerent portions of the same program simultaneously. It is used to complete more work in a shorter period of time. Operating System Interview Questions Multitasking Multiprocessing It performs more than one task at a time using a single processor.It performs more than one task at a time using multiple processors.

"28. Explain zombie process? Zombie process, referred to as a defunct process, is basically a process that is terminated or completed but the whole process control block is not cleaned up from the main memory because it still has an entry in the process table to report to its parent process. It does not consume any of the resources and is dead, but it still exists. It also shows that resources are held by process and are not free."
29. What do you mean by cascading termination? Cascading termination is a process termination in which if the parent process is exiting or terminating then the children process will also get terminated. It does not allow the child to continue processing as its parent process terminates. It is generally initiated by OS.
"30. What is starvation and aging in OS? Operating System Interview Questions Starvation: It is generally a problem that usually occurs when a process has not been able to get the required resources it needs for progress with its execution for a long period of time. In this condition, low priority processes get blocked and only high priority processes proceed towards completion because of which low priority processes suﬀer from lack of resources. Aging: It is a technique that is used to overcome the situation or problem of starvation. It simply increases the priority of processes that wait in the system for resources for a long period of time. It is considered the best technique to resolve the problem of starvation as it adds an aging factor to the priority of each and every request by various processes for resources. It also ensures that low-level queue jobs or processes complete their execution. Advanced OS Interview Questions"
"31. What do you mean by Semaphore in OS? Why is it used? Semaphore is a signaling mechanism. It only holds one positive integer value. It is simply used to solve the problem or issue of critical sections in the synchronization process by using two atomic operations i.e., wait() and signal(). Types of Semaphore There are usually two types of semaphores as given below: Binary Semaphore Counting Semaphore Operating System Interview Questions Binary Semaphore Mutex It allows various process threads to get the finite instance of the resource until resources are available.It allows various process threads to get single shared resource only at a time. Its functions are based upon signaling mechanisms.Its functions are based upon a locking mechanism. Binary semaphores are much faster as compared to Mutex.Mutex is slower as compared to binary semaphores. It is basically an integer. It is basically an object."
"32. What is Kernel and write its main functions? The kernel is basically a computer program usually considered as a central component or module of OS. It is responsible for handling, managing, and controlling all operations of computer systems and hardware. Whenever the system starts, the kernel is loaded first and remains in the main memory. It also acts as an interface between user applications and hardware. Operating System Interview Questions Functions of Kernel: It is responsible for managing all computer resources such as CPU, memory, files, processes, etc. It facilitates or initiates the interaction between components of hardware and so"
33. What are diﬀerent types of Kernel? There are basically five types of Kernels as given below: Operating System Interview Questions Monolithic Kernel MicroKernel Hybrid Kernel Nano Kernel Exo Kernel
"34. Write diﬀerence between micro kernel and monolithic kernel? MicroKernel: It is a minimal OS that executes only important functions of OS. It only contains a near-minimum number of features and functions that are required to implement OS. Example: QNX, Mac OS X, K42, etc. Monolithic Kernel: It is an OS architecture that supports all basic features of computer components such as resource management, memory, file, etc. Example: Solaris, DOS, OpenVMS, Linux, etc. Operating System Interview Questions MicroKernel Monolithic Kernel In this so"
35. What is SMP (Symmetric Multiprocessing)? SMP is generally referred to as computer architecture in which the processing of programs is done by multiple processors that share a common OS and memory. SMP is very much required if you want to take advantage of multiprocessor hardware. It simply enables any processor to work on any of the tasks no matter where data or resources for that particular task are located in memory. These systems are more reliable than single-processor systems. Operating System Interview Questions
"36. What is a time-sharing system? It is a system that allows more than one user to access the resources of a particular system in many locations. In simple words, it performs multiple tasks on a single processor or CPU. As the name suggests, it means to share time into multiple slots in several processes. It also allows diﬀerent users from diﬀerent locations to use a particular computer system at the same time therefore it is considered one of the important types of OS."
"37. What is Context Switching? Context switching is basically a process of saving the context of one process and loading the context of another process. It is one of the cost-eﬀective and time-saving measures executed by CPU the because it allows multiple processes to share a single CPU. Therefore, it is considered an important part of a modern OS. This technique is used by OS to switch a process from one state to another i.e., from running state to ready state. It also allows a single CPU to handle and control various diﬀerent processes or threads without even the need for additional resources."
38. What is diﬀerence between Kernel and OS? Operating System Interview Questions Kernel: Kernel is a system program that controls all programs running on the computer. The kernel is basically a bridge between the so
"39. What is diﬀerence between process and thread? Operating System Interview Questions Process: It is basically a program that is currently under execution by one or more threads. It is a very important part of the modern-day OS. Thread: It is a path of execution that is composed of the program counter, thread id, stack, and set of registers within the process. Operating System Interview Questions Process Thread It is a computer program that is under execution.It is the component or entity of the process that is the smallest execution unit.

It is more diﬀicult to create a process as compared to creating a thread.It is easier to create a thread as compared to creating a process. It requires more resources as compared to thread.It requires fewer resources as compared to processes. It takes more time to create and terminate a process as compared to a thread.It takes less time to create and terminate a thread as compared to a process. It usually run-in separate memory space.It usually run-in shared memory space. It does not share data.It shares data with each other. It can be divided into multiple threads.It can’t be further subdivided. Operating System Interview Questions"
40. What are various sections of the process? There are basically four sections in the process as given below: Stack: It is used for local variables and returns addresses. Heap: It is used for dynamic memory allocation. Data: It stores global and static variables. Code or text: It comprises compiled program code.
"41. What is a deadlock in OS? What are the necessary conditions for a deadlock? Operating System Interview Questions Deadlock is generally a situation where a set of processes are blocked as each process is holding resources and waits to acquire resources held by another process. In this situation, two or more processes simply try to execute simultaneously and wait for each to finish their execution because they are dependent on each other. We can see a hand problem in our system whenever a deadlock occurs in a program. It is one of the common problems you can see in multiprocessing. Necessary Conditions for Deadlock There are basically four necessary conditions for deadlock as given below: Mutual Exclusion Hold and Wait No Pre-emption Circular Wait or Resource Wait"
"42. What do you mean by Belady’s Anomaly? In the Operating System, process data is loaded in fixed-sized chunks and each chunk is referred to as a page. The processor loads these pages in the fixed-sized chunks of memory called frames. Belady’s Anomaly is a phenomenon in which if we increase the number of frames in memory, then the number of page faults also increases. It is generally experienced when we use FIFO (First in First out) page replacement algorithm."
"QA Interview Questions Starbucks lost millions of dollars in sales in 2015 due to a problem with their daily system refresh, which resulted in the closure of point-of-sale registers in many locations across the United States and Canada.

A Traceability Matrix is a document that connects any two baseline documents that require a many-to-many link to ensure that the relationship is complete. It's used to keep track of requirements and make sure they're being met on the present project. The following are the three major components of a traceability matrix: Forward Traceability: This matrix is used to determine whether the project is progressing in the appropriate direction and for the correct product. It ensures that each specification is applied to the product and that each specification is adequately tested. It connects test cases to requirements. Backward or reverse Traceability: It is used to verify that the present product is still on track. The goal of this form of traceability is to ensure that we are not expanding the project's scope by adding code, design features, testing, or other activities not stated in the requirements. It connects requirements to test cases. Bidirectional Traceability: This traceability matrix ensures that all criteria are covered by test cases in both directions (forward and backward). It examines the impact of a change in requirements caused by a work product defect, and vice versa."

"Angular Interview Questions For tackling the above problems, client-side frameworks like Angular came into the picture, which made life easier for the developers by handling the separation of concerns and dividing code into smaller bits of information (In the case of Angular, called Components). Client-side frameworks allow one to develop advanced web applications like Single- Page-Application. Not that we cannot develop SPAs using VanillaJS, but by doing so, the development process becomes slower."
"2. How does an Angular application work? Every Angular app consists of a file named angular.json. This file will contain all the configurations of the app. While building the app, the builder looks at this file to find the entry point of the application. Following is an image of the angular.json file: ""build"": { ""builder"": ""@angular-devkit/build-angular:browser"", ""options"": { ""outputPath"": ""dist/angular-starter"", ""index"": ""src/index.html"", ""main"": ""src/main.ts"", ""polyfills"": ""src/polyfills.ts"", ""tsConfig"": ""tsconfig.app.json"", ""aot"": false, ""assets"": [ ""src/favicon.ico"", ""src/assets"" ], ""styles"": [ ""./node_modules/@angular/material/prebuilt-themes/deeppurple-amber.css"", ""src/style.css"" ] } } Inside the build section, the main property of the options object defines the entry point of the application which in this case is main.ts. The main.ts file creates a browser environment for the application to run, and, along with this, it also calls a function called bootstrapModule, which bootstraps the application. These two steps are performed in the following order inside the main.ts file: Angular Interview Questions import { platformBrowserDynamic } from '@angular/platform-browser-dynamic'; platformBrowserDynamic().bootstrapModule(AppModule) In the above line of code, AppModule is getting bootstrapped. The AppModule is declared in the app.module.ts file. This module contains declarations of all the components. Below is an example of app.module.ts file: import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser'; import { NgModule } from '@angular/core'; import { AppComponent } from './app.component'; @NgModule({ declarations: [ AppComponent ], imports: [ BrowserModule ], providers: [], entryComponents: [], bootstrap: [AppComponent] }) export class AppModule { } As one can see in the above file, AppComponent is getting bootstrapped. This component is defined in app.component.ts file. This file interacts with the webpage and serves data to it. Below is an example of app.component.ts file: Angular Interview Questions import { Component } from '@angular/core'; @Component({ selector: 'app-root', templateUrl: './app.component.html', styleUrls: ['./app.component.css'] }) export class AppComponent { title = 'angular'; } Each component is declared with three properties: Selector - used for accessing the component Template/TemplateURL - contains HTML of the component StylesURL - contains component-specific stylesheets A"
"3. What are some of the advantages of Angular over other frameworks? Angular Interview Questions Features that are provided out of the box - Angular provides a number of built- in features like routing, state management, rxjs library and http servicesstraight out of the box. This means that one does not need to look for the above-stated features separately. They are all provided with angular. Declarative UI - Angular uses HTML to render the UI of an application. HTML is a declarative language and is much easier to use than JavaScript. Long-term Google support - Google announced Long-term support for Angular. This means that Google plans to stick with Angular and further scale up its ecosystem."
"4. What are the advantages of Angular over React? Angular vs React: Angular Interview Questions Angular React Angular supports bidirectional data binding as well as mutable data.React only supports unidirectional and immutable data binding. The biggest benefit of Angular is that it enables dependency injection.React allows us to either accomplish it ourselves or with the aid of a third-party library. Angular can be used in both mobile and web development.React can only be used in UI development only. Angular features a wide wide range of tools, libraries, frameworks, plugins, and so on that make development faster and more fun.In React we can use third-party libraries for any features. Angular uses Typescript. React uses Javascript."
"5. List out diﬀerences between AngularJS and Angular? Angular Interview Questions Architecture AngularJS uses MVC or Model-View-Controller architecture, where the Model contains the business logic, the Controller processes information and the View shows the information present in the Model. Angular replaces controllers with Components. Components are nothing but directives with a predefined template. Language AngularJS uses JavaScript language, which is a dynamically typed language. Angular uses TypeScript language, which is a statically typed language and is a superset of JavaScript. By using statically typed language, Angular provides better performance while developing larger applications. Mobile Support AngularJS does not provide mobile support. Angular is supported by all popular mobile browsers. Structure While developing larger applications, the process of maintaining code becomes tedious in the case of AngularJS. In the case of Angular, it is easier to maintain code for larger applications as it provides a better structure. Expression Syntax While developing an AngularJS application, a developer needs to remember the correct ng-directive for binding an event or a property. Whereas in Angular, property binding is done using ""[ ]"" attribute and event binding is done using ""( )"" attribute. Find out more."
"6. How are Angular expressions diﬀerent from JavaScript expressions? Angular Interview Questions The first and perhaps, the biggest diﬀerence is that Angular expressions allow us to write JavaScript in HTML which is not the case when it comes to JavaScript expressions. Next, Angular expressions are evaluated against a local scope object whereas JavaScript expressions are against a global window object. Let's understand that better with an example : Consider the following component named test: import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core'; @Component({ selector: 'app-test', template: ` <h4>{{message}}</h4> `, styleUrls: ['./test.component.css'] }) export class TestComponent implements OnInit { message:string = “Hello world”; constructor() { } ngOnInit() { } } As one can see that Angular expression is used to display the message property of a component. Since we are using Angular expressions, in the present template, we cannot access a property outside of its local scope, which in this case is TestComponent. This proves that Angular expressions are always evaluated based on the scope object rather than the global object. The next diﬀerence is how Angular expressions handle null and undefined. Consider the following JavaScript example: Angular Interview Questions <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang=""en""> <head> <meta charset=""UTF-8""> <meta name=""viewport"" content=""width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0""> <title>JavaScript Test</title> </head> <body> <div id=""foo""><div> </body> <script> 'use strict'; let bar = {}; document.getElementById('foo').innerHTML = bar.x; </script> </html> If you run the above code, you will see undefined displayed on the screen. Although it’s not ideal to leave any property undefined, the user does not need to see this. Now consider the following Angular example: import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core'; @Component({ selector: 'app-new', template: ` <h4>{{message}}</h4> `, styleUrls: ['./new.component.css'] }) export class NewComponent implements OnInit { message:object = {}; constructor() { } ngOnInit() { } } If you render the above component, you will not see undefined being displayed on the screen. Next, in Angular expressions, one cannot use loops, conditionals and exceptions. Angular Interview Questions The diﬀerence which makes Angular expressions quite beneficial is the use of pipes. Angular uses pipes(called filters in AngularJS), which can be used to format data before displaying it. Let’s see one predefined pipe in action: import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core'; @Component({ selector: 'app-new', template: ` <h4>{{message | lowercase}}</h4> `, styleUrls: ['./new.component.css'] }) export class NewComponent implements OnInit { message:string = ""HELLO WORLD""; constructor() { } ngOnInit() { } } In the above code, we have used a predefined pipe called lowercase, which transforms all the letters in lowercase. Therefore, if you render the above component, you will see “hello world” being displayed. In contrast, JavaScript does not have the concept of pipes."
"7. What are Single Page Applications (SPA)? Single page applications are web based applications that only need to be loaded once, with new functionality consisting of only minor changes to the user interface. It does not load new HTML pages to display the content of the new page, but rather generates it dynamically. This is made feasible by JavaScript's ability to alter DOM components on the current page. A Single Page Application method is speedier, resulting in a more consistent user experience."
"8. What are templates in Angular? Angular Interview Questions A template is a kind of HTML that instructs Angular about how to display a component. An Angular HTML template, like conventional HTML, produces a view, or user interface, in the browser, but with far more capabilities. Angular API evaluates an HTML template of a component, creates HTML, and renders it. There are two ways to create a template in an Angular component: Inline Template Linked Template Inline Template: The component decorator's template config is used to specify an inline HTML template for a component. The Template will be wrapped inside the single or double quotes. Example: @Component({ selector: ""app-greet"", template: `<div> <h1> Hello {{name}} how are you ? </h1> <h2> Welcome to interviewbit ! </h2> </div>` }) Linked Template: A component may include an HTML template in a separate HTML file. As illustrated below, the templateUrl option is used to indicate the path of the HTML template file. Example: @Component({ selector: ""app-greet"", templateUrl: ""./component.html"" })"
"9. What are directives in Angular? A directive is a class in Angular that is declared with a @Directive decorator. Angular Interview Questions Every directive has its own behaviour and can be imported into various components of an application. When to use a directive? Consider an application, where multiple components need to have similar functionalities. The norm thing to do is by adding this functionality individually to every component but, this task is tedious to perform. In such a situation, one can create a directive having the required functionality and then, import the directive to components which require this functionality. Types of directives:"
"1. Component directives These form the main class in directives. Instead of @Directive decorator we use @Component decorator to declare these directives. These directives have a view, a stylesheet and a selector property."
"2. Structural directives These directives are generally used to manipulate DOM elements. Every structural directive has a ‘ * ’ sign before them. We can apply these directives to any DOM element. Let’s see some built-in structural directives in action: <div *ngIf=""isReady"" class=""display_name""> {{name}} </div> <div class=""details"" *ngFor=""let x of details"" > <p>{{x.name}}</p> <p> {{x.address}}</p> <p>{{x.age}}</p> </div> In the above example, we can *ngIf and *ngFor directives being used. *ngIf is used to check a boolean value and if it’s truthy,the div element will be displayed. Angular Interview Questions *ngFor is used to iterate over a list and display each item of the list."
"3. Attribute Directives These directives are used to change the look and behaviour of a DOM element. Let’s understand attribute directives by creating one: How to create a custom directive? We’re going to create an attribute directive: In the command terminal, navigate to the directory of the angular app and type the following command to generate a directive: ng g directive blueBackground The following directive will be generated. Manipulate the directive to look like this: import { Directive, ElementRef } from '@angular/core'; @Directive({ selector: '[appBlueBackground]' }) export class BlueBackgroundDirective { constructor(el:ElementRef) { el.nativeElement.style.backgroundColor = ""blue""; } } Now we can apply the above directive to any DOM element: <p appBlueBackground>Hello World!</p>"
"10. Explain Components, Modules and Services in Angular For better understanding, I would like you to create an Angular application by running the following inside the command terminal: ng new angularApp The above command will create an angular application in the directory. Next, let's move on to understand Components, Modules, and Services. Components In Angular, components are the basic building blocks, which control a part of the UI for any application. Angular Interview Questions A component is defined using the @Component decorator. Every component consists of three parts, the template which loads the view for the component, a stylesheet which defines the look and feel for the component, and a class that contains the business logic for the component. For creating a component, inside the command terminal, navigate to the directory of the application created, and run the following command: ng generate component testOr ng g c test One can see the generated component inside src/app/test folder. The component will be defined inside test.component.ts and this is how it looks: import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core'; @Component({ selector: 'app-test', templateUrl: './test.component.html', styleUrls: ['./test.component.css'] }) export lass TestComponent implements OnInit { constructor() {} ngOnInit() { } } As we can see in the above image, our component is defined with @Component decorator. Modules A module is a place where we can group components, directives, services, and pipes. Module decides whether the components, directives, etc can be used by other modules, by exporting or hiding these elements. Every module is defined with a @NgModule decorator. By default, modules are of two types: Root Module Feature Module Every application can have only one root module whereas, it can have one or more feature modules. Angular Interview Questions A root module imports BrowserModule, whereas a feature module imports CommonModule. In the application that we created before, one can see that the root module is defined inside app.module.ts and this is how it looks: import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser'; import { NgModule } from '@angular/core'; import { AppComponent } from './app.component'; import { TestComponent } from './test/text.component'; @NgModule({ declarations: [ AppComponent, TestComponent ], imports: [ BrowserModule ], providers: [], bootstrap: [AppComponent] }) export class AppModule { } We can see in the above image that the component we created earlier is already imported in the declarations array. To create a feature module, run the following command: ng g m test-module The module is created inside the src/app/test-module/test-module.module.ts file: import { NgModule } from '@angular/core'; import { CommonModule } from '@angular/common'; @NgModule({ declarations: [], imports: [ CommonModule ] }) export class TestModuleModule { } As one can see, CommonModule is imported since this is a feature module. Angular Interview Questions Services Services are objects which get instantiated only once during the lifetime of an application. The main objective of a service is to share data, functions with diﬀerent components of an Angular application. A service is defined using a @Injectable decorator. A function defined inside a service can be invoked from any component or directive. To create a service, run the following command: ng g s test-service The service will be created inside src/app/test-service.service.ts: import { Injectable } from '@angular/core'; @Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' }) export class TestServiceService { constructor() { } } Any method/function defined inside the TestServiceService class can be directly used inside any component by just importing the service."
"11. What is the scope? In Angular, a scope is an object that refers to the application model. It is a context in which expressions can be executed. These scopes are grouped hierarchically, comparable to the DOM structure of the application. A scope aids in the propagation of various events and the monitoring of expressions."
"12. What is data binding in Angular? Data binding is one of the most significant and eﬀective elements for creating communication between the DOM and the component. It makes designing interactive apps easier by reducing the need to worry about data pushing and pulling between the component and the template. There are Four types of Data binding in Angular: Angular Interview Questions Property Binding Event Binding String Interpolation Two way data binding Property Binding: One method of data binding is called property binding. In property binding, we connect a DOM element's property to a field that is a declared property in our TypeScript component code. In reality, Angular transforms string interpolation into property binding internally. Event Binding: Using event binding, you may respond to DOM events like button clicks and mouse movements. When a DOM event (such as a click, change, or keyup) occurs, the component's designated method is called. String Interpolation: In order to export data from TypeScript code to an HTML template( view ), String Interpolation is a one way data binding approach. The data from the component is shown to the view using the template expression enclosed in double curly braces. The value of a component property is added by using string interpolation."
"13. What is two way data binding in Angular? Data sharing between a component class and its template is referred to as two-way data binding. If you alter data in one area, it will immediately reflate at the other end. This happens instantly and automatically, ensuring that the HTML template and TypeScript code are always up to date. Property binding and event binding are coupled in two-way data binding. Angular Interview Questions Example: app.component.ts import { Component } from ""@angular/core""; @Component({ selector: ""app"", templateUrl: ""./app.component.html"", }) export class AppComponent { data = ""This is an example component of two way data binding.""; } app.component.html <input [(ngModel)]=""data"" type=""text""> <br> <br> <h2> You entered the data: {{data}}</h2> app.module.ts import { NgModule } from ""@angular/core""; import { BrowserModule } from ""@angular/platform-browser""; import { FormsModule } from ""@angular/forms""; import { AppComponent } from ""./app.component""; @NgModule({ imports: [BrowserModule, FormsModule], declarations: [AppComponent], bootstrap: [AppComponent], }) export class AppModule {}"
"14. What are Decorators and their types in Angular? Decorators are a fundamental concept in TypeScript, and because Angular heavily relies on TypeScript, decorators have become an important element of Angular as well. Angular Interview Questions Decorators are methods or design patterns that are labeled with a prefixed @ symbol and preceded by a class, method, or property. They enable the modification of a service, directive, or filter before it is utilized. A decorator, in essence, provides configuration metadata that specifies how a component, class, or method should be processed, constructed, and used at runtime. Angular includes a number of decorators which attach various types of metadata to classes, allowing the system to understand what all these classes signify and how they should function. Types of decorators: Method Decorator: Method decorators, as the name implies, are used to add functionality to the methods defined within our class. Class Decorator: Class Decorators are the highest-level decorators that determine the purpose of the classes. They indicate to Angular that a specific class is a component or module. And the decorator enables us to declare this eﬀect without having to write any code within the class. Parameter Decorator: The arguments of your class constructors are decorated using parameter decorators. Property Decorator: These are the second most popular types of decorators. They enable us to enhance some of the properties in our classes."
"15. What are annotations in Angular ? These are language features that are hard-coded. Annotations are merely metadata that is set on a class to reflect the metadata library. When a user annotates a class, the compiler adds an annotations property to the class, saves an annotation array in it, and then attempts to instantiate an object with the same name as the annotation, providing the metadata into the constructor. Annotations in AngularJs are not predefined, therefore we can name them ourselves."
"16. What are pure Pipes? Angular Interview Questions These are pipelines that only employ pure functions. As a result, a pure pipe does not employ any internal state, and the output remains constant as long as the parameters provided remain constant. Angular calls the pipe only when the parameters being provided change. A single instance of the pure pipe is utilized in all components."
"17. What are impure pipes? Angular calls an impure pipe for each change detection cycle, independent of the change in the input fields. For each of these pipes, several pipe instances are produced. These pipes' inputs can be altered. By default, all pipelines are pure. However, as demonstrated below, you can specify impure pipes using the pure property. Example: @Pipe({ name: 'impurePipe', pure: false/true }) export class ImpurePipe {}"
"18. What is Pipe transform Interface in Angular? An interface used by pipes to accomplish a transformation. Angular calls the transform function with the value of a binding as the first argument and any arguments as the second parameter in list form. This interface is used to implement custom pipes. Example: Angular Interview Questions import { Pipe, PipeTransform } from '@angular/core'; @Pipe({ name: 'tranformpipe' }) export class TranformpipePipe implements PipeTransform { transform(value: unknown, ...args: unknown[]): unknown { return null; } }"
"19. Write a code where you have to share data from the Parent to Child Component? You have to share the data amongst the components in numerous situations. It may consist of unrelated, parent-child, or child-parent components. The @Input decorator allows any data to be sent from parent to child. // parent component import { Component } from '@angular/core'; @Component({ selector: 'app-parent', template: ` <app-child [childMessage]=""parentMessage""></app-child> `, styleUrls: ['./parent.component.css'] }) export class ParentComponent{ parentMessage = ""message from parent"" constructor() { } } // child component import { Component, Input } from '@angular/core'; @Component({ selector: 'app-child', template: `Say {{ childMessage }}`, styleUrls: ['./child.component.css'] }) export class ChildComponent { @Input() childMessage: string; constructor() { } }"
"20. Create a TypeScript class with a constructor and a function. Angular Interview Questions class IB { name: string; constructor(message: string) { this.name = message; } greet() { return ""Hello, "" + this.name + ""How are you""; } } let msg = new IB(""IB""); Angular Interview Questions for Experienced"
"21. Angular by default, uses client-side rendering for its applications. Can one make an angular application to render on the server-side? Yes, angular provides a technology called Angular Universal, which can be used to render applications on the server-side. The advantages of using Angular Universal are: First time users can instantly see a view of the application. This benefits in providing better user experience. Many search engines expect pages in plain HTML, thus, Universal can make sure that your content is available on every search engine, which leads to better SEO. Any server-side rendered application loads faster since rendered pages are available to the browser sooner."
22. What is Eager and Lazy loading? Loading: The eager loading technique is the default module-loading strategy. Eager loading feature modules are loaded before the program begins. This is primarily utilized for small-scale applications. Lazy Loading: Lazy loading loads the feature modules dynamically as needed. This speeds up the application. It is utilized for larger projects where all of the modules are not required at the start.
23. What is view encapsulation in Angular? Angular Interview Questions View encapsulation specifies if the component's template and styles can impact the entire program or vice versa. Angular oﬀers three encapsulation methods: Native: The component does not inherit styles from the main HTML. Styles defined in this component's @Component decorator are only applicable to this component. Emulated (Default): The component inherits styles from the main HTML. Styles set in the @Component decorator are only applicable to this component. None: The component's styles are propagated back to the main HTML and therefore accessible to all components on the page. Be wary of programs that have None and Native components. Styles will be repeated in all components with Native encapsulation if they have No encapsulation.
"24. What are RxJs in Angular ? RxJS is an acronym that stands for Reactive Extensions for JavaScript. It is used to enable the use of observables in our JavaScript project, allowing us to do reactive programming. RxJS is utilized in many popular frameworks, including Angular since it allows us to compose our asynchronous or callback-based code into a sequence of operations executed on a data stream that releases values from a publisher to a subscriber. Other programming languages, such as Java and Python, oﬀer packages that allow them to develop reactive programs utilizing observables. Most of the time, rxJs is used in HTTP calls with angular. Because http streams are asynchronous data, we can subscribe to them and apply filters to them. Example: The following is a simple example of how RxJs can be utilized with HTTP calls. let stream1 = httpc.get(""https://www.example.com/somedata""); let stream2 = stream1.pipe(filter(x=>x>3)); stream2.subscribe(res=>this.Success(res),res=>this.Error(res));"
"25. Explain string interpolation and property binding in Angular. Angular Interview Questions String interpolation and property binding are parts of data-binding in Angular. Data-binding is a feature in angular, which provides a way to communicate between the component(Model) and its view(HTML template). Data-binding can be done in two ways, one-way binding and two-way binding. In Angular, data from the component can be inserted inside the HTML template. In one-way binding, any changes in the component will directly reflect inside the HTML template but, vice-versa is not possible. Whereas, it is possible in two-way binding. String interpolation and property binding allow only one-way data binding. String interpolation uses the double curly braces {{ }} to display data from the component. Angular automatically runs the expression written inside the curly braces, for example, {{ 2 + 2 }} will be evaluated by Angular and the output 4, will be displayed inside the HTML template. Using property binding, we can bind the DOM properties of an HTML element to a component's property. Property binding uses the square brackets [ ] syntax."
"26. How are observables diﬀerent from promises? The first diﬀerence is that an Observable is lazy whereas a Promise is eager. Angular Interview Questions Promise Observable Emits a single valueEmits multiple values over a period of time Not LazyLazy. An observable is not called until we subscribe to the observable Cannot be cancelledCan be cancelled by using the unsubscribe() method Observable provides operators like map, forEach, filter, reduce, retry, retryWhen etc. Consider the following Observable: const observable = rxjs.Observable.create(observer => { console.log('Text inside an observable'); observer.next('Hello world!'); observer.complete(); }); console.log('Before subscribing an Observable'); observable.subscribe((message)=> console.log(message)); When you run the above Observable, you can see messages being displayed in the following order: Before subscribing an Observable Text inside an observable Hello world! Angular Interview Questions As you can see, observables are lazy. Observable runs only when someone subscribes to them hence, the message “Before subscribing…” is displayed ahead of the message inside the observable. Now let’s consider a Promise: const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => { console.log('Text inside promise'); resolve('Hello world!'); }); console.log('Before calling then method on Promise'); greetingPoster.then(message => console.log(message)); Running the above promise, the messages will be displayed in the following order: Text inside promise Before calling then method on Promise Hello world! As you can see the message inside Promise is displayed first. This means that a promise runs before the then method is called. Therefore, promises are eager. The next diﬀerence is that Promises are always asynchronous. Even when the promise is immediately resolved. Whereas an Observable, can be both synchronous and asynchronous. The above example of an observable is the case to show that an observable is synchronous. Let’s see the case where an observable can be asynchronous: const observable = rxjs.Observable.create(observer => { setTimeout(()=>{ observer.next('Hello world'); observer.complete(); },3000) }); console.log('Before calling subscribe on an Observable'); observable.subscribe((data)=> console.log(data)); console.log('After calling subscribe on an Observable'); Angular Interview Questions The messages will be displayed in the following order: Before calling subscribe on an Observable After calling subscribe on an Observable Hello world! You can see in this case, observable runs asynchronously. The next diﬀerence is that Observables can emit multiple values whereas Promises can emit only one value. The biggest feature of using observables is the use of operators. We can use multiple operators on an observable whereas, there is no such feature in a promise."
"27. Explain the concept of Dependency Injection? Dependency injection is an application design pattern which is implemented by Angular. It also forms one of the core concepts of Angular. So what is dependency injection in simple terms? Let’s break it down, dependencies in angular are nothing but services which have functionality. The functionality of a service, can be needed by various components and directives in an application. Angular provides a smooth mechanism by which we can inject these dependencies into our components and directives. So basically, we are just making dependencies which are injectable across all components of an application. Angular Interview Questions Let’s understand how DI (Dependency Injection) works: Consider the following service, which can be generated using: ng g service test import { Injectable } from '@angular/core'; @Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' }) export class TestService { importantValue:number = 42; constructor() { } returnImportantValue(){ return this.importantValue; } } As one can notice, we can create injectable dependencies by adding the @Injectable decorator to a class. We inject the above dependency inside the following component: Angular Interview Questions import { TestService } from './../test.service'; import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core'; @Component({ selector: 'app-test', templateUrl: './test.component.html', styleUrls: ['./test.component.css'] }) export class TestComponent implements OnInit { value:number; constructor(private testService:TestService) { } ngOnInit() { this.value = this.testService.returnImportantValue(); } } One can see we have imported our TestService at the top of the page. Then, we created an instance inside the constructor of the component and implemented the returnImportantValue function of the service. From the above example, we can observe how angular provides a smooth way to inject dependencies in any component."
"28. What are pipes in Angular explain with an example? Pipes are functions that simplify the process of wiring up your JavaScript expressions and transforming them into their desired output. They can be compared to, say, string functions in other programming languages. Pipes also allow you to combine multiple expressions together, whether they're all values or some values and some declarations. For example: var css = myTheme.color | ""red"" ; This line would assign a value to css , and it's equivalent to writing out the following code: Pipes have several built-in functions that allow you to transform data, such as value and extract. We can also create our own custom pipes. Angular Interview Questions Pipes are data transformers that execute on an Angular Component's output. They take in data and return transformed data. For example, if you have an expression such as number | 1000, the number pipe will take data from the output and transform it into 1000. In Angular, there are many built-in pipes that you can use. You can also create your own custom pipes by implementing the PipeTransform interface in a class. Pipes receive an input which can be a value expression, a function returning an expression, or even a component property., that outputs a number with a value of 1,000. With a pipe, you can transform this output into a formatted string of ""1,000"" or ""1.000"". Example: import { Component } from '@angular/core'; @Component({ selector: 'app-root', template: `{{ title | uppercase}}`, styleUrls: ['./app.component.css'] }) export class AppComponent { title = 'this is an example of custom pies in angular'; } Angular Interview Questions Output: THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF CUSTOM PIPES IN ANGULAR"
"29. What exactly is a parameterized pipe? To fine-tune its output, a pipe can receive any number of optional parameters. The parameterized pipe is constructed by first stating the pipe name followed by a colon (:) and then the parameter value. If the pipe supports several arguments, use colons to separate the values. Example: Let's look at a birthday with a certain format (dd/MM/yyyy): import { Component } from '@angular/core'; @Component({ selector: 'app-example', template: `<p>Birthday is {{ birthday | date:'dd/MM/yyyy'}}</p>` }) export class ExampleComponent { birthday = new Date(2000, 7, 15); }"
"30. What are class decorators? Class Decorators are the highest-level decorators that determine the purpose of the classes. They indicate to Angular that a specific class is a component or module. And the decorator enables us to declare this eﬀect without having to write any code within the class. Example: Angular Interview Questions import { NgModule, Component } from '@angular/core'; @Component({ selector: 'class-component', template: '<div> This is a class component ! </div>', }) export class ClassComponent { constructor() { console.log('This is a class component!'); } } @NgModule({ imports: [], declarations: [], }) export class ClassModule { constructor() { console.log('This is a class module!'); } } It is a component or module in which no code in the class is required to tell Angular. We only need to design it, and Angular will take care of the rest."
"31. What are Method decorators? Method decorators, as the name implies, are used to add functionality to the methods defined within our class. Example: @HostListener, is a good example of method decorators. import { Component, HostListener } from '@angular/core'; @Component({ selector: 'method-component', template: '<div> This is a test method component ! </div>', }) export class MethodComponent { @HostListener('click', ['$event']) onHostClick(event: Event) { console.log('clicked now this event is available !'); } } The @HostListener decorator is used before the onHostClick () method in the above example code. Angular Interview Questions"
"32. What are property decorators? These are the second most popular types of decorators. They enable us to enhance some of the properties in our classes. We can certainly understand why we utilize any certain class property by using a property decorator. There are many property decorators available for example @Input(), @Output, @ReadOnly(), @Override() Example: import { Component, Input } from '@angular/core'; @Component({ selector: 'prop-component', template: '<div> This is a test component ! </div>' }) export class PropComponent { @Input() exampleProperty: string; } The input binding would be sent via a component property binding: <prop-component [propProperty]=""propData""> </prop-component>"
"33. What is the Component Decorator in Angular? TypeScript classes are used to create components. This class genre is then decorated with the ""@Component"" decorator. The decorator's function is to take a metadata object holding component information and decorate it. A Decorator is always preceded by @. The Decorator must come before the class definition. We can also make our own decorators. Example: The example below shows us a Class decorated with the @Component decorator. Angular Interview Questions import {Component} from '@angular/core'; @Component({ selector: 'app-root', templateUrl: './app.component.html', styleUrls: ['./app.component.css'] }) export class AppComponent { title = 'Example component'; } The metadata object received by the decorator has values such as templateUrl, selector, and others, with the templateUrL property pointing to an HTML file that defines what you see on the application."
"34. What are lifecycle hooks in Angular? Explain a few lifecycle hooks. Every component in Angular has a lifecycle, and diﬀerent phases it goes through from the time of creation to the time it's destroyed. Angular provides hooks to tap into these phases and trigger changes at specific phases in a lifecycle. Angular Interview Questions ngOnChanges( ) This hook/method is called before ngOnInit and whenever one or more input properties of the component change. This method/hook receives a SimpleChanges object which contains the previous and current values of the property. ngOnInit( ) This hook gets called once, a"
"35. What are router links? RouterLink is an anchor tag directive that gives the router authority over those elements. Because the navigation routes are set. Example: As seen below, you may pass string values to the router-link directive. <h1>Example of an Angular Router</h1> <nav> <a routerLink=""/home"" >Home Page of our website</a> <a routerLink=""/about-us"" >About us</a> </nav> <router-outlet></router-outlet>"
"36. What exactly is the router state? RouterState is a route tree. This tree's nodes are aware of the ""consumed"" URL segments, retrieved arguments, and processed data. You may use the Router service and the routerState property to get the current RouterState from anywhere in the application. Angular Interview Questions Example: @Component({templateUrl:'example.html'}) class MyComponent { constructor(router: Router) { const state: RouterState = router.routerState; const root: ActivatedRoute = state.root; const child = root.firstChild; const id: Observable<string> = child.params.map(p => p.id); //... } }"
"37. What does Angular Material means? Angular Material is a user interface component package that enables professionals to create a uniform, appealing, and fully functioning websites, web pages, and web apps. It does this by adhering to contemporary web design concepts such as gentle degradation and browser probability."
38. What is ngOnInit? ngOnInit is a lifecycle hook and callback function used by Angular to mark the creation of a component. It accepts no arguments and returns a void type. Example: export class MyComponent implements OnInit { constructor() { } ngOnInit(): void { //.... } }
"39. What is transpiling in Angular ? Transpiling is the process of transforming the source code of one programming language into the source code of another. Typically, in Angular, this implies translating TypeScript to JavaScript. TypeScript (or another language like as Dart) can be used to develop code for your Angular application, which is subsequently transpiled to JavaScript. This occurs naturally and internally. Angular Interview Questions"
"40. What are HTTP interceptors ? Using the HttpClient, interceptors allow us to intercept incoming and outgoing HTTP requests. They are capable of handling both HttpRequest and HttpResponse. We can edit or update the value of the request by intercepting the HTTP request, and we can perform some specified actions on a specific status code or message by intercepting the answer. Example: In the following example we will set the Authorization header Bearer for all the requests: We have to register the interceptor as singleton in the module providers token.interceptor.ts import { Injectable } from '@angular/core'; import { HttpInterceptor, HttpRequest, HttpHandler, HttpEvent } from '@angular/common/h import { Observable } from 'rxjs/Observable'; @Injectable() export class TokenInterceptor implements HttpInterceptor { public intercept(req: HttpRequest<any>, next: HttpHandler): Observable<HttpEvent<an const token = localStorage.getItem('token') as string; if (token) { req = req.clone({ setHeaders: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}` } }); } return next.handle(req); } } Angular Interview Questions app.module.ts import { NgModule } from '@angular/core'; import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser'; import { HTTP_INTERCEPTORS } from '@angular/common/http'; import { AppComponent } from './app.component'; import { TokenInterceptor } from './token.interceptor'; @NgModule({ imports: [ BrowserModule ], declarations: [ AppComponent ], bootstrap: [AppComponent], providers: [{ provide: HTTP_INTERCEPTORS, useClass: TokenInterceptor, multi: true }] }) export class AppModule {}"
"41. What is AOT compilation? What are the advantages of AOT? Every Angular application consists of components and templates that the browser cannot understand. Therefore, all the Angular applications need to be compiled first before running inside the browser. Angular provides two types of compilation: JIT(Just-in-Time) compilation AOT(Ahead-of-Time) compilation Angular Interview Questions In JIT compilation, the application compiles inside the browser during runtime. Whereas in the AOT compilation, the application compiles during the build time. The advantages of using AOT compilation are: Since the application compiles before running inside the browser, the browser loads the executable code and renders the application immediately, which leads to faster rendering. In AOT compilation, the compiler sends the external HTML and CSS files along with the application, eliminating separate AJAX requests for those source files, which leads to fewer ajax requests. Developers can detect and handle errors during the building phase, which helps in minimizing errors. The AOT compiler adds HTML and templates into the JS files before they run inside the browser. Due to this, there are no extra HTML files to be read, which provide better security to the application. By default, angular builds and serves the application using JIT compiler: Angular Interview Questions ng build ng serve For using AOT compiler following changes should be made: ng build --aot ng serve --aot"
"42. What is Change Detection, and how does the Change Detection Mechanism work? The process of synchronizing a model with a view is known as Change Detection. Even when utilizing the ng Model to implement two-way binding, which is syntactic sugar on top of a unidirectional flow. Change detection is incredibly fast, but as an app's complexity and the number of components increase, change detection will have to do more and more work. Change Detection Mechanism-moves only ahead and never backward, beginning with the root component and ending with the last component. This is what one-way data flow entails. The tree of components is the architecture of an Angular application. Each component is a child, but the child is not a parent. A $digest loop is no longer required with the one-way flow."
"43. What is a bootstrapping module? Every application contains at least one Angular module, which is referred to as the bootstrapping module. AppModule is the most popular name for it. Example: The following is the default structure of an AngularCLI-generated AppModule: Angular Interview Questions import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser'; import { NgModule } from '@angular/core'; import { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms'; import { HttpClientModule } from '@angular/common/http'; import { AppComponent } from './app.component'; @NgModule({ declarations: [ AppComponent ], imports: [ BrowserModule, FormsModule, HttpClientModule ], providers: [], bootstrap: [AppComponent] }) export class AppModule { }"
44. Explain MVVM architecture MVVM architecture consists of three parts:
1. Model
2. View
"3. ViewModel Angular Interview Questions Model contains the structure of an entity. In simple terms it contains data of an object. View is the visual layer of the application. It displays the data contained inside the Model. In angular terms, this will be the HTML template of a component. ViewModel is an abstract layer of the application. A viewmodel handles the logic of the application. It manages the data of a model and displays it in the view. View and ViewModel are connected with data-binding (two-way data-binding in this case). Any change in the view, the viewmodel takes a note and changes the appropriate data inside the model. Angular Scenario Based Interview Questions"
"45. How do you choose an element from a component template? To directly access items in the view, use the @ViewChild directive. Consider an input item with a reference. <input #example> and construct a view child directive that is accessed in the ngA"
"46. How does one share data between components in Angular? Following are the commonly used methods by which one can pass data between components in angular: Angular Interview Questions Parent to child using @Input decorator Consider the following parent component: @Component({ selector: 'app-parent', template: ` <app-child [data]=data></app-child> ` , styleUrls: ['./parent.component.css'] }) export class ParentComponent{ data:string = ""Message from parent""; constructor() { } } In the above parent component, we are passing “data” property to the following child component: Angular Interview Questions import { Component, Input} from '@angular/core'; @Component({ selector: 'app-child', template:` <p>{{data}}</p> `, styleUrls: ['./child.component.css'] }) export class ChildComponent { @Input() data:string constructor() { } } In the child component, we are using @Input decorator to capture data coming from a parent component and using it inside the child component’s template. Child to parent using @ViewChild decorator Child component: Angular Interview Questions import {Component} from '@angular/core'; @Component({ selector: 'app-child', template:` <p>{{data}}</p> `, styleUrls: ['./child.component.css'] }) export class ChildComponent { data:string = ""Message from child to parent""; constructor() { } } Parent Component import { Component,ViewChild, AfterViewInit} from '@angular/core'; import { ChildComponent } from './../child/child.component'; @Component({ selector: 'app-parent', template: ` <p>{{dataFromChild}}</p> ` , styleUrls: ['./parent.component.css'] }) export class ParentComponent implements AfterViewInit { dataFromChild: string; @ViewChild(ChildComponent,{static:false}) child; ngAfterViewInit(){ this.dataFromChild = this.child.data; } constructor() { } } In the above example, a property named “data” is passed from the child component to the parent component. @ViewChild decorator is used to reference the child component as “child” property. Using the ngA"
"47. How do you deal with errors in observables? Instead of depending on try/catch, which is useless in an asynchronous context, you may manage problems by setting an error callback on the observer. Angular Interview Questions Example: You may create an error callback as shown below. myObservable.subscribe({ next(number) { console.log('Next number: ' + number)}, error(err) { console.log('An error received ' + err)} });"
"48. How can I include SASS into an Angular project? You may use the ng new command while building your project using angular CLI. All of your components are generated using preset sass files. ng new <Your_Project_Name> --style = sass If you want to change the style of your project, use the ng set command. ng set defaults.styleExt scss"
JavaScript Interview Questions The InterviewBit team has compiled a thorough collection of top Javascript Interview Questions and Answers to assist you in acing your interview and landing your desired job as a Javascript Developer. JavaScript Interview Questions for Freshers
"1. What are the diﬀerent data types present in javascript? To know the type of a JavaScript variable, we can use the typeof operator."
"1. Primitive types String - It represents a series of characters and is written with quotes. A string can be represented using a single or a double quote. Example : var str = ""Vivek Singh Bisht""; //using double quotes var str2 = 'John Doe'; //using single quotes Number - It represents a number and can be written with or without decimals. Example : JavaScript Interview Questions var x = 3; //without decimal var y = 3.6; //with decimal BigInt - This data type is used to store numbers which are above the limitation of the Number data type. It can store large integers and is represented by adding “n” to an integer literal. Example : var bigInteger = 234567890123456789012345678901234567890; Boolean - It represents a logical entity and can have only two values : true or false. Booleans are generally used for conditional testing. Example : var a = 2; var b = 3; var c = 2; (a == b) // returns false (a == c) //returns true Undefined - When a variable is declared but not assigned, it has the value of undefined and it’s type is also undefined. Example : var x; // value of x is undefined var y = undefined; // we can also set the value of a variable as undefined Null - It represents a non-existent or a invalid value. Example : var z = null; JavaScript Interview Questions Symbol - It is a new data type introduced in the ES6 version of javascript. It is used to store an anonymous and unique value. Example : var symbol1 = Symbol('symbol'); typeof of primitive types : typeof ""John Doe"" // Returns ""string"" typeof 3.14 // Returns ""number"" typeof true // Returns ""boolean"" typeof 234567890123456789012345678901234567890n // Returns bigint typeof undefined // Returns ""undefined"" typeof null // Returns ""object"" (kind of a bug in JavaScript) typeof Symbol('symbol') // Returns Symbol"
"2. Non-primitive types Primitive data types can store only a single value. To store multiple and complex values, non-primitive data types are used. Object - Used to store collection of data. Example: // Collection of data in key-value pairs var obj1 = { x: 43, y: ""Hello world!"", z: function(){ return this.x; } } // Collection of data as an ordered list var array1 = [5, ""Hello"", true, 4.1]; JavaScript Interview Questions Note- It is important to remember that any data type that is not a primitive data type, is of Object type in javascript."
"2. Explain Hoisting in javascript. Hoisting is the default behaviour of javascript where all the variable and function declarations are moved on top. This means that irrespective of where the variables and functions are declared, they are moved on top of the scope. The scope can be both local and global. Example 1: Example 2: hoistedVariable = 3; console.log(hoistedVariable); // outputs 3 even when the variable is declared after it var hoistedVariable; JavaScript Interview Questions Example 3: // Hoisting takes place in the local scope as well function doSomething(){ x = 33; console.log(x); var x; } doSomething(); // O utputs 33 since the local variable “x” is hoisted inside the local scope Note - Variable initializations are not hoisted, only variable declarations are hoisted: Note - To avoid hoisting, you can run javascript in strict mode by using “use strict” on top of the code: ""use strict""; x = 23; // Gives an error since 'x' is not declared var x;"
"3. Why do we use the word “debugger” in javascript? hoistedFunction(); // Outputs "" Hello world! "" even when the function is declared afte function hoistedFunction(){ console.log("" Hello world! ""); } var x; console.log(x); // Outputs ""undefined"" since the initialization of ""x"" is not hoisted x = 23; JavaScript Interview Questions The debugger for the browser must be activated in order to debug the code. Built-in debuggers may be switched on and oﬀ, requiring the user to report faults. The remaining section of the code should stop execution before moving on to the next line while debugging."
"4. Diﬀerence between “ == “ and “ === “ operators. Both are comparison operators. The diﬀerence between both the operators is that “==” is used to compare values whereas, “ === “ is used to compare both values and types. Example: var x = 2; var y = ""2""; (x == y) // Returns true since the value of both x and y is the same (x === y) // Returns false since the typeof x is ""number"" and typeof y is ""string"""
5. Diﬀerence between var and let keyword in javascript. Some diﬀerences are
"1. From the very beginning, the 'var' keyword was used in JavaScript programming whereas the keyword 'let' was just added in 2015."
"2. The keyword 'Var' has function scope. Anywhere in the function, the variable specified using var is accessible but in ‘let’ the scope of a variable declared with the 'let' keyword is limited to the block in which it is declared. Let's start with a Block Scope."
3. 'var' declares a variable that will be hoisted but 'let' declares a variable that will be hoisted.
"6. Explain Implicit Type Coercion in javascript. Implicit type coercion in javascript is the automatic conversion of value from one data type to another. It takes place when the operands of an expression are of diﬀerent data types. String coercion JavaScript Interview Questions String coercion takes place while using the ‘ + ‘ operator. When a number is added to a string, the number type is always converted to the string type. Example 1: var x = 3; var y = ""3""; x + y // Returns ""33"" Example 2: var x = 24; var y = ""Hello""; x + y // Returns ""24Hello""; Note - ‘ + ‘ operator when used to add two numbers, outputs a number. The same ‘ + ‘ operator when used to add two strings, outputs the concatenated string: var name = ""Vivek""; var surname = "" Bisht""; name + surname // Returns ""Vivek Bisht"" Let’s understand both the examples where we have added a number to a string, When JavaScript sees that the operands of the expression x + y are of diﬀerent types ( one being a number type and the other being a string type ), it converts the number type to the string type and then performs the operation. Since a"
"7. Is javascript a statically typed or a dynamically typed language? JavaScript is a dynamically typed language. In a dynamically typed language, the type of a variable is checked during run-time in contrast to a statically typed language, where the type of a variable is checked during compile-time. var a = 12; var b = ""12""; a == b // Returns true because both 'a' and 'b' are converted to the same type and then var a = 226; var b = ""226""; a === b // Returns false because coercion does not take place and the operands are of JavaScript Interview Questions Since javascript is a loosely(dynamically) typed language, variables in JS are not associated with any type. A variable can hold the value of any data type. For example, a variable that is assigned a number type can be converted to a string type: var a = 23; var a = ""Hello World!"";"
"8. What is NaN property in JavaScript? NaN property represents the “Not-a-Number” value. It indicates a value that is not a legal number. typeof of NaN will return a Number. To check if a value is NaN, we use the isNaN() function, Note- isNaN() function converts the given value to a Number type, and then equates to NaN. JavaScript Interview Questions"
"9. Explain passed by value and passed by reference. In JavaScript, primitive data types are passed by value and non-primitive data types are passed by reference. For understanding passed by value and passed by reference, we need to understand what happens when we create a variable and assign a value to it, var x = 2; In the above example, we created a variable x and assigned it a value of “2”. In the background, the “=” (assign operator) allocates some space in the memory, stores the value “2” and returns the location of the allocated memory space. Therefore, the variable x in the above code points to the location of the memory space instead of pointing to the value 2 directly. Assign operator behaves diﬀerently when dealing with primitive and non-primitive data types, Assign operator dealing with primitive types: isNaN(""Hello"") // Returns true isNaN(345) // Returns false isNaN('1') // Returns false, since '1' is converted to Number type which results in 0 isNaN(true) // Returns false, since true converted to Number type results in 1 ( a numb isNaN(false) // Returns false isNaN(undefined) // Returns true JavaScript Interview Questions var y = 234; var z = y; In the above example, the assign operator knows that the value assigned to y is a primitive type (number type in this case), so when the second line code executes, where the value of y is assigned to z, the assign operator takes the value of y (234) and allocates a new space in the memory and returns the address. Therefore, variable z is not pointing to the location of variable y, instead, it is pointing to a new location in the memory. var y = #8454; // y pointing to address of the value 234 var z = y; var z = #5411; // z pointing to a completely new address of the value 234 // Changing the value of y y = 23; console.log(z); // Returns 234, since z points to a new address in the memory so chang JavaScript Interview Questions From the above example, we can see that primitive data types when passed to another variable, are passed by value. Instead of just assigning the same address to another variable, the value is passed and new space of memory is created. Assign operator dealing with non-primitive types: var obj = { name: ""Vivek"", surname: ""Bisht"" }; var obj2 = obj; In the above example, the assign operator directly passes the location of the variable obj to the variable obj2. In other words, the reference of the variable obj is passed to the variable obj2. JavaScript Interview Questions From the above example, we can see that while passing non-primitive data types, the assign operator directly passes the address (reference). Therefore, non-primitive data types are always passed by reference."
"10. What is an Immediately Invoked Function in JavaScript? An Immediately Invoked Function ( known as IIFE and pronounced as IIFY) is a function that runs as soon as it is defined. Syntax of IIFE : (function(){ // Do something; })(); To understand IIFE, we need to understand the two sets of parentheses that are added while creating an IIFE : The first set of parenthesis: (function (){ //Do something; }) var obj = #8711; // obj pointing to address of { name: ""Vivek"", surname: ""Bisht"" } var obj2 = obj; var obj2 = #8711; // obj2 pointing to the same address // changing the value of obj1 obj1.name = ""Akki""; console.log(obj2); // Returns {name:""Akki"", surname:""Bisht""} since both the variables are pointing to the JavaScript Interview Questions While executing javascript code, whenever the compiler sees the word “function”, it assumes that we are declaring a function in the code. Therefore, if we do not use the first set of parentheses, the compiler throws an error because it thinks we are declaring a function, and by the syntax of declaring a function, a function should always have a name. To remove this error, we add the first set of parenthesis that tells the compiler that the function is not a function declaration, instead, it’s a function expression. The second set of parenthesis: (function (){ //Do something; })(); From the definition of an IIFE, we know that our code should run as soon as it is defined. A function runs only when it is invoked. If we do not invoke the function, the function declaration is returned: (function (){ // Do something; }) // Returns the function declaration Therefore to invoke the function, we use the second set of parenthesis."
"11. What do you mean by strict mode in javascript and characteristics of javascript strict-mode? function() { //Do something; } // Compiler gives an error since the syntax of declaring a function is wrong in the cod JavaScript Interview Questions In ECMAScript 5, a new feature called JavaScript Strict Mode allows you to write a code or a function in a ""strict"" operational environment. In most cases, this language is 'not particularly severe' when it comes to throwing errors. In 'Strict mode,' however, all forms of errors, including silent errors, will be thrown. As a result, debugging becomes a lot simpler. Thus programmer's chances of making an error are lowered. Characteristics of strict mode in javascript"
1. Duplicate arguments are not allowed by developers.
"2. In strict mode, you won't be able to use the JavaScript keyword as a parameter or function name."
3. The 'use strict' keyword is used to define strict mode at the start of the script. Strict mode is supported by all browsers.
4. Engineers will not be allowed to create global variables in 'Strict Mode.
"12. Explain Higher Order Functions in javascript. Functions that operate on other functions, either by taking them as arguments or by returning them, are called higher-order functions. Higher-order functions are a result of functions being first-class citizens in javascript. Examples of higher-order functions: function higherOrder(fn) { fn(); } higherOrder(function() { console.log(""Hello world"") }); JavaScript Interview Questions function higherOrder2() { return function() { return ""Do something""; } } var x = higherOrder2(); x() // Returns ""Do something"""
"13. Explain “this” keyword. The “this” keyword refers to the object that the function is a property of. The value of the “this” keyword will always depend on the object that is invoking the function.\\ Confused? Let’s understand the above statements by examples: function doSomething() { console.log(this); } doSomething(); What do you think the output of the above code will be? Note - Observe the line where we are invoking the function. Check the definition again: The “this” keyword refers to the object that the function is a property of. In the above code, the function is a property of which object? Since the function is invoked in the global context, the function is a property of the global object. Therefore, the output of the above code will be the global object. Since we ran the above code inside the browser, the global object is the window object. Example 2: JavaScript Interview Questions var obj = { name: ""vivek"", getName: function(){ console.log(this.name); } } obj.getName(); In the above code, at the time of invocation, the getName function is a property of the object obj , therefore, this keyword will refer to the object obj, and hence the output will be “vivek”. Example 3: var obj = { name: ""vivek"", getName: function(){ console.log(this.name); } } var getName = obj.getName; var obj2 = {name:""akshay"", getName }; obj2.getName(); Can you guess the output here? The output will be “akshay”. Although the getName function is declared inside the object obj, at the time of invocation, getName() is a property of obj2, therefore the “this” keyword will refer to obj2. The silly way to understand the “this” keyword is, whenever the function is invoked, check the object before the dot. The value of this . keyword will always be the object before the dot. If there is no object before the dot-like in example1, the value of this keyword will be the global object. JavaScript Interview Questions Example 4: var obj1 = { address : ""Mumbai,India"", getAddress: function(){ console.log(this.address); } } var getAddress = obj1.getAddress; var obj2 = {name:""akshay""}; obj2.getAddress(); Can you guess the output? The output will be an error. Although in the code above, this keyword refers to the object obj2, obj2 does not have the property “address”‘, hence the getAddress function throws an error."
"14. What do you mean by Self Invoking Functions? Without being requested, a self-invoking expression is automatically invoked (initiated). If a function expression is followed by (), it will execute automatically. A function declaration cannot be invoked by itself. Normally, we declare a function and call it, however, anonymous functions may be used to run a function automatically when it is described and will not be called again. And there is no name for these kinds of functions."
"15. Explain call(), apply() and, bind() methods."
"1. call(): It’s a predefined method in javascript. This method invokes a method (function) by specifying the owner object. Example 1: JavaScript Interview Questions function sayHello(){ return ""Hello "" + this.name; } var obj = {name: ""Sandy""}; sayHello.call(obj); // Returns ""Hello Sandy"" call() method allows an object to use the method (function) of another object. Example 2: var person = { age: 23, getAge: function(){ return this.age; } } var person2 = {age: 54}; person.getAge.call(person2); // Returns 54 call() accepts arguments: function saySomething(message){ return this.name + "" is "" + message; } var person4 = {name: ""John""}; saySomething.call(person4, ""awesome""); // Returns ""John is awesome"" apply() The apply method is similar to the call() method. The only diﬀerence is that, call() method takes arguments separately whereas, apply() method takes arguments as an array. JavaScript Interview Questions function saySomething(message){ return this.name + "" is "" + message; } var person4 = {name: ""John""}; saySomething.apply(person4, [""awesome""]);"
"2. bind(): This method returns a new function, where the value of “this” keyword will be bound to the owner object, which is provided as a parameter. Example with arguments:"
"16. What is the diﬀerence between exec () and test () methods in javascript? test () and exec () are RegExp expression methods used in javascript. We'll use exec () to search a string for a specific pattern, and if it finds it, it'll return the pattern directly; else, it'll return an 'empty' result. We will use a test () to find a string for a specific pattern. It will return the Boolean value 'true' on finding the given text otherwise, it will return 'false'."
"17. What is currying in JavaScript? Currying is an advanced technique to transform a function of arguments n, to n functions of one or fewer arguments. var bikeDetails = { displayDetails: function(registrationNumber,brandName){ return this.name+ "" , ""+ ""bike details: ""+ registrationNumber + "" , "" + brandName; } } var person1 = {name: ""Vivek""}; var detailsOfPerson1 = bikeDetails.displayDetails.bind(person1, ""TS0122"", ""Bullet""); // Binds the displayDetails function to the person1 object detailsOfPerson1(); // Returns Vivek, bike details: TS0452, Thunderbird JavaScript Interview Questions Example of a curried function: function add (a) { return function(b){ return a + b; } } add(3)(4) For Example, if we have a function f(a,b), then the function a"
"18. What are some advantages of using External JavaScript? JavaScript Interview Questions External JavaScript is the JavaScript Code (script) written in a separate file with the extension.js, and then we link that file inside the <head> or <body> element of the HTML file where the code is to be placed. Some advantages of external javascript are"
1. It allows web designers and developers to collaborate on HTML and javascript files.
2. We can reuse the code.
3. Code readability is simple in external javascript.
"19. Explain Scope and Scope Chain in javascript. Scope in JS determines the accessibility of variables and functions at various parts of one’s code. In general terms, the scope will let us know at a given part of code, what are variables and functions we can or cannot access. There are three types of scopes in JS: Global Scope Local or Function Scope Block Scope Global Scope: Variables or functions declared in the global namespace have global scope, which means all the variables and functions having global scope can be accessed from anywhere inside the code. var globalVariable = ""Hello world""; function sendMessage(){ return globalVariable; // can access globalVariable since it's written in global spac } function sendMessage2(){ return sendMessage(); // Can access sendMessage function since it's written in global } sendMessage2(); // Returns “Hello world” JavaScript Interview Questions Function Scope: Any variables or functions declared inside a function have local/function scope, which means that all the variables and functions declared inside a function, can be accessed from within the function and not outside of it. Block Scope: Block scope is related to the variables declared using let and const. Variables declared with var do not have block scope. Block scope tells us that any variable declared inside a block { }, can be accessed only inside that block and cannot be accessed outside of it. Scope Chain: JavaScript engine also uses Scope to find variables. Let’s understand that using an example: function awesomeFunction(){ var a = 2; var multiplyBy2 = function(){ console.log(a*2); // Can access variable ""a"" since a and multiplyBy2 both are writt } } console.log(a); // Throws reference error since a is written in local scope and cannot multiplyBy2(); // Throws reference error since multiplyBy2 is written in local scope { let x = 45; } console.log(x); // Gives reference error since x cannot be accessed outside of the bloc for(let i=0; i<2; i++){ // do something } console.log(i); // Gives reference error since i cannot be accessed outside of the for JavaScript Interview Questions As you can see in the code above, if the javascript engine does not find the variable in local scope, it tries to check for the variable in the outer scope. If the variable does not exist in the outer scope, it tries to find the variable in the global scope. If the variable is not found in the global space as well, a reference error is thrown."
"20. Explain Closures in JavaScript. Closures are an ability of a function to remember the variables and functions that are declared in its outer scope. var Person = function(pName){ var name = pName; this.getName = function(){ return name; } } var person = new Person(""Neelesh""); console.log(person.getName()); Let’s understand closures by example: var y = 24; function favFunction(){ var x = 667; var anotherFavFunction = function(){ console.log(x); // Does not find x inside anotherFavFunction, so looks for variable } var yetAnotherFavFunction = function(){ console.log(y); // Does not find y inside yetAnotherFavFunction, so looks for varia } anotherFavFunction(); yetAnotherFavFunction(); } favFunction(); JavaScript Interview Questions Let’s understand the code above, The function randomFunc() gets executed and returns a function when we assign it to a variable: var initialiseClosure = randomFunc(); The returned function is then executed when we invoke initialiseClosure: initialiseClosure(); The line of code above outputs “Vivian is awesome” and this is possible because of closure. console.log(obj1.name + "" is ""+ ""awesome""); When the function randomFunc() runs, it seems that the returning function is using the variable obj1 inside it: function randomFunc(){ var obj1 = {name:""Vivian"", age:45}; return function(){ console.log(obj1.name + "" is ""+ ""awesome""); // Has access to obj1 even when the ran } } var initialiseClosure = randomFunc(); // Returns a function initialiseClosure(); JavaScript Interview Questions Therefore randomFunc(), instead of destroying the value of obj1 a"
21. Mention some advantages of javascript. There are many advantages of javascript. Some of them are
"1. Javascript is executed on the client-side as well as server-side also. There are a variety of Frontend Frameworks that you may study and utilize. However, if you want to use JavaScript on the backend, you'll need to learn NodeJS. It is currently the only JavaScript framework that may be used on the backend."
2. Javascript is a simple language to learn.
3. Web pages now have more functionality because of Javascript.
"4. To the end-user, Javascript is quite quick."
"22. What are object prototypes? All javascript objects inherit properties from a prototype. For example, Date objects inherit properties from the Date prototype Math objects inherit properties from the Math prototype Array objects inherit properties from the Array prototype. On top of the chain is Object.prototype. Every prototype inherits properties and methods from the Object.prototype. A prototype is a blueprint of an object. The prototype allows us to use properties and methods on an object even if the properties and methods do not exist on the current object. Let’s see prototypes help us use methods and properties: JavaScript Interview Questions var arr = []; arr.push(2); console.log(arr); // Outputs [2] In the code above, as one can see, we have not defined any property or method called push on the array “arr” but the javascript engine does not throw an error. The reason is the use of prototypes. As we discussed before, Array objects inherit properties from the Array prototype. The javascript engine sees that the method push does not exist on the current array object and therefore, looks for the method push inside the Array prototype and it finds the method. Whenever the property or method is not found on the current object, the javascript engine will always try to look in its prototype and if it still does not exist, it looks inside the prototype's prototype and so on."
23. What are callbacks? JavaScript Interview Questions A callback is a function that will be executed a
24. What are the types of errors in javascript? There are two types of errors in javascript. JavaScript Interview Questions
1. Syntax error: Syntax errors are mistakes or spelling problems in the code that cause the program to not execute at all or to stop running halfway through. Error messages are usually supplied as well.
"2. Logical error: Reasoning mistakes occur when the syntax is proper but the logic or program is incorrect. The application executes without problems in this case. However, the output findings are inaccurate. These are sometimes more diﬀicult to correct than syntax issues since these applications do not display error signals for logic faults."
"25. What is memoization? Memoization is a form of caching where the return value of a function is cached based on its parameters. If the parameter of that function is not changed, the cached version of the function is returned. Let’s understand memoization, by converting a simple function to a memoized function: Note- Memoization is used for expensive function calls but in the following example, we are considering a simple function for understanding the concept of memoization better. Consider the following function: function addTo256(num){ return num + 256; } addTo256(20); // Returns 276 addTo256(40); // Returns 296 addTo256(20); // Returns 276 JavaScript Interview Questions In the code above, we have written a function that adds the parameter to 256 and returns it. When we are calling the function addTo256 again with the same parameter (“20” in the case above), we are computing the result again for the same parameter. Computing the result with the same parameter, again and again, is not a big deal in the above case, but imagine if the function does some heavy-duty work, then, computing the result again and again with the same parameter will lead to wastage of time. This is where memoization comes in, by using memoization we can store(cache) the computed results based on the parameters. If the same parameter is used again while invoking the function, instead of computing the result, we directly return the stored (cached) value. Let’s convert the above function addTo256, to a memoized function: function memoizedAddTo256(){ var cache = {}; return function(num){ if(num in cache){ console.log(""cached value""); return cache[num] } else{ cache[num] = num + 256; return cache[num]; } } } var memoizedFunc = memoizedAddTo256(); memoizedFunc(20); // Normal return memoizedFunc(20); // Cached return In the code above, if we run the memoizedFunc function with the same parameter, instead of computing the result again, it returns the cached result. JavaScript Interview Questions Note- Although using memoization saves time, it results in larger consumption of memory since we are storing all the computed results."
"26. What is recursion in a programming language? Recursion is a technique to iterate over an operation by having a function call itself repeatedly until it arrives at a result. function add(number) { if (number <= 0) { return 0; } else { return number + add(number - 1); } } add(3) => 3 + add(2) 3 + 2 + add(1) 3 + 2 + 1 + add(0) 3 + 2 + 1 + 0 = 6 Example of a recursive function: The following function calculates the sum of all the elements in an array by using recursion: function computeSum(arr){ if(arr.length === 1){ return arr[0]; } else{ return arr.pop() + computeSum(arr); } } computeSum([7, 8, 9, 99]); // Returns 123"
"27. What is the use of a constructor function in javascript? Constructor functions are used to create objects in javascript. When do we use constructor functions? JavaScript Interview Questions If we want to create multiple objects having similar properties and methods, constructor functions are used. Note- The name of a constructor function should always be written in Pascal Notation: every word should start with a capital letter. Example: function Person(name,age,gender){ this.name = name; this.age = age; this.gender = gender; } var person1 = new Person(""Vivek"", 76, ""male""); console.log(person1); var person2 = new Person(""Courtney"", 34, ""female""); console.log(person2); In the code above, we have created a constructor function named Person. Whenever we want to create a new object of the type Person, We need to create it using the new keyword: var person3 = new Person(""Lilly"", 17, ""female""); The above line of code will create a new object of the type Person. Constructor functions allow us to group similar objects."
"28. What is DOM? JavaScript Interview Questions DOM stands for Document Object Model. DOM is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. When the browser tries to render an HTML document, it creates an object based on the HTML document called DOM. Using this DOM, we can manipulate or change various elements inside the HTML document. Example of how HTML code gets converted to DOM:"
"29. Which method is used to retrieve a character from a certain index? The charAt() function of the JavaScript string finds a char element at the supplied index. The index number begins at 0 and continues up to n-1, Here n is the string length. The index value must be positive, higher than, or the same as the string length."
"30. What do you mean by BOM? Browser Object Model is known as BOM. It allows users to interact with the browser. A browser's initial object is a window. As a result, you may call all of the window's functions directly or by referencing the window. The document, history, screen, navigator, location, and other attributes are available in the window object. JavaScript Interview Questions"
"31. What is the distinction between client-side and server-side JavaScript? Client-side JavaScript is made up of two parts, a fundamental language and predefined objects for performing JavaScript in a browser. JavaScript for the client is automatically included in the HTML pages. At runtime, the browser understands this script. Client-side JavaScript is similar to server-side JavaScript. It includes JavaScript that will execute on a server. Only a"
"32. What are arrow functions? Arrow functions were introduced in the ES6 version of javascript. They provide us with a new and shorter syntax for declaring functions. Arrow functions can only be used as a function expression. Let’s compare the normal function declaration and the arrow function declaration in detail: JavaScript Interview Questions // Traditional Function Expression var add = function(a,b){ return a + b; } // Arrow Function Expression var arrowAdd = (a,b) => a + b; Arrow functions are declared without the function keyword. If there is only one returning expression then we don’t need to use the return keyword as well in an arrow function as shown in the example above. Also, for functions having just one line of code, curly braces { } can be omitted. // Traditional function expression var multiplyBy2 = function(num){ return num * 2; } // Arrow function expression var arrowMultiplyBy2 = num => num * 2; If the function takes in only one argument, then the parenthesis () around the parameter can be omitted as shown in the code above. var obj1 = { valueOfThis: function(){ return this; } } var obj2 = { valueOfThis: ()=>{ return this; } } obj1.valueOfThis(); // Will return the object obj1 obj2.valueOfThis(); // Will return window/global object JavaScript Interview Questions The biggest diﬀerence between the traditional function expression and the arrow function is the handling of this keyword. By general definition, this keyword always refers to the object that is calling the function. As you can see in the code above, obj1.valueOfThis() returns obj1 since this keyword refers to the object calling the function. In the arrow functions, there is no binding of this keyword. This keyword inside an arrow function does not refer to the object calling it. It rather inherits its value from the parent scope which is the window object in this case. Therefore, in the code above, obj2.valueOfThis() returns the window object."
"33. What do mean by prototype design pattern? The Prototype Pattern produces diﬀerent objects, but instead of returning uninitialized objects, it produces objects that have values replicated from a template – or sample – object. Also known as the Properties pattern, the Prototype pattern is used to create prototypes. The introduction of business objects with parameters that match the database's default settings is a good example of where the Prototype pattern comes in handy. The default settings for a newly generated business object are stored in the prototype object. The Prototype pattern is hardly used in traditional languages, however, it is used in the development of new objects and templates in JavaScript, which is a prototypal language."
"34. Diﬀerences between declaring variables using var, let and const. Before the ES6 version of javascript, only the keyword var was used to declare variables. With the ES6 Version, keywords let and const were introduced to declare variables. JavaScript Interview Questions keyword const let var global scope no no yes function scope yes yes yes block scope yes yes no can be reassigned no yes yes Let’s understand the diﬀerences with examples: var variable1 = 23; let variable2 = 89; function catchValues(){ console.log(variable1); console.log(variable2); // Both the variables can be accessed anywhere since they are declared in the global sc } window.variable1; // Returns the value 23 window.variable2; // Returns undefined JavaScript Interview Questions The variables declared with the let keyword in the global scope behave just like the variable declared with the var keyword in the global scope. Variables declared in the global scope with var and let keywords can be accessed from anywhere in the code. But, there is one diﬀerence! Variables that are declared with the var keyword in the global scope are added to the window/global object. Therefore, they can be accessed using window.variableName. Whereas, the variables declared with the let keyword are not added to the global object, therefore, trying to access such variables using window.variableName results in an error. var vs let in functional scope function varVsLetFunction(){ let awesomeCar1 = ""Audi""; var awesomeCar2 = ""Mercedes""; } console.log(awesomeCar1); // Throws an error console.log(awesomeCar2); // Throws an error Variables are declared in a functional/local scope using var and let keywords behave exactly the same, meaning, they cannot be accessed from outside of the scope. JavaScript Interview Questions { var variable3 = [1, 2, 3, 4]; } console.log(variable3); // Outputs [1,2,3,4] { let variable4 = [6, 55, -1, 2]; } console.log(variable4); // Throws error for(let i = 0; i < 2; i++){ //Do something } console.log(i); // Throws error for(var j = 0; j < 2; i++){ // Do something } console.log(j) // Outputs 2 In javascript, a block means the code written inside the curly braces {}. Variables declared with var keyword do not have block scope. It means a variable declared in block scope {} with the var keyword is the same as declaring the variable in the global scope. Variables declared with let keyword inside the block scope cannot be accessed from outside of the block. Const keyword Variables with the const keyword behave exactly like a variable declared with the let keyword with only one diﬀerence, any variable declared with the const keyword cannot be reassigned. Example: JavaScript Interview Questions const x = {name:""Vivek""}; x = {address: ""India""}; // Throws an error x.name = ""Nikhil""; // No error is thrown const y = 23; y = 44; // Throws an error In the code above, although we can change the value of a property inside the variable declared with const keyword, we cannot completely reassign the variable itself."
"35. What is the rest parameter and spread operator? Both rest parameter and spread operator were introduced in the ES6 version of javascript. Rest parameter ( … ): It provides an improved way of handling the parameters of a function. Using the rest parameter syntax, we can create functions that can take a variable number of arguments. Any number of arguments will be converted into an array using the rest parameter. It also helps in extracting all or some parts of the arguments. Rest parameters can be used by applying three dots (...) before the parameters. JavaScript Interview Questions function extractingArgs(...args){ return args[1]; } // extractingArgs(8,9,1); // Returns 9 function addAllArgs(...args){ let sumOfArgs = 0; let i = 0; while(i < args.length){ sumOfArgs += args[i]; i++; } return sumOfArgs; } addAllArgs(6, 5, 7, 99); // Returns 117 addAllArgs(1, 3, 4); // Returns 8 **Note- Rest parameter should always be used at the last parameter of a function: // Incorrect way to use rest parameter function randomFunc(a,...args,c){ //Do something } // Correct way to use rest parameter function randomFunc2(a,b,...args){ //Do something } Spread operator (…): Although the syntax of the spread operator is exactly the same as the rest parameter, the spread operator is used to spreading an array, and object literals. We also use spread operators where one or more arguments are expected in a function call. JavaScript Interview Questions function addFourNumbers(num1,num2,num3,num4){ return num1 + num2 + num3 + num4; } let fourNumbers = [5, 6, 7, 8]; addFourNumbers(...fourNumbers); // Spreads [5,6,7,8] as 5,6,7,8 let array1 = [3, 4, 5, 6]; let clonedArray1 = [...array1]; // Spreads the array into 3,4,5,6 console.log(clonedArray1); // Outputs [3,4,5,6] let obj1 = {x:'Hello', y:'Bye'}; let clonedObj1 = {...obj1}; // Spreads and clones obj1 console.log(obj1); let obj2 = {z:'Yes', a:'No'}; let mergedObj = {...obj1, ...obj2}; // Spreads both the objects and merges it console.log(mergedObj); // Outputs {x:'Hello', y:'Bye',z:'Yes',a:'No'}; ***Note- Key diﬀerences between rest parameter and spread operator: Rest parameter is used to take a variable number of arguments and turns them into an array while the spread operator takes an array or an object and spreads it Rest parameter is used in function declaration whereas the spread operator is used in function calls."
"36. In JavaScript, how many diﬀerent methods can you make an object? In JavaScript, there are several ways to declare or construct an object. JavaScript Interview Questions"
1. Object.
2. using Class.
3. create Method.
4. Object Literals.
5. using Function.
6. Object Constructor.
"37. What is the use of promises in javascript? Promises are used to handle asynchronous operations in javascript. Before promises, callbacks were used to handle asynchronous operations. But due to the limited functionality of callbacks, using multiple callbacks to handle asynchronous code can lead to unmanageable code. Promise object has four states - Pending - Initial state of promise. This state represents that the promise has neither been fulfilled nor been rejected, it is in the pending state. Fulfilled - This state represents that the promise has been fulfilled, meaning the async operation is completed. Rejected - This state represents that the promise has been rejected for some reason, meaning the async operation has failed. Settled - This state represents that the promise has been either rejected or fulfilled. A promise is created using the Promise constructor which takes in a callback function with two parameters, resolve and reject respectively. JavaScript Interview Questions resolve is a function that will be called when the async operation has been successfully completed. reject is a function that will be called, when the async operation fails or if some error occurs. Example of a promise: Promises are used to handle asynchronous operations like server requests, for ease of understanding, we are using an operation to calculate the sum of three elements. In the function below, we are returning a promise inside a function: JavaScript Interview Questions function sumOfThreeElements(...elements){ return new Promise((resolve,reject)=>{ if(elements.length > 3 ){ reject(""Only three elements or less are allowed""); } else{ let sum = 0; let i = 0; while(i < elements.length){ sum += elements[i]; i++; } resolve(""Sum has been calculated: ""+sum); } }) } In the code above, we are calculating the sum of three elements, if the length of the elements array is more than 3, a promise is rejected, or else the promise is resolved and the sum is returned. We can consume any promise by attaching then() and catch() methods to the consumer. then() method is used to access the result when the promise is fulfilled. JavaScript Interview Questions catch() method is used to access the result/error when the promise is rejected. In the code below, we are consuming the promise: sumOfThreeElements(4, 5, 6) .then(result=> console.log(result)) .catch(error=> console.log(error)); // In the code above, the promise is fulfilled so the then() method gets executed sumOfThreeElements(7, 0, 33, 41) .then(result => console.log(result)) .catch(error=> console.log(error)); // In the code above, the promise is rejected hence the catch() method gets executed"
"38. What are classes in javascript? Introduced in the ES6 version, classes are nothing but syntactic sugars for constructor functions. They provide a new way of declaring constructor functions in javascript. Below are the examples of how classes are declared and used: JavaScript Interview Questions Key points to remember about classes: Unlike functions, classes are not hoisted. A class cannot be used before it is declared. A class can inherit properties and methods from other classes by using the extend keyword. All the syntaxes inside the class must follow the strict mode(‘use strict’) of javascript. An error will be thrown if the strict mode rules are not followed. // Before ES6 version, using constructor functions function Student(name,rollNumber,grade,section){ this.name = name; this.rollNumber = rollNumber; this.grade = grade; this.section = section; } // Way to add methods to a constructor function Student.prototype.getDetails = function(){ return 'Name: ${this.name}, Roll no: ${this.rollNumber}, Grade: ${this.grade}, Sectio } let student1 = new Student(""Vivek"", 354, ""6th"", ""A""); student1.getDetails(); // Returns Name: Vivek, Roll no:354, Grade: 6th, Section:A // ES6 version classes class Student{ constructor(name,rollNumber,grade,section){ this.name = name; this.rollNumber = rollNumber; this.grade = grade; this.section = section; } // Methods can be directly added inside the class getDetails(){ return 'Name: ${this.name}, Roll no: ${this.rollNumber}, Grade:${this.grade}, Secti } } let student2 = new Student(""Garry"", 673, ""7th"", ""C""); student2.getDetails(); // Returns Name: Garry, Roll no:673, Grade: 7th, Section:C JavaScript Interview Questions"
"39. What are generator functions? Introduced in the ES6 version, generator functions are a special class of functions. They can be stopped midway and then continue from where they had stopped. Generator functions are declared with the function* keyword instead of the normal function keyword: function* genFunc(){ // Perform operation } In normal functions, we use the return keyword to return a value and as soon as the return statement gets executed, the function execution stops: function normalFunc(){ return 22; console.log(2); // This line of code does not get executed } In the case of generator functions, when called, they do not execute the code, instead, they return a generator object. This generator object handles the execution. function* genFunc(){ yield 3; yield 4; } genFunc(); // Returns Object [Generator] {} The generator object consists of a method called next(), this method when called, executes the code until the nearest yield statement, and returns the yield value. For example, if we run the next() method on the above code: genFunc().next(); // Returns {value: 3, done:false} JavaScript Interview Questions As one can see the next method returns an object consisting of a value and done properties. Value property represents the yielded value. Done property tells us whether the function code is finished or not. (Returns true if finished). Generator functions are used to return iterators. Let’s see an example where an iterator is returned: function* iteratorFunc() { let count = 0; for (let i = 0; i < 2; i++) { count++; yield i; } return count; } let iterator = iteratorFunc(); console.log(iterator.next()); // {value:0,done:false} console.log(iterator.next()); // {value:1,done:false} console.log(iterator.next()); // {value:2,done:true} As you can see in the code above, the last line returns done:true, since the code reaches the return statement."
"40. Explain WeakSet in javascript. In javascript, a Set is a collection of unique and ordered elements. Just like Set, WeakSet is also a collection of unique and ordered elements with some key diﬀerences: Weakset contains only objects and no other type. An object inside the weakset is referenced weakly. This means, that if the object inside the weakset does not have a reference, it will be garbage collected. Unlike Set, WeakSet only has three methods, add() , delete() and has() . JavaScript Interview Questions const newSet = new Set([4, 5, 6, 7]); console.log(newSet);// Outputs Set {4,5,6,7} const newSet2 = new WeakSet([3, 4, 5]); //Throws an error let obj1 = {message:""Hello world""}; const newSet3 = new WeakSet([obj1]); console.log(newSet3.has(obj1)); // true"
"41. Why do we use callbacks? A callback function is a method that is sent as an input to another function (now let us name this other function ""thisFunction""), and it is performed inside the thisFunction a"
"42. Explain WeakMap in javascript. In javascript, Map is used to store key-value pairs. The key-value pairs can be of both primitive and non-primitive types. WeakMap is similar to Map with key diﬀerences: The keys and values in weakmap should always be an object. If there are no references to the object, the object will be garbage collected. const map1 = new Map(); map1.set('Value', 1); const map2 = new WeakMap(); map2.set('Value', 2.3); // Throws an error let obj = {name:""Vivek""}; const map3 = new WeakMap(); map3.set(obj, {age:23});"
"43. What is Object Destructuring? Object destructuring is a new way to extract elements from an object or an array. JavaScript Interview Questions Object destructuring: Before ES6 version: const classDetails = { strength: 78, benches: 39, blackBoard:1 } const classStrength = classDetails.strength; const classBenches = classDetails.benches; const classBlackBoard = classDetails.blackBoard; The same example using object destructuring: As one can see, using object destructuring we have extracted all the elements inside an object in one line of code. If we want our new variable to have the same name as the property of an object we can remove the colon: const {strength:strength} = classDetails; // The above line of code can be written as: const {strength} = classDetails; Array destructuring: Before ES6 version: const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]; const first = arr[0]; const second = arr[1]; const third = arr[2]; const fourth = arr[3]; const classDetails = { strength: 78, benches: 39, blackBoard:1 } const {strength:classStrength, benches:classBenches,blackBoard:classBlackBoard} = class console.log(classStrength); // Outputs 78 console.log(classBenches); // Outputs 39 console.log(classBlackBoard); // Outputs 1 JavaScript Interview Questions The same example using object destructuring: const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]; const [first,second,third,fourth] = arr; console.log(first); // Outputs 1 console.log(second); // Outputs 2 console.log(third); // Outputs 3 console.log(fourth); // Outputs 4"
"44. Diﬀerence between prototypal and classical inheritance Programers build objects, which are representations of real-time entities, in traditional OO programming. Classes and objects are the two sorts of abstractions. A class is a generalization of an object, whereas an object is an abstraction of an actual thing. A Vehicle, for example, is a specialization of a Car. As a result, automobiles (class) are descended from vehicles (object). Classical inheritance diﬀers from prototypal inheritance in that classical inheritance is confined to classes that inherit from those remaining classes, but prototypal inheritance allows any object to be cloned via an object linking method. Despite going into too many specifics, a prototype essentially serves as a template for those other objects, whether they extend the parent object or not."
"45. What is a Temporal Dead Zone? Temporal Dead Zone is a behaviour that occurs with variables declared using let and const keywords. It is a behaviour where we try to access a variable before it is initialized. Examples of temporal dead zone: x = 23; // Gives reference error let x; function anotherRandomFunc(){ message = ""Hello""; // Throws a reference error let message; } anotherRandomFunc(); JavaScript Interview Questions In the code above, both in the global scope and functional scope, we are trying to access variables that have not been declared yet. This is called the Temporal Dead Zone."
46. What do you mean by JavaScript Design Patterns? JavaScript design patterns are repeatable approaches for errors that arise sometimes when building JavaScript browser applications. They truly assist us in making our code more stable. They are divided mainly into 3 categories
1. Creational Design Pattern
2. Structural Design Pattern
"3. Behavioral Design Pattern. Creational Design Pattern: The object generation mechanism is addressed by the JavaScript Creational Design Pattern. They aim to make items that are appropriate for a certain scenario. Structural Design Pattern: The JavaScript Structural Design Pattern explains how the classes and objects we've generated so far can be combined to construct bigger frameworks. This pattern makes it easier to create relationships between items by defining a straightforward way to do so. Behavioral Design Pattern: This design pattern highlights typical patterns of communication between objects in JavaScript. As a result, the communication may be carried out with greater freedom."
"47. Is JavaScript a pass-by-reference or pass-by-value language? The variable's data is always a reference for objects, hence it's always pass by value. As a result, if you supply an object and alter its members inside the method, the changes continue outside of it. It appears to be pass by reference in this case. However, if you modify the values of the object variable, the change will not last, demonstrating that it is indeed passed by value. JavaScript Interview Questions"

"49. What are the primitive data types in JavaScript? A primitive is a data type that isn't composed of other data types. It's only capable of displaying one value at a time. By definition, every primitive is a built-in data type (the compiler must be knowledgeable of them) nevertheless, not all built-in datasets are primitives. In JavaScript, there are 5 diﬀerent forms of basic data. The following values are available:"
1. Boolean
2. Undefined
3. Null
4. Number
5. String

"52. What is the purpose of the following JavaScript code? var scope = ""global scope""; function check() { var scope = ""local scope""; function f() { return scope; } return f; } Every executing function, code block, and script as a whole in JavaScript has a related object known as the Lexical Environment. The preceding code line returns the value in scope. JavaScript Coding Interview Questions"
"53. Guess the outputs of the following codes: JavaScript Interview Questions // Code 1: function func1(){ setTimeout(()=>{ console.log(x); console.log(y); },3000); var x = 2; let y = 12; } func1(); // Code 2: function func2(){ for(var i = 0; i < 3; i++){ setTimeout(()=> console.log(i),2000); } } func2(); // Code 3: (function(){ setTimeout(()=> console.log(1),2000); console.log(2); setTimeout(()=> console.log(3),0); console.log(4); })(); Answers: Code 1 - Outputs 2 and 12. Since, even though let variables are not hoisted, due to the async nature of javascript, the complete function code runs before the setTimeout function. Therefore, it has access to both x and y. Code 2 - Outputs 3, three times since variable declared with var keyword does not have block scope. Also, inside the for loop, the variable i is incremented first and then checked. Code 3 - Output in the following order: JavaScript Interview Questions 2 4 3 1 // After two seconds Even though the second timeout function has a waiting time of zero seconds, the javascript engine always evaluates the setTimeout function using the Web API, and therefore, the complete function executes before the setTimeout function can execute."
"54. Guess the outputs of the following code: // Code 1: let x= {}, y = {name:""Ronny""},z = {name:""John""}; x[y] = {name:""Vivek""}; x[z] = {name:""Akki""}; console.log(x[y]); // Code 2: function runFunc(){ console.log(""1"" + 1); console.log(""A"" - 1); console.log(2 + ""-2"" + ""2""); console.log(""Hello"" - ""World"" + 78); console.log(""Hello""+ ""78""); } runFunc(); // Code 3: let a = 0; let b = false; console.log((a == b)); console.log((a === b)); JavaScript Interview Questions Answers: Code 1 - Output will be {name: “Akki”}. Adding objects as properties of another object should be done carefully. Writing x[y] = {name:”Vivek”} , is same as writing x[‘object Object’] = {name:”Vivek”} , While setting a property of an object, javascript coerces the parameter into a string. Therefore, since y is an object, it will be converted to ‘object Object’. Both x[y] and x[z] are referencing the same property. Code 2 - Outputs in the following order: 11 Nan 2-22 NaN Hello78 Code 3 - Output in the following order due to equality coercion: true false"
55. Guess the output of the following code: JavaScript Interview Questions var x = 23; (function(){ var x = 43; (function random(){ x++; console.log(x); var x = 21; })(); })(); Answer: Output is NaN. random() function has functional scope since x is declared and hoisted in the functional scope. Rewriting the random function will give a better idea about the output: function random(){ var x; // x is hoisted x++; // x is not a number since it is not initialized yet console.log(x); // Outputs NaN x = 21; // Initialization of x }

"Web Developer Interview Questions Web Development is a combination of the words i.e., Web (refers to web pages, websites, or anything over the internet) and Development (the act of building such applications from scratch). It entails building and maintaining websites and web- based applications such as social networking sites (like Instagram, Facebook, Linkedin, Twitter, etc.), online eCommerce sites (like Flipkart, Amazon, Myntra, etc.), and many more. This process involves creating a website that looks great, runs smoothly, and has a seamless user experience. Web design, web publishing, web programming, and database management are all part of this process. These are the tasks that web developers, or 'devs', perform using various coding languages. Web Developers must have a good understanding of diﬀerent types of web technologies including HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor), BootStrap, Servlets, JavaScript, etc. The programming languages they use will vary depending on the tasks they are performing and the platform they are using.

"2. List the advantages of HTTP/2 over HTTP 1.1. Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a set of standard protocols allowing internet users to exchange website knowledge on WWW (World Wide Web). HTTP has gone through four iterations since it was introduced in 1991 i.e., HTTP/0.9, HTTP/1.0, HTTP/1.1, and HTTP/2.0. In 2015, HTTP/2 was released as a major revision to HTTP/1.1. HTTP/2.0 has the following advantages over HTTP/1.1: Web Developer Interview Questions Increased performance: It was designed specifically to speed up page loading and reduce round-trip time (RTT) for resource-intensive websites. Handle multiple resources: With HTTP 1.1, the web pages were manageable simply by using HTML markups and images. But with HTTP 2.0, there are now multiple resources available for web pages, including images, fonts, scripts, and more. HTTP 1.1 was not designed to handle such a large amount of resources today. Multiplexing: Multiplexing is fully implemented in HTTP/2. It means that multiple requests are sent between browsers and servers simultaneously over a single TCP connection. Consequently, several elements of a web page can be delivered via a single TCP connection. As a result, the HTTP/1.1 head-of-line blocking problem is resolved, in which a packet at the front of the line blocks the transmission of other packets. Header Compression: HTTP 2.0 has the ability to compress HTTP headers to reduce overhead. When HTML headers on web pages are compressed, they can be sent between the browser and server in one trip, over a single TCP connection. Server push: HTTP/2 servers are able to push resources into a browser's cache even before they are requested. By doing this, browsers can display content without requiring additional requests. Binary protocols: HTTP/2 use binary protocols, not textual. HTML/2's binary protocols consume less bandwidth, can be parsed more eﬀiciently, and are less error-prone compared to HTTP/1.1's textual protocols. Web Developer Interview Questions"
"3. Explain CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) and Write its Importance. CORS stands for Cross-origin resource sharing. It is basically defined as a browser mechanism that enables web pages from one domain to have controlled access to resources that are located at diﬀerent domains (cross-domain request). In other words, it allows scripts running on a browser client to interact with and access resources from other origins. It provides and extends flexibility to the SOP (Same- Origin Policy). A same-origin policy restricts a website's ability to access resources outside its source domain. For example, if a JavaScript app wanted to call an API (Application Programming Interface) running on another domain, it would be blocked and prevented from doing so because of the SOP. Due to restrictions caused by the same-origin policy, CORS was introduced. When a website's CORS policy is set up poorly, it also poses the risk of cross-domain attacks. As such, it cannot prevent cross-origin attacks such as CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)."
"4. What do you mean by ETag (Entity Tag) and how does it work? Web Developer Interview Questions The ETag (entity tag) is a part of the HTTP protocol. This is one of several mechanisms that HTTP provides to validate Web caches, which allows conditional requests to be made from a browser to resources. Moreover, Etags make sure that simultaneous updates of the same resource don't overwrite each other (mid-air collisions). ETags are opaque identifiers assigned by a server to a specific version of a resource found at a specific URL. Every time the resource representation at that URL changes, an entirely new ETag is assigned. As such, ETags can be compared in the same way as fingerprints and determine if two representations of a resource are identical. Syntax: ETag: W/""<etag_value>"" ETag: ""<etag_value>"""
"5. Explain Webpack. Webpack is a tool that bundles JavaScript modules, also known as static module bundlers. Modules are reusable chunks of code that are built from the JavaScript, node_modules, images, and CSS styles of your application, and packaged so that they can be easily added to your website. If you have a large number of files, Webpack generates a single (or a few) file that runs your application. Web Developer Interview Questions When Webpack processes your application or package, it generates a dependency graph, which consists of various modules that your webapp needs in order to function as expected. Based on this graph, it then creates a new package that contains only the bare minimum files required, o"
"6. List out newly introduced input types, APIs, form elements, and elements that support media content in HTML5. List out newly introduced input types, APIs, form elements, and elements that support media content in HTML5. HTML5 has been updated repeatedly in the last few years, and the addition of input types has greatly simplified its use. Among some of these input types are Colour: Enable users to select or choose a colour using the colour picker. Date: Enable users to select or choose a date from a drop-down calendar. Datetime-local: Enable users to select or choose both local date and time. Email: Enable users to enter an email address. Month: Enable users to select or choose a month and year from a drop-down calendar. Week: Enable users to select or choose week and year from a drop-down calendar. HTML5 introduces the following new form elements: <datalist>: Specifies a list of options for input controls. <keygen>: Creates an encryption key. <output>: Defines the result or output of an expression. <progress>: Heads in the direction of 100% of the maximum value. <meter>: Provides a gauge that shows a general value within a range. The following are some of the new APIs introduced in HTML5: Web Developer Interview Questions History API: Provides programs with access to the browser's history. Page visibility API: Enables us to determine the current visibility state of a page. Battery Status API: Displays the current battery status of the device. User Timing API: Provides programmers with high-precision timestamps for measuring application performance. Vibration API: Provides access to the device's vibration functionality. HTML5 includes five elements that support media as follows: <audio>: Used to embed audio files in a web page <video>: Used to embed video files in a web page. <source>: Used for attaching multimedia files, including audio, video, and photos. <embed>: Used to embed external applications, usually multimedia content such as audio or video into an HTML document. <track>: Specifies text tracks for audio and video components."
"7. State the diﬀerence between span tag and div tag in HTML5. Both the div and span tags are used to indicate the part of a web page. Divs are block- level elements, whereas spans are inline elements of a web page. <div> tag is used to show block parts of the webpage whereas <span> tag is used to show inline parts of the webpage: Example: <div>A 6-month online career accelerator program<span>Scaler Academy<span></div> Web Developer Interview Questions <span> tag <div> tag Span tag will be used for inline elements and for paragraphs.Div tags are used for block-level elements. Typically, this tag is used to highlight any specific word ( or a small section of a line) on a webpage.In general, it is used/attached to highlight a section on the webpage. In this tag, we use a specific colour code in order to highlight the HTML content.In this tag, we use borders with height and width with specified colour pixels in order to highlight the HTML content. As it does not support the align attribute, the span tag will not appear on a new line.With support for the align attribute, the div tag will appear on a new line."
"8. Explain HTML5 Web storage. HTML5 has many great features, including Web Storage, which is sometimes referred to as DOM storage (Document Object Model Storage). Web applications can use Web Storage to store data locally in the browser on the user/client’s side. Data is stored in the form of a key/value pair in the user's browser. Using web storage to store data is similar to using cookies, but web storage is faster and more convenient. Web Storage should never be used to store sensitive data. It isn't ""more secure"" than cookies since it isn't transmitted over the wire and isn't encrypted. Web Developer Interview Questions Types of Web Storage: As outlined below, there are two types of web storage with diﬀerent scopes and lifespans: Web Developer Interview Questions Local Storage: This storage uses Windows.localStorage object that stores data with no expiration date. Once stored in local storage, the data will remain available even a"
"9. Explain DOM (Document Object Model)? DOM stands for Document Object Model. It is basically a cross-platform, language- independent API (Application Programming Interface) for XML (Extensible Markup Language) and HTML documents. To put it simply, DOM describes the logical structure of documents and how one can access and manipulate them. For example, here is an HTML document that illustrates the DOM hierarchy. These documents are usually treated as a tree structure in which every node is an object that represents a specific part of the document. In a tree, each branch ends with a node, and each node contains objects. The DOM represents the webpage in a hierarchical structure in order for programmers and users to navigate it more easily."
"10. What do you know about pair programming? Web Developer Interview Questions Pair programming is sometimes referred to as pairing. In pair programming, two programmers work together at one (single) workstation. Those who write code are known as drivers, and those who monitor and navigate each line of code are known as navigators. Both of them may switch roles frequently."
"11. While building a web application, how do you consider SEO, maintainability, UX, performance, and security? Security should be a top priority in any organization that handles vital data. On the other hand, SEO and UX should be prioritized for small and medium-sized online businesses. You will need to pay more attention to performance and SEO if you write an online publication."
"12. State diﬀerence between SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) and Canvas. HTML5 introduced two new graphical elements, Canvas (<canvas>) and SVG (<svg>), that make your web pages more interactive and more graphically attractive. Each has its own properties and can be used to create graphic elements on web pages. Web Developer Interview Questions <svg> tag <canvas> tag In web pages, SVG is used to define vector-based graphics (vector image format). Unlike raster images (ex. .jpg, .gif, .png, etc. ), vector images can be stretched or compressed without losing quality.Canvas is a raster-based format composed of pixels. SVG provides better scalability, enabling high-quality printing at any resolution.The canvas is not suitable for printing at high resolutions since it has poor scalability. Through scripting and CSS, SVG can be modified.Modifying a canvas is only possible through the script. The performance of SVG is better when dealing with fewer objects (<10k) or larger surfaces.Canvas performs better when there is a smaller surface area or a larger number of objects (>10k)."
"13. What is Type Coercion in JavaScript? Web Developer Interview Questions The term type coercion refers to the process of converting values from one data type to another, either automatically or implicitly. For instance, you could convert a number to a string, a string to a number, or a boolean to a number, etc. Example: Number to String Conversion <script> // The Number 5 is converted to // string '5' and then '+' // concatenates both strings const value1 = 5; const value2 = '50'; var x = value1 + value2; document.write(x); </script> Output: 550 The above example shows how JavaScript converted the number 5 into a string and concatenate the values together, resulting in 550."
"14. What is the diﬀerence between and ? It is true that both the <window.onload> and <onDocumentReady> functions perform tasks when the page has been loaded in the browser, however, the execution of the two functions diﬀers slightly. Window.onload: This event is triggered when a web page has fully loaded. In other words, it waits for the DOM and all the associated resources to load, and then executes code. DOM contains all HTML tags, like anchor tag, h1 tag, p tag, etc. onDocumentReady: The ""onDocumentReady"" method, on the other hand, executes the code when the DOM has been loaded. It typically waits for HTML tags, anchor tags, etc., but not for images, videos, or other contents."
"15. Describe the diﬀerent kinds of HTTP requests supported by RESTful Web services. Web Developer Interview Questions Each HTTP request type in RESTful web services has a specific purpose. Below is a description of them: GET: It is used to retrieve data or resources from the server but only allows read- only access. You cannot modify it. POST: It is used for creating a new resource. PUT: This is similar to POST, but used for updating an existing resource (if the resource doesn't exist, the API will decide whether a new resource should be created). DELETE: It is used to delete the resource from the server. TRACE: It validates the content along with the network during an HTTP request. Web Development Interview Questions for Experienced"
"16. What is the best way to integrate diﬀerent stylesheets into a website? Typically, it depends on how your site is laid out and how users interact with it. The most eﬀicient way, however, would be to use just a single file called styles.css (or something similar). Combining them into a single document is preferable. Loading one file is easier for a client than loading five. In order to change the style, you simply open the styles.css file, scroll down to find the appropriate section, and modify the CSS. The sheet can be linked in your HTML as follows: <link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""styles.css"">"
"17. How do you optimize the loading time of your web application as a Web Developer? As a Web Developer, here are the top hacks for reducing load time and optimizing your web application's loading times: Web Developer Interview Questions Image compression and optimization: Using images on your website will improve the appearance and quality of your pages. However, larger images will also slow down the loading process. Compressing and optimizing images is one of the easiest ways to improve the speed of your site. The smaller your images' file sizes, the less weight they have, which, in turn, helps your pages load faster. Put JavaScript and CSS in external files: When JavaScript and CSS are embedded in HTML documents, they are downloaded each time the HTML document is loaded. As a result, this does not utilize browser caching, increasing the size of HTML documents. You should always place CSS and JavaScript in external files; this is best practice and makes maintaining your site easier. Reduce the number of redirects: A website with too many redirects will take a long time to load. HTTP request and response times are prolonged every time a page redirects. If you eliminate unnecessary redirects on your site, your page load time will be significantly reduced. CSS and JavaScript files should be loaded asynchronously: You have CSS and JavaScript files on your website that can be loaded synchronously or asynchronously. In synchronous loading, each file is loaded one at a time, in the order in which it appears on your web page. Asynchronous loading, on the other hand, allows multiple files to be loaded simultaneously, which can speed up the performance of a website. ' Minify HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: Your pages will load faster if you optimize how your files to load. In a similar vein, you can minify your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code. You can reduce the size of files by eliminating unnecessary spaces, characters, comments, and other components. As a result, web pages will load faster with cleaner code."
"18. Define NPM (Node Package Manager). Web Developer Interview Questions NPM stands for Node Package Manager. It is commonly used as a default package manager for Node.js (JavaScript runtime environment). It is included in every installation of Node.js. This command-line tool installs, updates, and uninstalls Node.js packages and modules required for Node applications or projects. A package contains all files for a module, and modules are basically JavaScript libraries that can be added to a Node project as needed. It contains a number of libraries that are extremely useful to Node.js developers, speeding up the process of developing applications. Installing NPM: In order to install NPM, you need to install Node.js as NPM automatically gets with Node.js. Check NPM Version: The following syntax can be used to check the version of NPM that is installed on the system: Syntax: npm -v Update NPM Version: NPM updates refer to updating the Node package manager to its latest version. One may always update the installed version if it is not the latest using the syntax given below: Syntax: npm update [-g] [<pkg>...] The -g flag is used to update npm globally since it is a global package and pkg refers to the package.

"20. Explain the term “Scope” in JavaScript and write its diﬀerent type. Managing the availability of variables or objects in an application is governed by the concept of scope. In JavaScript, there are two types of scope as follows: Global Scope: A variable having global scope can be accessed from anywhere in the program. These variables that are declared outside of any function can be accessed from any place in the program. Example: Web Developer Interview Questions let scalerProgram = ""DataScience"" // code here can use scalerProgram function myScaler() { // code here can also use scalerProgram } Local Scope: Variables with a local scope can only be accessed within the same function in which they are declared. Whenever a variable is declared inside a function, it becomes local to the function. As soon as a function begins, local variables are created and deleted when the function is executed. Example: // code here can NOT use scalerProgram function myScaler() { let scalerProgram = ""DataScience""; // code here CAN use scalerProgram } // code here can NOT use scalerProgram"
"21. State diﬀerence between HTML and XHTML. Both HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and XHTML (Extensible Hypertext Markup Language) can be used to create web-based and Android applications. Web Developer Interview Questions Web Developer Interview Questions HTML XHTML HTML is basically a SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language) application.XHTML is just an XML (Extensible Markup Language) application. It is not case sensitive. It is not necessary to use lower or upper case for tags and attributes.It is case sensitive. This means that every tag and attribute must be lowercase. It is not necessary to mention quotes when using attributes. For e.g., <InterviewBit>.It is necessary to mention quotes when using attributes. For e.g. <InterviewBit=”SCALER”>. .html and .htm are the filename extensions used..xhtml, .xht, and .xml are the filename extensions used.

"29. State diﬀerence between Local Storage and Cookies. The diﬀerences between local storage and cookies are as follows: Web Developer Interview Questions Local Storage Cookies Local storage generally stores large amounts of data on the client's computer (client’s browser) as key-value pairs.Simply put, a cookie is a small text file containing information about a website, like a username or a password. When you visit a particular website, this website saves some information in your local system so that it can recognize you and display results according to your preferences. The client can only access local storage. It is impossible for a server to use local storage unless it deliberately makes a request to the server via GET or POST.Servers and clients are both able to read and write cookies. Local storage has a storage capacity of 5MB/10MB.Cookies have a storage capacity of 4KB. Local storage does not have an expiration date, so it must be manually removed.Cookies have an expiration date and cookie data is purged a"
"30. What is the purpose of Canvas in HTML? In simple terms, Canvas (<canvas> tag) is an HTML element that enables you to draw or create graphics on a web page using JavaScript. This is a new tag in HTML5. Canvas allows you to dynamically control graphics, images, and text on your web pages, adding a great deal of interactivity. You can create graphs, combine photos, and create animated elements using the CANVAS element. Syntax: <canvas id = ""script""> Contents... </canvas> Example: In this example, we have a simple *canvas> element that only has two specific attributes: width (set width of the canvas) and height (set height of the canvas), along with the HTML5 core attributes such as id, name, and class. <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <body> <!-- canvas Tag starts here --> <canvas id = ""InterviewBit"" width = ""100"" height = ""100"" style = ""border:1px solid blue""> </canvas> <!-- canvas Tag ends here --> </body> </html> Or Web Developer Interview Questions <!DOCTYPE HTML> <html> <head> <style> #Interviewbit{border:1px solid blue;} </style> </head> <body> <canvas id = ""Interviewbit"" width = ""100"" height = ""100""></canvas> </body> </html> Output:"
"31. What is the purpose of closures in JavaScript? In JavaScript, a closure is known as a JavaScript closure or JS closure. Closures allow you to access the scope (variables and parameters) of an outer function from an inner function. Every time a JavaScript function is created, a closure is created. JavaScript closures allow you to control which variables are and are not in scope in a given function, as well as which variables are shared among siblings within the same containing scope. Web Developer Interview Questions"
"32. What is an event loop in Node JS? Asynchronous programming in JavaScript is made possible by the event loop. With JS, all operations occur on a single thread, but we can create the illusion of multi- threading by using smart data structures. Event loop takes care of anything that's async using a queue and listener. So, when an async function has to be executed (or an I/O has to be performed), the main thread sends it to another thread, allowing v8 (Javascript engine) to continue running its code. The event loop consists of diﬀerent phases with specific tasks like pending callbacks, close callbacks, timers, idle or prepare, poll, check, with diﬀerent FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queues. Conclusion In an era of economic uncertainty, web development is one of the most promising careers to pursue. In spite of this, web developer interviews can be intimidating, and if you are unprepared, you will become overwhelmed and lose confidence. In order to be competitive, you must be able to have a competitive edge and skill sets that set you apart from the rest. To be successful, you must have a thorough understanding and hands-on experience with integrating new technologies, CSS3, HTML5 APIs, front-end scripting language libraries, and languages like JavaScript, Python, PHP, etc. Furthermore, you must be knowledgeable about configuring applications on web servers and databases, managing SEO keywords, browser compatibility and web security.

"10. What is digest auth in Postman? Digest Authorization is one of the authorization techniques provided by Postman. In this technique, the client first sends the request to the API and get responses from the server including a number which is usable only once, a realm value and 401 unauthorized response. We will be then sent back an encrypted data array having both username and password along with the data received from the server earlier. The server uses this data to generate an encrypted data string and compares this with what was sent for authenticating the request. We can do this by selecting the Authorization tab, then selecting “Digest Auth” from the drop-down list. Postman window presents the fields for both stages of the authentication request. The fields required for the second stage of the request are auto-filled based on the data received from the server. For more information, you can refer here. Postman Interview Questions"
"11. What encoding is accepted by Postman in authorization credentials? Postman accepts authorization credentials in Base64 encoding format only. It is provided in Postman by default. If we do not want to use an inbuilt encoding system, we can refer to third-party websites for converting the credentials in base64 format."
"12. Can we have the same names for global variables in postman? The scope of global variables is limited to the workspace and is global. Due to this, variables having global scope cannot have the same names. We can have the same names for local variables but they need to be part of diﬀerent variables."
"13. What do you know about postman monitor? Postman Interview Questions Monitoring is a method of staying in sync with the health and performance of the APIs. Postman provides inbuilt monitoring services that help us be in sync with the API development and performance. The monitors provided by Postman are mainly based on the working of collection runners. They run every request in the collection and analyze the values mentioned in the test scripts. Monitors use the test scripts for validating and monitoring the responses. The reports generated are shared with the developers over emails or alerts in slack, hipchat, etc based on our configuration settings."
"14. What is a binary form in POST methods? The binary form is designed to help send data in a format that is not possible to be entered manually. These options are used while sending large files like images, CSV files, etc in the POST request. Binary representation is the easiest representation for sending complex data with the request."
"15. What are the limitations of Postman? Postman is not suitable for processing 1000+ API requests. If the project is very large, managing the collections and requests become cumbersome. It is not suitable if we want to manage the workspace in the form of code as there would be a lot of code duplication for dynamic API requests."
16. How can you save the responses of API to a file in Postman? We can do this in two ways:
1. Click on the Download button in the response section.

History also consists of the collection runs that were executed as summarized versions. They are not logged in History as single requests. Click on “View More option (…)” on the request, we will see options to save, document, monitor, delete or mock the request. Multiple requests can be selected by using Command or Control button and then clicking on the request. Postman Interview Questions The following image shows the page that shows when you click on View More Option upon a request present in the History tab: Image Source: Postman Learning Documentation Postman Interview Questions for Experienced"
19. Why is Base64 encoding primarily used in Postman? Base64 encoding is primarily used because it does the task of data transmission in a textual format that is easier to be sent in the requests in HTML form statistics format. Another reason why we use this is that using identical 64 characters for encoding is heavily reliable in any language we use.
"20. What is the purpose of the 304 status code? 304 status code stands for NOT MODIFIED. This is used for diminishing the bandwidth of the network in cases of restricted GET requests. In such cases, the response body should be empty or blank and the headers should have a date, location, signature etc."
"21. Is it preferable to save our work on Postman Cloud? Postman Interview Questions When working on enterprise-level applications for organizations, it is not preferred to store our work on the Postman cloud because of the required privacy and security.

Postman has the following variable scopes: Global Variables: Global variables allow data access between diﬀerent collections, requests, and scripts. They are available throughout the workspace. Environment Variables: These allow us to tailor the requests about diﬀerent development environments - such as local testing, stage testing, or prod testing. Local Variables: These are temporary variables that are accessible only within the scope of requests scripts. They are either scoped to a single request or single collection, depending on the requirements. These variables are not available a"
"23. Is it possible to reuse the authentication token for multiple requests? Yes, it is possible. It can be achieved by creating a collection and adding all the requests having the same authentication token to that collection and then assigning the auth token to the collection. This can be applied to the individual requests by selecting the “Inherit auth from parent” option in the Authorization tab. Postman Interview Questions"
"24. How do you write test cases for basic authentication in Postman? Basic Authentication is one of the authentication techniques provided in Postman that ensures that we can set the username and password along with the API requests. We can do this by first setting the credentials of the API by: Navigating to the Authorization tab. From the dropdown, select Basic Auth. Add the username and password to the API in the input fields given. Postman Interview Questions The test cases can be written as follows: pm.test(""Is the Request Authenticated?"", function () { var jsonData = pm.response.json(); //if authenticated then assert to true pm.expect(jsonData.authenticated).to.eql(true); }); pm.test(""Is the Content-Type present?"", function () { pm.response.to.have.header(""Content-Type""); }); pm.test(""Is it a successful POST Request?"", function () { pm.response.to.have.status(200); });"
"25. How do you set the same headers for all requests in a Postman Collection? Postman collections allow using pre-request scripts at the individual request level and the collection level. We can add any script that applies to all requests in the collection in the pre-request scripts. We can do it by following the below steps: Postman Interview Questions Right-click on the collection, navigate to the pre-request tab. Add the below lines of code in the script to add a request header for all the requests present in the collection. pm.request.headers.add({ key: 'TestHeader', value: 'testValue' }); Click on Update for saving the script. Execute the request in the collection and check if the headers are added to the request in the Postman console. Header from Pre-Request Script:"
"26. What are workspaces in Postman? What are their uses? Workspaces are the areas/space given by Postman for team collaboration to work on a specific or set of collections. It provides a way to logically separate requests or collections that are personal to the developer or the team so that the maintenance of requests is made easy. Postman Interview Questions There are two types of workspaces in Postman: Personal Workspace: These workspaces are useful when we are working simultaneously on multiple projects and we require logical separation between the requests to handle the requests better. Team Workspace: These are created for team collaboration so that more than one person can be part of testing requests. We can invite new users for collaborating on our collections by sharing the email id of the users. Once the invite is accepted, the new users can start contributing to the workspace by adding or modifying the requests. We can create a new workspace by clicking on the Workspace icon and then clicking on “Create New”. We can select our workspace to be personal or team workspace by configuring the properties in the create window. Postman Interview Questions"

28. How will you stop the execution of upcoming requests or execution of the collections? We can use the below code to stop the execution of the next request: pm.setNextRequest(null);
"29. What do you understand by the pre-request script? Pre-request scripts are those scripts that are used for executing Javascript code before a request is run. It is used for performing pre-processing tasks like setting variables, parameters, headers, body data, etc."
"30. How can we use Custom Javascript libraries in our scripts with an example? Postman Interview Questions Postman provides a lot of built-in tools and libraries that we can use to add in our pre-request or post-request scripts or test cases. Let us take the example of using the moment.js library. It provides a lot of useful functions to format data around time. Consider that we have a POST request that needs to specify the created date to the user which expects the format “DD/MM/YYYY”. We can use the moment library to perform this using a single line of code. In our pre-request script, we need to add the below lines of code to get the correctly formatted data and then store that in an environment variable: var moment = require('moment'); pm.environment.set('createdDate',moment().format('DD/MM/YYYY')); There are a lot of other useful libraries like crypto.js that are useful for converting text to encrypted values which can further be used anywhere in the request body."
"31. If we have a global and a local variable of the same name, which one will be given the most preference in Postman? In such cases, the higher precedence is given to the local variable by overwriting the value of the global variable."
"32. Does Postman allow flexibility to make use of the command- line? Postman provides a command-line tool called Newman using which we can run any Postman collection. It is a NodeJS based package that requires a node environment for executing collections using Newman Collection Runner. It has full parity with Postman’s Collection Runner i.e it provides support for running assertions, pre- request scripts, or other request scripts linked with the requests that belong to the collection. We can use Newman by following the below steps: Postman Interview Questions Install Node Install Newman package using npm command as: npm install -g newman To run the collection, first export the environment to JSON format in Postman. Then run the below command for running the collection in Newman: newman run {{path to collection json}} -e {{path to environment json}}"
"33. How will you generate random numbers of a given range in Postman? Suppose you want to generate numbers between the range 1 to N, then it can be done in the pre-request script as follows: pm.globals.set('randomNumber', Math.floor(Math.random() * N)); We can then use this variable in the URL as:{{randomNumber}}"
"34. What do you understand by Scratch Pad? Scratch Pad is a space provided by Postman that helps us to work without being connected to Postman servers. It provides the flexibility of utilizing some of the features of postman oﬀline. The features include- collection creation, creating requests and the ability to send requests. These are stored locally and once logged in, the work is saved into the workspace."
System Design Interview Questions Consistency: This states that the data has to remain consistent a
"2. How is Horizontal scaling diﬀerent from Vertical scaling? System Design Interview Questions Horizontal scaling refers to the addition of more computing machines to the network that shares the processing and memory workload across a distributed network of devices. In simple words, more instances of servers are added to the existing pool and the traﬀic load is distributed across these devices in an eﬀicient manner. Vertical scaling refers to the concept of upgrading the resource capacity such as increasing RAM, adding eﬀicient processors etc of a single machine or switching to a new machine with more capacity. The capability of the server can be enhanced without the need for code manipulation. This has been demonstrated in the image below: Horizontal scaling vs. Vertical scaling: System Design Interview Questions Category Horizontal Scaling Vertical Scaling Load Balancing Requires load balancing for distributing request traﬀic across multiple machines.Since there is just one single machine, the load balancer is not required. Failure Resilience This is more resistant to application failure because if one server fails, traﬀic is routed to other servers.This is more prone to failure as there is only one machine and failure of this results in failure of the entire application. Machine CommunicationSince there are multiple machines being involved, it is very much necessary to have network communication.Vertical scaling makes use of inter-process communication within the machine which makes it quite fast. System Design Interview Questions"
"3. What do you understand by load balancing? Why is it important in system design? Load balancing refers to the concept of distributing incoming traﬀic eﬀiciently across a group of various backend servers. These servers are called server pools. Modern-day websites are designed to serve millions of requests from clients and return the responses in a fast and reliable manner. In order to serve these requests, the addition of more servers is required. In such a scenario, it is essential to distribute request traﬀic eﬀiciently across each server so that they do not face undue loads. Load balancer acts as a traﬀic police cop facing the requests and routes them across the available servers in a way that not a single server is overwhelmed which could possibly degrade the application performance. When a server goes down, the load balancer redirects traﬀic to the remaining available servers. When a new server gets added to the configuration, the requests are automatically redirected to it. Following are the benefits of load balancers: System Design Interview Questions They help to prevent requests from going to unhealthy or unavailable servers. Helps to prevent resources overloading. Helps to eliminate a single point of failure since the requests are routed to available servers whenever a server goes down. Requests sent to the servers are encrypted and the responses are decrypted. It aids in SSL termination and removes the need to install X.509 certificates on every server. Load balancing impacts system security and allows continuous so"
"4. What do you understand by Latency, throughput, and availability of a system? Performance is an important factor in system design as it helps in making our services fast and reliable. Following are the three key metrics for measuring the performance: Latency: This is the time taken in milliseconds for delivering a single message. Throughput: This is the amount of data successfully transmitted through a system in a given amount of time. It is measured in bits per second. Availability: This determines the amount of time a system is available to respond to requests. It is calculated: System Uptime / (System Uptime+Downtime)."
"5. What is Sharding? Sharding is a process of splitting the large logical dataset into multiple databases. It also refers to horizontal partitioning of data as it will be stored on multiple machines. By doing so, a sharded database becomes capable of handling more requests than a single large machine. Consider an example - in the following image, assume that we have around 1TB of data present in the database, when we perform sharding, we divide the large 1TB data into smaller chunks of 256GB into partitions called shards. System Design Interview Questions Sharding helps to scale databases by helping to handle the increased load by providing increased throughput, storage capacity and ensuring high availability."
"6. How is NoSQL database diﬀerent from SQL databases? System Design Interview Questions Category SQL NoSQL Model Follows relational model. Follows the non- relational model. Data Deals with structured data. Deals with semi- structured data. Flexibility SQL follows a strict schema. NoSQL deals with dynamic schema and is very flexible. Transactions Follows ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties.Follows BASE (Basic Availability, So"
"7. How is sharding diﬀerent from partitioning? System Design Interview Questions Database Sharding - Sharding is a technique for dividing a single dataset among many databases, allowing it to be stored across multiple workstations. Larger datasets can be divided into smaller parts and stored in numerous data nodes, boosting the system’s total storage capacity. A sharded database, similarly, can accommodate more requests than a single system by dividing the data over numerous machines. Sharding, also known as horizontal scaling or scale-out, is a type of scaling in which more nodes are added to distribute the load. Horizontal scaling provides near-limitless scalability for handling large amounts of data and high-volume tasks. Database Partitioning - Partitioning is the process of separating stored database objects (tables, indexes, and views) into distinct portions. Large database items are partitioned to improve controllability, performance, and availability. Partitioning can enhance performance when accessing partitioned tables in specific instances. Partitioning can act as a leading column in indexes, reducing index size and increasing the likelihood of finding the most desired indexes in memory. When a large portion of one area is used in the resultset, scanning that region is much faster than accessing data scattered throughout the entire table by index. Adding and deleting sections allows for large-scale data uploading and deletion, which improves performance. Data that are rarely used can be uploaded to more aﬀordable data storage devices. The following table lists the diﬀerences between sharding and partitioning: System Design Interview Questions Sharding Partitioning Sharding is a type of partitioning and is also referred to as horizontal partitioning. Sharding can also be defined as replicating the schema and then dividing the data based on a shard key.A partition is a logical database’s split into separate, independent portions. Database partitioning is commonly used for load balancing, manageability, performance, and availability. System Design Interview Questions"
"8. How is performance and scalability related to each other? A system is said to be scalable if there is increased performance is proportional to the resources added. Generally, performance increase in terms of scalability refers to serving more work units. But this can also mean being able to handle larger work units when datasets grow. If there is a performance problem in the application, then the system will be slow only for a single user. But if there is a scalability problem, then the system may be fast for a single user but it can get slow under heavy user load on the application."
"9. What is Caching? What are the various cache update strategies available in caching? Caching refers to the process of storing file copies in a temporary storage location called cache which helps in accessing data more quickly thereby reducing site latency. The cache can only store a limited amount of data. Due to this, it is important to determine cache update strategies that are best suited for the business requirements. Following are the various caching strategies available: Cache-aside: In this strategy, our application is responsible to write and read data from the storage. Cache interaction with the storage is not direct. Here, the application looks for an entry in the cache, if the result is not found, then the entry is fetched from the database and is added to the cache for further use. Memcached is an example of using this update strategy. System Design Interview Questions Cache-aside strategy is also known as lazy loading because only the requested entry will be cached thereby avoiding unnecessary caching of the data. Some of the disadvantages of this strategy are: In cases of a cache miss, there would be a noticeable delay as it results in fetching data from the database and then caching it. The chances of data being stale are more if it is updated in the database. This can be reduced by defining the time-to-live parameter which forces an update of the cache entry. When a cache node fails, it will be replaced by a new, empty node which results in increased latency. Write-through: In this strategy, the cache will be considered as the main data store by the system and the system reads and writes data into it. The cache then updates the database accordingly as shown in the database. System Design Interview Questions The system adds or updates the entry in the cache. The cache synchronously writes entries to the database. This strategy is overall a slow operation because of the synchronous write operation. However, the subsequent reads of the recently written data will be very fast. This strategy also ensures that the cache is not stale. But, there are chances that the data written in the cache might never be read. This issue can be reduced by providing appropriate TTL. Write-behind (write-back): In this strategy, the application does the following steps: Add or update an entry in the cache Write the entry into the data store asynchronously for improving the write performance. This is demonstrated in the image below: The main disadvantage of this method is that there are chances of data loss if the cache goes down before the contents of the cache are written into the database. Refresh-ahead: Using this strategy, we can configure the cache to refresh the cache entry automatically before its expiration. System Design Interview Questions This cache strategy results in reduced latency if it can predict accurately what items are needed in future."
"10. What are the various Consistency patterns available in system design? Consistency from the CAP theorem states that every read request should get the most recently written data. When there are multiple data copies available, there arises a problem of synchronizing them so that the clients get fresh data consistently. Following are the consistency patterns available: Weak consistency: A"
"11. What do you understand by Content delivery network? Content delivery network or in short CDN is a globally distributed proxy server network that serves content from locations close by to the end-users. Usually, in websites, static files like HTML, CSS, JS files, images and videos are served from CDN. Using CDN in delivering content helps to improve performance: System Design Interview Questions Since users receive data from centres close to them as shown in the image below, they don't have to wait for long. Load on the servers is reduced significantly as some of the responsibility is shared by CDNs. There are two types of CDNs, they are: Push CDNs: Here, the content is received by the CDNs whenever changes occur on the server. The responsibility lies in us for uploading the content to CDNs. Content gets updated to the CDN only when it is modified or added which in turn maximises storage by minimising the traﬀic. Generally, sites with lesser traﬀic or content work well using push CDNs. Pull CDNs: Here new content is grabbed from the server when the first user requests the content from the site. This leads to slower requests for the first time till the content gets stored/cached on the CDN. These CDNs minimizes space utilized on CDN but can lead to redundant traﬀic when expired files are pulled before they are changed. Websites having heavy traﬀic work well when used with pull CDNs."
"12. What do you understand by Leader Election? System Design Interview Questions In a distributed environment where there are multiple servers contributing to the availability of the application, there can be situations where only one server has to take lead for updating third party APIs as diﬀerent servers could cause problems while using the third party APIs. This server is called the primary server and the process of choosing this server is called leader election. The servers in the distributed environment have to detect when the leader server has failed and appoint another one to become a leader. This process is most suitable in high availability and strong consistency based applications by using a consensus algorithm."
"13. How do you answer system design interview questions? Ask questions to the interviewer for clarification: Since the questions are purposefully vague, it is advised to ask relevant questions to the interviewer to ensure that both you and the interviewer are on the same page. Asking questions also shows that you care about the customer requirements. Gather the requirements: List all the features that are required, what are the common problems and system performance parameters that are expected by the system to handle. This step helps the interviewer to see how well you plan, expect problems and come up with solutions to each of them. Every choice matters while designing a system. For every choice, at least one pros and cons of the system needs to be listed. Come up with a design: Come up with a high-level design and low-level design solutions for each of the requirements decided. Discuss the pros and cons of the design. Also, discuss how they are beneficial to the business.

This becomes an issue while designing distributed applications Openness: Openness represents the measure by which a system can be extended and re-implemented in diﬀerent ways. In distributed systems, it specifies the degree to which new sharing services can be added and made available for client usage. Security: The information maintained in distributed systems need to be secure as they are valuable to the users. The confidentiality, availability and integrity of the distributed systems have to be maintained and this sometimes becomes a challenge. Scalability: A system is scalable if it remains eﬀective when there is a significant increase in the request traﬀic and resources. Designing a distributed system involves planning well in advance how well the system can be made scalable under varying user loads. Failure Handling: In a distributed environment, the failures are partial, meaning if some components fail, others would still function. It becomes challenging to handle these failures as it involves identifying right components where the failures occur. System Design Interview Questions for Experienced"

"34. What are multiple inheritances in Java? Multiple inheritances are a way of passing on multiple copies of a particular class or interface to a child's class. This can be useful when you want to make sure that some code is always available to your child's classes. One way to do this is to create a subclass of the parent class, and then provide the child with a copy of the parent class. Another way is to create multiple inheritances in your Java code, and then provide the child with a reference to the parent class. Multiple inheritances are useful for situations where you need to make sure that some code is always available to your child's classes. In Java, multiple inheritances are implemented using the public and private modifiers on a class or interface. When multiple inheritances are present, the public modifier indicates that the class or interface is publically accessible. The private modifier indicates that the class or interface is privately accessible. Multiple inheritances can be useful when you want to make sure that some code is always available to your child's classes. Computer Science Interview Questions"
"35. What is Cache? A cache is a temporary storage location for frequently accessed data. Caches are useful for organizations that need to store large amounts of data in a short amount of time. They can also be used to improve performance by reducing the amount of data that needs to be retrieved from the network. Caches can be used to store data in several diﬀerent ways. They can be used to store data that is frequently accessed, such as documents or images. They can also be used to store data that is rarely accessed, such as log files or application states. They can also be used to store data that is needed only occasionally, such as temporary files or cookies. Computer Science Interview Questions"
"36. What is Deadlock? A deadlock is a situation where two or more processes are waiting for each other to finish. Deadlock occurs when one process is waiting for another process to finish before it can continue. The process that is waiting will not finish until the other process finishes. This can be a problem if you need to wait for a long time, as this can lead to your system becoming unresponsive. Computer Science Interview Questions"
"37. What is a Critical Section? A critical section is a section of code that is crucial to the operation of a program. By accessing critical sections, a program can make changes to the overall functionality of the program without aﬀecting other sections of code. Critical sections are o"
"38. What is Multithreading? Multithreading is a technique that allows multiple threads to run in parallel on a single processor. This allows multiple tasks to be run in parallel without the need for synchronization. In addition, multithreading can improve performance by allowing tasks to run in parallel without having to wait for each other to finish. For example, it is not appropriate for applications that require high performance or when the processor cannot support more than one thread at a time. Multithreading also has its own set of risks and pitfalls. For example, multithreading can lead to increased system load and increased system resource consumption."
"39. What is normalization in a Database? Normalization is a process of abstracting and simplifying data. It is a way of making data easier to understand and easier to work with. For example, if you have a data set that contains a lot of numbers, you can normalize it by taking the numbers and breaking them down into smaller pieces, such as by dividing by 10. This makes it easier to work with the data and makes it easier to see trends and patterns. You can also normalize your data by making it more consistent."
"40. What is Indexing in DBMS? Computer Science Interview Questions Indexing is the process of organizing data in a way that makes it easier to find and access. In a database, the index is a collection of data organized in a way that makes it easy to search and find data. The index consists of a set of key-value pairs that can be used to reference data in the database. The indexing process can involve many diﬀerent techniques, including the use of indexes, data structures, and algorithms. In a database, the index is a collection of data organized in a way that makes it easy to search and find data."

"42. What is TCP? TCP stands for Transmission Control Protocol. TCP is a networking protocol that is used to transfer data between computers. TCP is a connection-oriented protocol that allows two computers to establish a connection with each other. TCP also allows two computers to send and receive data. The main purpose of TCP is to keep the data transferred between two computers connected. This is done by ensuring that data packets are sent and received in a timely manner. TCP also provides several other functions, such as error detection and recovery, congestion control, and reliability. Computer Science Interview Questions"
"43. Explain DNS? DNS is the acronym for Domain Name System. It's a way of mapping domain names to IP addresses. The IP address is a number that's assigned to each device that connects to the Internet. When you type in a domain name, your computer sends a request to the DNS server, which looks up the corresponding IP address. The DNS server then returns a response that includes the domain name and an associated IP address. This process is called name resolution. DNS is used by most websites and services that use the Internet. It's also used by email services like Gmail and Yahoo Mail, as well as by many online services like shopping sites and online banking services. Computer Science Interview Questions"
"44. What are the Application layer protocols? The Application layer protocols are the protocols that are used to connect applications to the network. These protocols are responsible for transferring data between applications and the network, such as TCP/IP, HTTP, and FTP. The Application layer protocols are also responsible for handling security and privacy. For example, the HTTP protocol is used to transfer data between web pages and the network. The HTTP protocol is also used to protect privacy by encrypting data before it is sent over the network. Computer Science Interview Questions"
"45. What are the keys in DBMS? There are four main keys to a database management system (DBMS): data, integrity, availability, and management. Data is the information stored in the database. Integrity is the ability of the database to prevent the corruption of data. Availability is the ability of the database to provide access to data when needed. Management is the ability of the database to provide tools for administrators and users. In addition, there are many other factors that are important in choosing a DBMS, such as a price, performance, and ease of use. Conclusion Computer Science Interview Questions These articles provide a summary of some of the most common interview questions that you may encounter in your career search.

SQL Interview Questions SQL Interview Questions
"1. What is Database? A database is an organized collection of data, stored and retrieved digitally from a remote or local computer system. Databases can be vast and complex, and such databases are developed using fixed design and modeling approaches."
2. What is DBMS? DBMS stands for Database Management System. DBMS is a system so
"3. What is RDBMS? How is it diﬀerent from DBMS? RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System. The key diﬀerence here, compared to DBMS, is that RDBMS stores data in the form of a collection of tables, and relations can be defined between the common fields of these tables. Most modern database management systems like MySQL, Microso"
4. What is SQL? SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It is the standard language for relational database management systems. It is especially useful in handling organized data comprised of entities (variables) and relations between diﬀerent entities of the data. SQL Interview Questions
"5. What is the diﬀerence between SQL and MySQL? SQL is a standard language for retrieving and manipulating structured databases. On the contrary, MySQL is a relational database management system, like SQL Server, Oracle or IBM DB2, that is used to manage SQL databases."
6. What are Tables and Fields? A table is an organized collection of data stored in the form of rows and columns. Columns can be categorized as vertical and rows as horizontal. The columns in a table are called fields while the rows can be referred to as records.
7. What are Constraints in SQL? Constraints are used to specify the rules concerning data in the table. It can be applied for single or multiple fields in an SQL table during the creation of the table or a
"8. What is a Primary Key? SQL Interview Questions The PRIMARY KEY constraint uniquely identifies each row in a table. It must contain UNIQUE values and has an implicit NOT NULL constraint. A table in SQL is strictly restricted to have one and only one primary key, which is comprised of single or multiple fields (columns). CREATE TABLE Students ( /* Create table with a single field as primary key */ ID INT NOT NULL Name VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY (ID) ); CREATE TABLE Students ( /* Create table with multiple fields as primary key */ ID INT NOT NULL LastName VARCHAR(255) FirstName VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL, CONSTRAINT PK_Student PRIMARY KEY (ID, FirstName) ); ALTER TABLE Students /* Set a column as primary key */ ADD PRIMARY KEY (ID); ALTER TABLE Students /* Set multiple columns as primary key */ ADD CONSTRAINT PK_Student /*Naming a Primary Key*/ PRIMARY KEY (ID, FirstName); write a sql statement to add primary key 't_id' to the table 'teachers'. C h e c k Write a SQL statement to add primary key constraint 'pk_a' for table 'table_a' and fields 'col_b, col_c'. C h e c k9. What is a UNIQUE constraint? A UNIQUE constraint ensures that all values in a column are diﬀerent. This provides uniqueness for the column(s) and helps identify each row uniquely. Unlike primary key, there can be multiple unique constraints defined per table. The code syntax for UNIQUE is quite similar to that of PRIMARY KEY and can be used interchangeably. SQL Interview Questions CREATE TABLE Students ( /* Create table with a single field as unique */ ID INT NOT NULL UNIQUE Name VARCHAR(255) ); CREATE TABLE Students ( /* Create table with multiple fields as unique */ ID INT NOT NULL LastName VARCHAR(255) FirstName VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL CONSTRAINT PK_Student UNIQUE (ID, FirstName) ); ALTER TABLE Students /* Set a column as unique */ ADD UNIQUE (ID); ALTER TABLE Students /* Set multiple columns as unique */ ADD CONSTRAINT PK_Student /* Naming a unique constraint */ UNIQUE (ID, FirstName);"
"10. What is a Foreign Key? A FOREIGN KEY comprises of single or collection of fields in a table that essentially refers to the PRIMARY KEY in another table. Foreign key constraint ensures referential integrity in the relation between two tables. The table with the foreign key constraint is labeled as the child table, and the table containing the candidate key is labeled as the referenced or parent table. CREATE TABLE Students ( /* Create table with foreign key - Way 1 */ ID INT NOT NULL Name VARCHAR(255) LibraryID INT PRIMARY KEY (ID) FOREIGN KEY (Library_ID) REFERENCES Library(LibraryID) ); CREATE TABLE Students ( /* Create table with foreign key - Way 2 */ ID INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY Name VARCHAR(255) LibraryID INT FOREIGN KEY (Library_ID) REFERENCES Library(LibraryID) ); ALTER TABLE Students /* Add a new foreign key */ ADD FOREIGN KEY (LibraryID) REFERENCES Library (LibraryID); SQL Interview Questions What type of integrity constraint does the foreign key ensure? C h e c k Write a SQL statement to add a FOREIGN KEY 'col_fk' in 'table_y' that references 'col_pk' in 'table_x'. C h e c k11. What is a Join? List its diﬀerent types. The SQL Join clause is used to combine records (rows) from two or more tables in a SQL database based on a related column between the two. There are four diﬀerent types of JOINs in SQL: (INNER) JOIN: Retrieves records that have matching values in both tables involved in the join. This is the widely used join for queries. SQL Interview Questions SELECT * FROM Table_A JOIN Table_B; SELECT * FROM Table_A INNER JOIN Table_B; LEFT (OUTER) JOIN: Retrieves all the records/rows from the le"
"12. What is a Self-Join? A self JOIN is a case of regular join where a table is joined to itself based on some relation between its own column(s). Self-join uses the INNER JOIN or LEFT JOIN clause and a table alias is used to assign diﬀerent names to the table within the query. SQL Interview Questions SELECT A.emp_id AS ""Emp_ID"",A.emp_name AS ""Employee"", B.emp_id AS ""Sup_ID"",B.emp_name AS ""Supervisor"" FROM employee A, employee B WHERE A.emp_sup = B.emp_id;"
13. What is a Cross-Join? Cross join can be defined as a cartesian product of the two tables included in the join. The table a
"14. What is an Index? Explain its diﬀerent types. A database index is a data structure that provides a quick lookup of data in a column or columns of a table. It enhances the speed of operations accessing data from a database table at the cost of additional writes and memory to maintain the index data structure. CREATE INDEX index_name /* Create Index */ ON table_name (column_1, column_2); DROP INDEX index_name; /* Drop Index */ There are diﬀerent types of indexes that can be created for diﬀerent purposes: Unique and Non-Unique Index: Unique indexes are indexes that help maintain data integrity by ensuring that no two rows of data in a table have identical key values. Once a unique index has been defined for a table, uniqueness is enforced whenever keys are added or changed within the index. CREATE UNIQUE INDEX myIndex ON students (enroll_no); Non-unique indexes, on the other hand, are not used to enforce constraints on the tables with which they are associated. Instead, non-unique indexes are used solely to improve query performance by maintaining a sorted order of data values that are used frequently. Clustered and Non-Clustered Index: Clustered indexes are indexes whose order of the rows in the database corresponds to the order of the rows in the index. This is why only one clustered index can exist in a given table, whereas, multiple non-clustered indexes can exist in the table. SQL Interview Questions The only diﬀerence between clustered and non-clustered indexes is that the database manager attempts to keep the data in the database in the same order as the corresponding keys appear in the clustered index. Clustering indexes can improve the performance of most query operations because they provide a linear-access path to data stored in the database. Write a SQL statement to create a UNIQUE INDEX ""my_index"" on ""my_table"" for fields ""column_1"" & ""column_2"". C h e c k"
"15. What is the diﬀerence between Clustered and Non-clustered index? As explained above, the diﬀerences can be broken down into three small factors - Clustered index modifies the way records are stored in a database based on the indexed column. A non-clustered index creates a separate entity within the table which references the original table. Clustered index is used for easy and speedy retrieval of data from the database, whereas, fetching records from the non-clustered index is relatively slower. In SQL, a table can have a single clustered index whereas it can have multiple non-clustered indexes."
"16. What is Data Integrity? Data Integrity is the assurance of accuracy and consistency of data over its entire life- cycle and is a critical aspect of the design, implementation, and usage of any system which stores, processes, or retrieves data. It also defines integrity constraints to enforce business rules on the data when it is entered into an application or a database."
"17. What is a Query? A query is a request for data or information from a database table or combination of tables. A database query can be either a select query or an action query. SQL Interview Questions SELECT fname, lname /* select query */ FROM myDb.students WHERE student_id = 1; UPDATE myDB.students /* action query */ SET fname = 'Captain', lname = 'America' WHERE student_id = 1;"
"18. What is a Subquery? What are its types? A subquery is a query within another query, also known as a nested query or inner query. It is used to restrict or enhance the data to be queried by the main query, thus restricting or enhancing the output of the main query respectively. For example, here we fetch the contact information for students who have enrolled for the maths subject: SELECT name, email, mob, address FROM myDb.contacts WHERE roll_no IN ( SELECT roll_no FROM myDb.students WHERE subject = 'Maths'); There are two types of subquery - Correlated and Non-Correlated. A correlated subquery cannot be considered as an independent query, but it can refer to the column in a table listed in the FROM of the main query. A non-correlated subquery can be considered as an independent query and the output of the subquery is substituted in the main query. Write a SQL query to update the field ""status"" in table ""applications"" from 0 to 1. C h e c k SQL Interview Questions Write a SQL query to select the field ""app_id"" in table ""applications"" where ""app_id"" less than 1000. C h e c k Write a SQL query to fetch the field ""app_name"" from ""apps"" where ""apps.id"" is equal to the above collection of ""app_id"". C h e c k"
"19. What is the SELECT statement? SELECT operator in SQL is used to select data from a database. The data returned is stored in a result table, called the result-set. SELECT * FROM myDB.students;"
"20. What are some common clauses used with SELECT query in SQL? Some common SQL clauses used in conjuction with a SELECT query are as follows: WHERE clause in SQL is used to filter records that are necessary, based on specific conditions. ORDER BY clause in SQL is used to sort the records based on some field(s) in ascending (ASC) or descending order (DESC). SELECT * FROM myDB.students WHERE graduation_year = 2019 ORDER BY studentID DESC; SQL Interview Questions GROUP BY clause in SQL is used to group records with identical data and can be used in conjunction with some aggregation functions to produce summarized results from the database. HAVING clause in SQL is used to filter records in combination with the GROUP BY clause. It is diﬀerent from WHERE, since the WHERE clause cannot filter aggregated records. SELECT COUNT(studentId), country FROM myDB.students WHERE country != ""INDIA"" GROUP BY country HAVING COUNT(studentID) > 5;"
"21. What are UNION, MINUS and INTERSECT commands? The UNION operator combines and returns the result-set retrieved by two or more SELECT statements. The MINUS operator in SQL is used to remove duplicates from the result-set obtained by the second SELECT query from the result-set obtained by the first SELECT query and then return the filtered results from the first. The INTERSECT clause in SQL combines the result-set fetched by the two SELECT statements where records from one match the other and then returns this intersection of result-sets. Certain conditions need to be met before executing either of the above statements in SQL - Each SELECT statement within the clause must have the same number of columns The columns must also have similar data types The columns in each SELECT statement should necessarily have the same order SQL Interview Questions SELECT name FROM Students /* Fetch the union of queries */ UNION SELECT name FROM Contacts; SELECT name FROM Students /* Fetch the union of queries with duplicates*/ UNION ALL SELECT name FROM Contacts; SELECT name FROM Students /* Fetch names from students */ MINUS /* that aren't present in contacts */ SELECT name FROM Contacts; SELECT name FROM Students /* Fetch names from students */ INTERSECT /* that are present in contacts as well */ SELECT name FROM Contacts; Write a SQL query to fetch ""names"" that are present in either table ""accounts"" or in table ""registry"". C h e c k Write a SQL query to fetch ""names"" that are present in ""accounts"" but not in table ""registry"". C h e c k Write a SQL query to fetch ""names"" from table ""contacts"" that are neither present in ""accounts.name"" nor in ""registry.name"". C h e c k22. What is Cursor? How to use a Cursor? A database cursor is a control structure that allows for the traversal of records in a database. Cursors, in addition, facilitates processing a"
1. DECLARE a cursor a
2. Open cursor to initialize the result set. The OPEN statement must be called before fetching rows from the result set.
3. FETCH statement to retrieve and move to the next row in the result set.
4. Call the CLOSE statement to deactivate the cursor.
"5. Finally use the DEALLOCATE statement to delete the cursor definition and release the associated resources. DECLARE @name VARCHAR(50) /* Declare All Required Variables */ DECLARE db_cursor CURSOR FOR /* Declare Cursor Name*/ SELECT name FROM myDB.students WHERE parent_name IN ('Sara', 'Ansh') OPEN db_cursor /* Open cursor and Fetch data into @name */ FETCH next FROM db_cursor INTO @name CLOSE db_cursor /* Close the cursor and deallocate the resources */ DEALLOCATE db_cursor"
"23. What are Entities and Relationships? Entity: An entity can be a real-world object, either tangible or intangible, that can be easily identifiable. For example, in a college database, students, professors, workers, departments, and projects can be referred to as entities. Each entity has some associated properties that provide it an identity. Relationships: Relations or links between entities that have something to do with each other. For example - The employee's table in a company's database can be associated with the salary table in the same database. SQL Interview Questions"
24. List the diﬀerent types of relationships in SQL. One-to-One - This can be defined as the relationship between two tables where each record in one table is associated with the maximum of one record in the other table. One-to-Many & Many-to-One - This is the most commonly used relationship where a record in a table is associated with multiple records in the other table. Many-to-Many - This is used in cases when multiple instances on both sides are needed for defining a relationship. Self-Referencing Relationships - This is used when a table needs to define a relationship with itself.
"25. What is an Alias in SQL? An alias is a feature of SQL that is supported by most, if not all, RDBMSs. It is a temporary name assigned to the table or table column for the purpose of a particular SQL query. In addition, aliasing can be employed as an obfuscation technique to secure the real names of database fields. A table alias is also called a correlation name. SQL Interview Questions An alias is represented explicitly by the AS keyword but in some cases, the same can be performed without it as well. Nevertheless, using the AS keyword is always a good practice. SELECT A.emp_name AS ""Employee"" /* Alias using AS keyword */ B.emp_name AS ""Supervisor"" FROM employee A, employee B /* Alias without AS keyword */ WHERE A.emp_sup = B.emp_id; Write an SQL statement to select all from table ""Limited"" with alias ""Ltd"". C h e c k26. What is a View? A view in SQL is a virtual table based on the result-set of an SQL statement. A view contains rows and columns, just like a real table. The fields in a view are fields from one or more real tables in the database."
"27. What is Normalization? SQL Interview Questions Normalization represents the way of organizing structured data in the database eﬀiciently. It includes the creation of tables, establishing relationships between them, and defining rules for those relationships. Inconsistency and redundancy can be kept in check based on these rules, hence, adding flexibility to the database."
"28. What is Denormalization? Denormalization is the inverse process of normalization, where the normalized schema is converted into a schema that has redundant information. The performance is improved by using redundancy and keeping the redundant data consistent. The reason for performing denormalization is the overheads produced in the query processor by an over-normalized structure."
"29. What are the various forms of Normalization? Normal Forms are used to eliminate or reduce redundancy in database tables. The diﬀerent forms are as follows: First Normal Form: A relation is in first normal form if every attribute in that relation is a single- valued attribute. If a relation contains a composite or multi-valued attribute, it violates the first normal form. Let's consider the following students table. Each student in the table, has a name, his/her address, and the books they issued from the public library - Students Table SQL Interview Questions Student Address Books Issued Salutation Sara Amanora Park Town 94 Until the Day I Die (Emily Carpenter), Inception (Christopher Nolan)Ms. Ansh62nd Sector A- 10 The Alchemist (Paulo Coelho), Inferno (Dan Brown) Mr. Sara 24th Street Park Avenue Beautiful Bad (Annie Ward), Woman 99 (Greer Macallister)Mrs. Ansh Windsor Street 777 Dracula (Bram Stoker)Mr. As we can observe, the Books Issued field has more than one value per record, and to convert it into 1NF, this has to be resolved into separate individual records for each book issued. Check the following table in 1NF form - Students Table (1st Normal Form) SQL Interview Questions Student Address Books Issued Salutation SaraAmanora Park Town 94Until the Day I Die (Emily Carpenter) Ms. SaraAmanora Park Town 94Inception (Christopher Nolan) Ms. Ansh62nd Sector A- 10The Alchemist (Paulo Coelho) Mr. Ansh62nd Sector A- 10Inferno (Dan Brown) Mr. Sara24th Street Park AvenueBeautiful Bad (Annie Ward) Mrs. Sara24th Street Park AvenueWoman 99 (Greer Macallister) Mrs. AnshWindsor Street 777Dracula (Bram Stoker) Mr. SQL Interview Questions Second Normal Form: A relation is in second normal form if it satisfies the conditions for the first normal form and does not contain any partial dependency. A relation in 2NF has no partial dependency, i.e., it has no non-prime attribute that depends on any proper subset of any candidate key of the table. O"
"30. What are the TRUNCATE, DELETE and DROP statements? DELETE statement is used to delete rows from a table. DELETE FROM Candidates WHERE CandidateId > 1000; TRUNCATE command is used to delete all the rows from the table and free the space containing the table. TRUNCATE TABLE Candidates; DROP command is used to remove an object from the database. If you drop a table, all the rows in the table are deleted and the table structure is removed from the database. DROP TABLE Candidates; SQL Interview Questions Write a SQL statement to wipe a table 'Temporary' from memory. C h e c k Write a SQL query to remove first 1000 records from table 'Temporary' based on 'id'. C h e c k Write a SQL statement to delete the table 'Temporary' while keeping its relations intact. C h e c k31. What is the diﬀerence between DROP and TRUNCATE statements? If a table is dropped, all things associated with the tables are dropped as well. This includes - the relationships defined on the table with other tables, the integrity checks and constraints, access privileges and other grants that the table has. To create and use the table again in its original form, all these relations, checks, constraints, privileges and relationships need to be redefined. However, if a table is truncated, none of the above problems exist and the table retains its original structure."
32. What is the diﬀerence between DELETE and TRUNCATE statements? The TRUNCATE command is used to delete all the rows from the table and free the space containing the table. The DELETE command deletes only the rows from the table based on the condition given in the where clause or deletes all the rows from the table if no condition is specified. But it does not free the space containing the table.
33. What are Aggregate and Scalar functions? SQL Interview Questions An aggregate function performs operations on a collection of values to return a single scalar value. Aggregate functions are o
"34. What is User-defined function? What are its various types? The user-defined functions in SQL are like functions in any other programming language that accept parameters, perform complex calculations, and return a value. They are written to use the logic repetitively whenever required. There are two types of SQL user-defined functions: SQL Interview Questions Scalar Function: As explained earlier, user-defined scalar functions return a single scalar value. Table-Valued Functions: User-defined table-valued functions return a table as output. Inline: returns a table data type based on a single SELECT statement. Multi-statement: returns a tabular result-set but, unlike inline, multiple SELECT statements can be used inside the function body."

"36. What are the diﬀerences between OLTP and OLAP? SQL Interview Questions OLTP stands for Online Transaction Processing, is a class of so"
"37. What is Collation? What are the diﬀerent types of Collation Sensitivity? SQL Interview Questions Collation refers to a set of rules that determine how data is sorted and compared. Rules defining the correct character sequence are used to sort the character data. It incorporates options for specifying case sensitivity, accent marks, kana character types, and character width. Below are the diﬀerent types of collation sensitivity: Case sensitivity: A and a are treated diﬀerently. Accent sensitivity: a and á are treated diﬀerently. Kana sensitivity: Japanese kana characters Hiragana and Katakana are treated diﬀerently. Width sensitivity: Same character represented in single-byte (half-width) and double-byte (full-width) are treated diﬀerently."
38. What is a Stored Procedure? A stored procedure is a subroutine available to applications that access a relational database management system (RDBMS). Such procedures are stored in the database data dictionary. The sole disadvantage of stored procedure is that it can be executed nowhere except in the database and occupies more memory in the database server. It also provides a sense of security and functionality as users who can't access the data directly can be granted access via stored procedures. DELIMITER $$ CREATE PROCEDURE FetchAllStudents() BEGIN SELECT * FROM myDB.students; END $$ DELIMITER ; SQL Interview Questions
"39. What is a Recursive Stored Procedure? A stored procedure that calls itself until a boundary condition is reached, is called a recursive stored procedure. This recursive function helps the programmers to deploy the same set of code several times as and when required. Some SQL programming languages limit the recursion depth to prevent an infinite loop of procedure calls from causing a stack overflow, which slows down the system and may lead to system crashes. DELIMITER $$ /* Set a new delimiter => $$ */ CREATE PROCEDURE calctotal( /* Create the procedure */ IN number INT, /* Set Input and Ouput variables */ OUT total INT ) BEGIN DECLARE score INT DEFAULT NULL; /* Set the default value => ""score"" */ SELECT awards FROM achievements /* Update ""score"" via SELECT query */ WHERE id = number INTO score; IF score IS NULL THEN SET total = 0; /* Termination condition */ ELSE CALL calctotal(number+1); /* Recursive call */ SET total = total + score; /* Action after recursion */ END IF; END $$ /* End of procedure */ DELIMITER ; /* Reset the delimiter */ SQL Interview Questions"
"40. How to create empty tables with the same structure as another table? Creating empty tables with the same structure can be done smartly by fetching the records of one table into a new table using the INTO operator while fixing a WHERE clause to be false for all records. Hence, SQL prepares the new table with a duplicate structure to accept the fetched records but since no records get fetched due to the WHERE clause in action, nothing is inserted into the new table. SELECT * INTO Students_copy FROM Students WHERE 1 = 2;"
"41. What is Pattern Matching in SQL? SQL pattern matching provides for pattern search in data if you have no clue as to what that word should be. This kind of SQL query uses wildcards to match a string pattern, rather than writing the exact word. The LIKE operator is used in conjunction with SQL Wildcards to fetch the required information. Using the % wildcard to perform a simple search The % wildcard matches zero or more characters of any type and can be used to define wildcards both before and a"
"42. What is PostgreSQL? SQL Interview Questions PostgreSQL was first called Postgres and was developed by a team led by Computer Science Professor Michael Stonebraker in 1986. It was developed to help developers build enterprise-level applications by upholding data integrity by making systems fault-tolerant. PostgreSQL is therefore an enterprise-level, flexible, robust, open- source, and object-relational DBMS that supports flexible workloads along with handling concurrent users. It has been consistently supported by the global developer community. Due to its fault-tolerant nature, PostgreSQL has gained widespread popularity among developers."
"43. How do you define Indexes in PostgreSQL? Indexes are the inbuilt functions in PostgreSQL which are used by the queries to perform search more eﬀiciently on a table in the database. Consider that you have a table with thousands of records and you have the below query that only a few records can satisfy the condition, then it will take a lot of time to search and return those rows that abide by this condition as the engine has to perform the search operation on every single to check this condition. This is undoubtedly ineﬀicient for a system dealing with huge data. Now if this system had an index on the column where we are applying search, it can use an eﬀicient method for identifying matching rows by walking through only a few levels. This is called indexing. Select * from some_table where table_col=120"
44. How will you change the datatype of a column? This can be done by using the ALTER TABLE statement as shown below: Syntax: ALTER TABLE tname ALTER COLUMN col_name [SET DATA] TYPE new_data_type;
45. What is the command used for creating a database in PostgreSQL? SQL Interview Questions The first step of using PostgreSQL is to create a database. This is done by using the createdb command as shown below: createdb db_name A
"46. How can we start, restart and stop the PostgreSQL server? To start the PostgreSQL server, we run: service postgresql start Once the server is successfully started, we get the below message: Starting PostgreSQL: ok To restart the PostgreSQL server, we run: service postgresql restart Once the server is successfully restarted, we get the message: Restarting PostgreSQL: server stopped ok To stop the server, we run the command: service postgresql stop Once stopped successfully, we get the message: Stopping PostgreSQL: server stopped ok SQL Interview Questions"
"47. What are partitioned tables called in PostgreSQL? Partitioned tables are logical structures that are used for dividing large tables into smaller structures that are called partitions. This approach is used for eﬀectively increasing the query performance while dealing with large database tables. To create a partition, a key called partition key which is usually a table column or an expression, and a partitioning method needs to be defined. There are three types of inbuilt partitioning methods provided by Postgres: Range Partitioning: This method is done by partitioning based on a range of values. This method is most commonly used upon date fields to get monthly, weekly or yearly data. In the case of corner cases like value belonging to the end of the range, for example: if the range of partition 1 is 10-20 and the range of partition 2 is 20-30, and the given value is 10, then 10 belongs to the second partition and not the first. List Partitioning: This method is used to partition based on a list of known values. Most commonly used when we have a key with a categorical value. For example, getting sales data based on regions divided as countries, cities, or states. Hash Partitioning: This method utilizes a hash function upon the partition key. This is done when there are no specific requirements for data division and is used to access data individually. For example, you want to access data based on a specific product, then using hash partition would result in the dataset that we require. The type of partition key and the type of method used for partitioning determines how positive the performance and the level of manageability of the partitioned table are."
"48. Define tokens in PostgreSQL? A token in PostgreSQL is either a keyword, identifier, literal, constant, quotes identifier, or any symbol that has a distinctive personality. They may or may not be separated using a space, newline or a tab. If the tokens are keywords, they are usually commands with useful meanings. Tokens are known as building blocks of any PostgreSQL code. SQL Interview Questions"
"49. What is the importance of the TRUNCATE statement? TRUNCATE TABLE name_of_table statement removes the data eﬀiciently and quickly from the table. The truncate statement can also be used to reset values of the identity columns along with data cleanup as shown below: TRUNCATE TABLE name_of_table RESTART IDENTITY; We can also use the statement for removing data from multiple tables all at once by mentioning the table names separated by comma as shown below: TRUNCATE TABLE table_1, table_2, table_3;"
50. What is the capacity of a table in PostgreSQL? The maximum size of PostgreSQL is 32TB.
"51. Define sequence. A sequence is a schema-bound, user-defined object which aids to generate a sequence of integers. This is most commonly used to generate values to identity columns in a table. We can create a sequence by using the CREATE SEQUENCE statement as shown below: CREATE SEQUENCE serial_num START 100; To get the next number 101 from the sequence, we use the nextval() method as shown below: SELECT nextval('serial_num'); SQL Interview Questions We can also use this sequence while inserting new records using the INSERT command: INSERT INTO ib_table_name VALUES (nextval('serial_num'), 'interviewbit');"
"52. What are string constants in PostgreSQL? They are character sequences bound within single quotes. These are using during data insertion or updation to characters in the database. There are special string constants that are quoted in dollars. Syntax: $tag$<string_constant>$tag$ The tag in the constant is optional and when we are not specifying the tag, the constant is called a double-dollar string literal."
53. How can you get a list of all databases in PostgreSQL? This can be done by using the command \\l -> backslash followed by the lower- case letter L.
"54. How can you delete a database in PostgreSQL? This can be done by using the DROP DATABASE command as shown in the syntax below: DROP DATABASE database_name; If the database has been deleted successfully, then the following message would be shown: DROP DATABASE"
"55. What are ACID properties? Is PostgreSQL compliant with ACID? ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability. They are database transaction properties which are used for guaranteeing data validity in case of errors and failures. SQL Interview Questions Atomicity: This property ensures that the transaction is completed in all-or- nothing way. Consistency: This ensures that updates made to the database is valid and follows rules and restrictions. Isolation: This property ensures integrity of transaction that are visible to all other transactions. Durability: This property ensures that the committed transactions are stored permanently in the database. PostgreSQL is compliant with ACID properties."
"56. Can you explain the architecture of PostgreSQL? The architecture of PostgreSQL follows the client-server model. The server side comprises of background process manager, query processer, utilities and shared memory space which work together to build PostgreSQL’s instance that has access to the data. The client application does the task of connecting to this instance and requests data processing to the services. The client can either be GUI (Graphical User Interface) or a web application. The most commonly used client for PostgreSQL is pgAdmin. SQL Interview Questions"
"57. What do you understand by multi-version concurrency control? MVCC or Multi-version concurrency control is used for avoiding unnecessary database locks when 2 or more requests tries to access or modify the data at the same time. This ensures that the time lag for a user to log in to the database is avoided. The transactions are recorded when anyone tries to access the content. For more information regarding this, you can refer here."
"58. What do you understand by command enable-debug? The command enable-debug is used for enabling the compilation of all libraries and applications. When this is enabled, the system processes get hindered and generally also increases the size of the binary file. Hence, it is not recommended to switch this on in the production environment. This is most commonly used by developers to debug the bugs in their scripts and help them spot the issues. For more information regarding how to debug, you can refer here."
"59. How do you check the rows aﬀected as part of previous transactions? SQL standards state that the following three phenomena should be prevented whilst concurrent transactions. SQL standards define 4 levels of transaction isolations to deal with these phenomena. SQL Interview Questions Dirty reads: If a transaction reads data that is written due to concurrent uncommitted transaction, these reads are called dirty reads. Phantom reads: This occurs when two same queries when executed separately return diﬀerent rows. For example, if transaction A retrieves some set of rows matching search criteria. Assume another transaction B retrieves new rows in addition to the rows obtained earlier for the same search criteria. The results are diﬀerent. Non-repeatable reads: This occurs when a transaction tries to read the same row multiple times and gets diﬀerent values each time due to concurrency. This happens when another transaction updates that data and our current transaction fetches that updated data, resulting in diﬀerent values. To tackle these, there are 4 standard isolation levels defined by SQL standards. They are as follows: Read Uncommitted – The lowest level of the isolations. Here, the transactions are not isolated and can read data that are not committed by other transactions resulting in dirty reads. Read Committed – This level ensures that the data read is committed at any instant of read time. Hence, dirty reads are avoided here. This level makes use of read/write lock on the current rows which prevents read/write/update/delete of that row when the current transaction is being operated on. Repeatable Read – The most restrictive level of isolation. This holds read and write locks for all rows it operates on. Due to this, non-repeatable reads are avoided as other transactions cannot read, write, update or delete the rows. Serializable – The highest of all isolation levels. This guarantees that the execution is serializable where execution of any concurrent operations are guaranteed to be appeared as executing serially. The following table clearly explains which type of unwanted reads the levels avoid: SQL Interview Questions Isolation levels Dirty Reads Phantom Reads Non-repe Read Uncommitted Might occur Might occur Might occ Read Committed Won’t occur Might occur Might occ Repeatable ReadWon’t occur Might occur Won’t occ Serializable Won’t occur Won’t occur Won’t occ"
"60. What can you tell about WAL (Write Ahead Logging)? Write Ahead Logging is a feature that increases the database reliability by logging changes before any changes are done to the database. This ensures that we have enough information when a database crash occurs by helping to pinpoint to what point the work has been complete and gives a starting point from the point where it was discontinued. For more information, you can refer here."
"61. What is the main disadvantage of deleting data from an existing table using the DROP TABLE command? DROP TABLE command deletes complete data from the table along with removing the complete table structure too. In case our requirement entails just remove the data, then we would need to recreate the table to store data in it. In such cases, it is advised to use the TRUNCATE command."
"62. How do you perform case-insensitive searches using regular expressions in PostgreSQL? SQL Interview Questions To perform case insensitive matches using a regular expression, we can use POSIX (~*) expression from pattern matching operators. For example: 'interviewbit' ~* '.*INTervIewBit.*'"
63. How will you take backup of the database in PostgreSQL? We can achieve this by using the pg_dump tool for dumping all object contents in the database into a single file. The steps are as follows: Step 1: Navigate to the bin folder of the PostgreSQL installation path. C:\\>cd C:\\Program Files\\PostgreSQL\\10.0\\bin Step 2: Execute pg_dump program to take the dump of data to a .tar folder as shown below: pg_dump -U postgres -W -F t sample_data > C:\\Users\\admin\\pgbackup\\sample_data.tar The database dump will be stored in the sample_data.tar file on the location specified.
"64. Does PostgreSQL support full text search? Full-Text Search is the method of searching single or collection of documents stored on a computer in a full-text based database. This is mostly supported in advanced database systems like SOLR or ElasticSearch. However, the feature is present but is pretty basic in PostgreSQL."
65. What are parallel queries in PostgreSQL? Parallel Queries support is a feature provided in PostgreSQL for devising query plans capable of exploiting multiple CPU processors to execute the queries faster. SQL Interview Questions

"HashMap Interview Questions Dave 16 Robin 19 Selena 32 Mark 10 As you can observe there is no ordering of names because hashmaps do not follow any particular ordering for storing the elements. Some important properties of a Hashmap in Java to remember: Hashmaps are basically used for storing key-value pairs using a hashtable Hashmap stores only unique keys The is no particular ordering of elements in a HashMap Import java.util.HashMap in your program for using a HashMap Now in this article, we will be covering the most important and frequently asked Java HashMap Interview Questions and Answers to help you ace the interviews. We will cover diﬀerent varieties of questions that cater to both freshers as well as experienced programmers. HashMap Interview Questions for Freshers"
"1. Explain the internal working of a HashMap. HashMap Interview Questions A hashmap uses a hashtable but what many people don’t know is that it is internally created using two data structures namely an array and a linked list. Whenever you declare a hashmap what is going to happen internally is that it will create an array of buckets. The buckets are referred to as nodes or you can say a linked list. These nodes contain mainly: The key, Value Hashcode Address of the next node. Now, when you insert values in a key like this: map.put(""hashmap implementation in Java"",1); Then hashcode will be calculated by the put method. This hashcode will help us to store the key at a particular index. Also, hashcode will make the process of retrieving the values faster. hashcode=hash(“hashmap implementation in Java”); HashMap Interview Questions This hash code is further computed and will generate an index for storing the value. The value of our key will be stored at the index given by the hashcode in the form of a LinkedList. It’s important to note that Java 8 introduced BST in place of a linked list to make retrieval of the key-value pairs more eﬀicient."
2. What is the time complexity in terms of big o notation of pushing and retrieving an element from a hashmap? Time complexity is the measure of the number of CPU cycles utilized by a program to execute. Hashmap time complexity for pushing and retrieving the elements is the order of 1 i.e O(1) using put and get methods respectively.
"3. State the diﬀerences between a Hashmap and a Hashtable in Java. HashMap Vs HashTable HashMap Interview Questions Parameter HashMap HashTable Synchronization Hashmap and HashTable are very similar to each other except for the fact that a hashmap does not allow synchronizationUnlike a Hashmap, synchronization is permitted in a Hashtable Performance You won't face any performance issues in a hashmap.Synchronization in a hashtable might sound like a good idea that a particular element would be thread-safe if there’s concurrent access with multiple threads however, the problem with synchronizing every method that allows access to the underlying collection is that it creates performance issues. So you will have performance issues while using a hashtable HashMap Interview Questions"
"4. Can you store multiple keys with the same value in a hashmap? No, multiple keys with the same value can’t be stored in a hashmap. When you try to insert a new key that is already present in the hashmap then overriding will happen and the old key will be replaced with the new key and a new value."
"5. Specify diﬀerent methods of creating a hashmap in java along with implementation. Diﬀerent methods of creating a hashmap are: 1) Constructing a hashmap with default capacity Syntax: HashMap<String, Integer> InterviewBIt_map1 = new HashMap<String, Integer>(); 2) Constructing a hashmap with a defined capacity i.e 50 in our example Syntax: HashMap<String, Integer> InterviewBIt_map2 = new HashMap<String, Integer>(50); 3) Specifying lead factor along with the capacity Syntax: HashMap<String, Integer> InterviewBIt_map3= new HashMap<String, Integer>(50, 0.5f); 4) By copying another map into our map Syntax:"
"6. Specify whether hashmaps in Java are thread-safe or not? HashMap<String, Integer> InterviewBIt_map4 = new HashMap<String, Integer>( InterviewBIt HashMap Interview Questions The answer is ""NO"" i.e java.lang.HashMap does not support thread-safety. If several threads are altering the HashMap, for example, insertions or removals, then a HashMap should not be shared with other threads. If you want to implement thread-safety then you can either use a ConcurrentHashMap or by using the Collections.synchronizedMap() method. When data consistency is crucial, Collections.synchronizedMap() should be used, and ConcurrentHashMap should be used where the number of reads and write operations to be performed are less. Since Collections.synchronizedMap() needs every thread to attain a lock on the whole object to accomplish both read and write operations, this results in slow performance. With ConcurrentHashMap, threads can simultaneously modify sections while maintaining a lock on individual segments."
"7. Does hashmap allow you to store null values? Yes, We can store as many null values in a hashmap as we want but only one null key can be stored not more than that. Let’s see a program that depicts how we can store null values in a hashmap. import java.util.*; import java.io.*; public class interviewBit { public static void main(String[] args) { HashMap hmap=new HashMap(); hmap.put(1,""Program to store null value""); hmap.put(null,""InterviewBit""); System.out.println(hmap); } } OUTPUT: {null=InterviewBit, 1=Program to store null value}"
8. What is the order in which keys are stored in a hashmap? HashMap Interview Questions There is no particular order for storing keys in a hashmap. All the keys are stored in an unsorted order. For storing the elements in a particular order a Treemap can be used in Java but a hashmap does not guarantee the ordering of your elements.
"9. How can iteration be performed in a HashMap? Output: Key = hashmap coding interview questions, Value = AT INTERVEWBIT Key = hashmap programming interview questions, Value = AT INTERVEWBIT"
"10. How Does Java's Capacity And Size Of Hashmap Diﬀer? Sometimes it's confusing for students to understand the diﬀerence between capacity is size. So basically, HashMap's capacity indicates the number of entries it can hold, while its length indicates how many key-value pairs are presently in existence. import java.util.Map; import java.util.HashMap; public class example_____iteration { public static void main(String[] arg) { Map<String,String> INTERVIEW_BIT = new HashMap<String,String>(); INTERVIEW_BIT.put(""hashmap coding interview questions"", ""AT INTERVEWBIT""); INTERVIEW_BIT.put(""hashmap programming interview questions"", ""AT INTERVEWBIT""); for (Map.Entry<String,String> entry : INTERVIEW_BIT.entrySet()) System.out.println(""Key = "" + entry.getKey() + "", Value = "" + entry.getValue()); } } HashMap Interview Questions"
"11. Discuss the approach for calculating all the equal combinations formed by a pair of numbers in an array using a hashmap i.e The numbers must satisfy these two conditions: nums[i] == nums[j] and i < j Answer) You all must have studied combinations, so the concept of combinations states that every time we just have to select a pair from n numbers in an array that satisfies the given conditions and the formula for doing so is NCR which is equivalent to n*(n-1)/2. Now hashmap will be used for calculating the frequency of all the numbers in the array. While iterating the array we will store the frequency of every element in a hashmap. The final step would be to iterate over the map and apply the formula n*(n-1)/2, where n is the frequency of each element in the array."
12. What is collision in HashMap? A collision occurs when more than one key generates the same hashCode() value. An ineﬀicient hashCode() algorithm causes considerable collisions in a hashmap. An increased number of collisions can aﬀect the performance of a hashmap.
"13. Which property of a hashmap is used to find the intersection of two arrays? Since a hashmap stores only unique elements, this property of a hashmap can be used to find intersections i.e common elements of two arrays. The approach to this problem is: first we will create a hashmap and fill the elements of the first array in it. The next step is to iterate over the second array and check whether the element is present in the hashmap or not. In this way, we can find all common elements of two arrays in O(n) time complexity. HashMap Interview Questions HashMap Interview Questions for Experienced"
14. As we know that hashcodes are generated for each and every key but what happens when the same hashcode is generated for distinct keys? When the same hashcode is generated for distinct keys then a collision will occur as the bucket address of the two keys will be the same. We have discussed that internally hashmap uses a linked list therefore the linked list will store them all together.
15. Distinguish between a Hashmap and ConcurrentHashMap in Java along with the implementation of both. Hashmap vs ConcurrentHashMap:
1. ThreadSafe: One of the most significant diﬀerences between both is that a Cocurrenthashmap is synchronized internally and thread-safe which makes it suitable for a multithreaded environment whereas a hashmap is non- synchronized as well non-thread-safe which makes it unsuitable for a multithreaded environment.
"2. Null Keys And Null Values: As we all know, data is kept in the form of key and value pairs in a hashmap and we can store as many null values in a hashmap as we want but only 1 null key can be stored whereas in a concurrent hashmap null keys, as well as null values, are not permitted. Implementations Hashmap Implementation: HashMap Interview Questions import java.util.*; import java.io.*; public class interviewBit { public static void main(String[] args) { HashMap hmap=new HashMap(); hmap.put(91,""Hashmap Implementation""); hmap.put(92,""in ""); hmap.put(93,""Java""); hmap.put(null,""InterviewBit""); System.out.println(hmap); } } OUTPUT: java -cp /tmp/ZPv88JJ0D2 interviewBit {null=InterviewBit, 91=Hashmap Implementation, 92=in , 93=Java} ConcurrentHashMap implementation: For implementing ConcurrentHashmap we have to import the concurrent package. import java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap; public class interviewBit { public static void main(String[] args) { ConcurrentHashMap hmap=new ConcurrentHashMap(); hmap.put(91,""Hashmap Implementation""); hmap.put(92,""in ""); hmap.put(93,""Java""); hmap.put(null,""InterviewBit""); System.out.println(hmap); } } OUTPUT: HashMap Interview Questions As we can observe from the above outputs we can store the null value in the hashmap but it can’t be stored in a ConcurrentHashMap as it gives NullPinterException."
"16. What is the maximum number of entries you can store in HashMap? HashMap does not have a maximum number of entries because when the bucket is full, the keys will be added to a linked list, which can store forever until all the memory you have is consumed."
"17. Define LinkedHashMap in Java A linked HashMap is implemented in a similar way to a hashmap but contains a doubly LinkedList for querying through all the key-value pairs. LinkedHashMap stores the key-value pair in order, unlike a hashmap. You can retrieve the data in the same order as they were inserted in the map i.e the key which was inserted first can be taken out first. Implementation of LinkedHashMap for understanding how we can insert and retrieve key and value pairs easily: java -cp /tmp/ZPv88JJ0D2 interviewBit Exception in thread ""main"" java.lang.NullPointerException at java.base/java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap.putVal(ConcurrentHashMap.java:1011) at java.base/java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap.put(ConcurrentHashMap.java:1006) at interviewBit.main(interviewBit.java:12) HashMap Interview Questions import java.util.LinkedHashMap; public class InterviewBit { public static void main(String[] args) { LinkedHashMap m = new LinkedHashMap(); m.put(""Linked"", new Integer(1)); m.put(""Map"", new Integer(2)); Object lobj = m.get(""Linked""); System.out.println(lobj); } } The output of the above program will be 1."
"18. Which is the best technique to handle collision in a hashmap. As part of its collision handling, HashMap employs chaining. In chaining, a linked list is used for placing the key-value pairs inserted into the map with the value already present to avoid collision in the map at a bucket location as the newly inserted value is placed in front of the linked list."
"19. Distinguish between a hashmap and a Treemap. HashMap Interview Questions Hashmap Treemap In a hashmap, no ordering of elements is maintainedThe ordering, of elements, is maintained in a treemap. We can store as many null values in a hashmap as we want but only 1 null key can be stored We cannot store any null values or keys in a treemap. Hashmap is Fast since no ordering of elements is maintained therefore elements can be inserted and retrieved in constant time.Treemap is slow and most of the functions take logarithmic time. Hashmap uses arrays and LinkedList which forms a hashtable for its implementation internally.Treemap is implemented with the help of red-black trees."
"20. How can a hashmap be used to check whether two given arrays are equal or not i.e they contain the same elements or not? Given the arrays can be unsorted. HashMap Interview Questions A hashmap can be easily used to check whether the given arrays are equal or not. First, create a hashmap and using a for loop fill the frequency of each and every element of array 1 in the hashmap. Now, make another loop and decrement the frequency of each and every element of the second array in the hashmap. In the next step, iterate over the hashmap and check whether all the frequencies are zero or not. Even if any frequency is 1 return false else return true."
21. What factors determine the performance of a hashmap? The performance or eﬀiciency of a hashmap depends basically on two things that are: Capacity - Capacity is defined as the total number of buckets present in a Hashmap and Sixteen is the default capacity when a Hashmap is created by the user. The capacity can be increased when more key-value pairs are added to the hashmap. Load Factor - As discussed in the previous point the capacity of the map can be increased but when should the hashmap increase its capacity? This is decided by the load factor and its default value is seventy-five per cent. HashMap Coding Interview Questions
"22. You will be given an unsorted array of integers and a target t. How will you implement a program using a Hashmap to find the position of two numbers whose sum equals target t? Approach: HashMap Interview Questions A general approach for solving such kinds of problems is that first, you have to create a map of Integers. Then iterate through the given array and subtract the current value in the array from the given target. Look for that value in the hashmap simultaneously. If the value is found in the map then return the index of these 2 numbers else insert the current element of the array as the key and its index as the value in the Hashmap. Implementation: class InterviewBit{ public int[] target(int[] nums, int t) { HashMap<Integer, Integer> find_complement = new HashMap<>(); for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) { if (find_complement.containsKey(t - nums[i]) == true) { return new int[] { find_complement.get(t - nums[i]), i }; } find_complement.put(nums[i], i); } return null; } }"

"25. 4 sum using hashmap: You will be given four arrays arr1, arr2, arr3, and arr4 all of length n,you have to return the count of tuples (i, j, k, l) satisfying the conditions: 0 <= i, j, k, l < n nums1[i] + nums2[j] + nums3[k] + nums4[l] == 0 Approach: HashMap Interview Questions 2 nested loops will be required for implementing this. We will start by creating a hashmap Next, all possible sums of 2 elements will be calculated and stored in the map using the nested loops we created earlier. Now again the nested loop will be used for calculating the sum of 2 elements of the other two arrays. Once we find out all the combinations of the sum, we take the complement of that sum and find that in our hashmap. If the complement is found then the count of tuples will be increased by 1 every time The time complexity will be O(N2) Implementation: import java.util.*; class Solution { public int fourSumCount(int[] arr1, int[] arr2, int[] arr3, int[] arr4) { HashMap<Integer, Integer> AB = new HashMap<>(); for (int val1 : arr1) for (int val2 : arr2) AB.put(val1 + val2, AB.getOrDefault(val1 + val2, 0) + 1); int count = 0; for (int val3 : arr3) for (int val4 : arr4) count += AB.getOrDefault(-val3 - val4, 0); return count; } }"

"Artificial Intelligence Interview Questions Artificial Intelligence is the field of computer science concerned with building intelligent machines or computer systems, capable of simulating human intelligence. The machines created using Artificial Intelligence can work and react like humans without human intervention. Speech Recognition, Customer service, Recommendation Engine, Natural Language Processing (NLP) are some of the applications of Artificial Intelligence. Since its inception, AI research has explored and rejected a variety of methodologies, including mimicking the brain, modelling human problem-solving, formal logic, massive knowledge libraries, and imitating animal behavior. Highly mathematical- statistical machine learning dominated the subject in the first decades of the twenty- first century. The many sub-fields of AI research are based on specific aims and the application of certain techniques. Reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, sensing, and the ability to move and manipulate objects are all conventional AI research aims. One of the field's long-term goals is general intelligence (the capacity to solve any problem). AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of problem-solving strategies to handle these issues, including search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and statistics, probability, and economics methodologies. AI also makes use of various fields like psychology, linguistics, philosophy."

Artificial Intelligence is going to impact the world more than anything in the history of mankind."
6. What are the types of Artificial Intelligence? There are seven types of Artificial Intelligence. These are: Artificial Intelligence Interview Questions
1. Weak AI or Narrow AI- These are designed to perform dedicated tasks. They can not perform beyond their capabilities. Apple’s Siri and IBM’s Watson are some examples of weak AI or narrow AI.
"2. General AI- General AI can perform any intellectual task like humans. Currently, there is no system in the world that can be categorized under general AI. Researchers, however, are focused on developing AI devices that can perform tasks as perfectly as humans."
3. Super AI- Super AI is the level of Artificial Intelligence at which it can pass the intelligence of humans and can perform tasks better than humans. Super AI is still a hypothetical concept.
4. Reactive Machines- These kinds of machines react in the best possible way in a current situation. They do not store memories or experiences. IBM’s Deep Blue system and Google’s Alpha go are some examples of reactive machines.
"5. Limited memory- These machines store experiences, but only for a limited amount of time. For example, smart cars store the information of nearby cars, their speed, speed limit, route information for a limited amount of time."
"6. Theory of mind- The theory of machine AI is a theoretical concept. They might be able to understand human emotions, beliefs, society, and might be able to interact like humans."
"7. Self-awareness- Self-awareness AI is the future of AI. It is expected that these machines will be super-intelligent, having their own consciousness, emotions, and self-awareness."
"7. What is the diﬀerence between Artificial Intelligence, Machine learning, and Deep learning? Artificial Intelligence Interview Questions Artificial Intelligence Interview Questions Artificial Intelligence Machine Learning Deep Learning Artificial Intelligence is the ability of machines to function like the human brain.Machine learning is processing data, learning from it, and then making informed decisions.Deep learning uses Artificial Neural Networks to solve complex problems. The goal of AI is to allow machines to think for themselves without the need for human involvement.The purpose of machine learning is to allow a machine to learn from its previous experiences.Deep learning's purpose is to use numerous algorithms to tackle complicated problems in the same way that the human brain does. AI is capable of dealing with both structured and semi- structured data.Machine learning works with both organized and semi-structured data.Deep learning uses both structured and unstructured data to solve problems. AI is a subset of data science.Machine Learning is a subset of AI.Deep learning is a subset of Machine learning.

"9. What is Deep Learning? Deep learning is a subset of Machine learning, which makes use of artificial neural networks to solve complex problems. The artificial neural network is a concept inspired by information processing and distributed communication nodes, neurons, which are present in human brains. It gives deep learning the power to look at a problem and solve it like a human brain in that situation would. The word ‘deep’ in deep learning means the number of hidden layers in the neural network. Deep learning models are developed in such a way that they are capable of training and managing themselves. Artificial Intelligence Interview Questions In the above figure, the deep neural network takes input through an input layer. The algorithm's input and output are separated by a hidden layer, in which the function applies weights to the inputs and guides them through an activation function as the output. Activation functions of a Deep neural network may vary. For example, a Sigmoid Function can take any input and produce the output between 0 and 1. The output layer is the network's last layer that takes the information gleaned from the hidden layer and turns it into a final value. In a nutshell, the hidden layers conduct nonlinear changes on the network's inputs. The function of the neural network determines the hidden layers, and the layers themselves may vary depending on their associated weights."
"10. What are diﬀerent types of Machine Learning? Artificial Intelligence Interview Questions Artificial Intelligence Interview Questions Supervised Learning: Supervised learning is the easiest type of machine learning. It is used to train the machine with labeled data. Labeled data is a group of samples that have been tagged with one or more labels (information tags). The labeled data is fed to the machine one by one until the machine can recognize the data on its own. It is just like a teacher trying to teach a kid all kinds of labeled cards in a deck of cards one by one. The data itself is the teacher in supervised learning. Unsupervised Learning: Unsupervised learning is, interestingly, the opposite of supervised learning. It is used for data with without labels or information tags. The algorithm is fed with a lot of data and tools to understand the properties of data. The machine will organize the data in clusters, classes, or groups in such a way that it can make sense. Taking a huge amount of random data as an input and making sense out of it is what makes this learning model brilliant. Reinforcement learning: The reinforcement learning model from the above- mentioned learning models. It is a kind of model which learns from its mistakes. When we place a reinforcement learning model in any environment, it makes a lot of mistakes. We provide a positive feedback signal when the model performs well and a negative feedback signal when it makes errors, to promote positive learning and make our model eﬀicient."
"11. What are the misconceptions about Artificial Intelligence? Some misconceptions about Artificial Intelligence that exists are: Artificial Intelligence Interview Questions Machines learn from themselves- The reality is far from the statement. Machines are not yet at that stage where they can make a decision on their own. Machines learn through a process called machine learning that enables systems to learn and develop based on their experiences without having to be explicitly programmed. Machine learning is concerned with the creation of computer programs that can access data and learn on their own. Artificial Intelligence is the same thing as Machine learning- Artificial Intelligence and Machine learning diﬀer from each other. Artificial Intelligence concerns itself with creating devices that can mimic human intelligence, while machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence which is about creating programs that can analyze data, learn from it, and then make decisions. Artificial Intelligence will take over humans- There is a possibility that the capabilities of AI can match or even surpass human intelligence in the near future. But, saying that AI will take over humans is just a work of fiction. AI is supposed to complement human intelligence, not enslave it. Artificial Intelligence Interview Questions for Experienced"
"12. What is Q-learning? Q Learning is a model-free learning policy that chooses the best course of action in an environment, depending on where in the environment the agent is (an agent is an entity that makes a decision and enables AI to be put into action). Model-free learning policy means that the nature and predictions of the environment to learn and move forward. It does not reward a system to learn, it uses the trial and error method instead. Artificial Intelligence Interview Questions The model's goal is to determine the optimum course of action given the current situation. To accomplish this, it may devise its own set of rules or act outside of the policy that has been established for it to obey. This means there isn't a real need for a policy, which is why it's called oﬀ-policy. The agent's experience is saved in the Q table in Q-learning, and the value in the table indicates the long-term reward value of executing a certain action in a specific condition. The Q learning algorithm, according to the Q table, can instruct the Q agent the action to take in a given situation to maximize the predicted reward."
"13. What is the diﬀerence between a strong AI and a weak AI? Artificial Intelligence Interview Questions Strong AI Weak AI Strong AI is a theoretical form of AI with a view that machines can develop consciousness and cognitive abilities equal to humans.Weak AI, also called narrow AI, is AI with limited functionality. It refers to building machines with complex algorithms to accomplish complex problem-solving, but it does not show the entire range of human cognitive capabilities. Strong AI can perform a wide range of functions.In comparison to strong AI, weak AI has fewer functions. Weak AI is unable of achieving self-awareness or demonstrating the full spectrum of human cognitive capacities and operate within a pre-defined range of functions. Strong AI-powered machines have a mind of their own, and they can think and accomplish tasks on their own.Weak AI-powered machines do not have a mind of their own. No machine of strong AI exists in reality.Examples include Siri or Google Assistant. Artificial Intelligence Interview Questions"
"14. Which assessment is used to test the intelligence of a machine? Explain it. The Turing test is used to determine whether or not a machine is capable of thinking like a human. IT was developed by Alan Turing in 1950. The Turing Test is like an interrogation game between three players. There is an interrogator who is a human. He has to interrogate two other players- one computer and one human. The interrogator has to figure out which one is a computer by asking questions. The computer has to do its best to make itself hard to be distinguished from the human. The machine will be considered intelligent if it makes it hard to be distinguished from the human. Consider the following scenario: Player A is a computer, Player B is a human, and Player C is a questioner. The interrogator is aware that one of them is a robot, but he needs to figure out which one. Since all players communicate via keyboard and screen, the outcome is unaﬀected by the machine's capacity to transform words into speech. The exam result is determined not by the number of correct answers, but by how closely the responses resemble those of a human. The computer is permitted to do whatever it can to force the interrogator to make a false identification. The question-answer session can be like this- Interrogator: Are you a computer? Player A (computer)- No. Interrogator: Multiply two huge numbers, such as (256896489*456725896). Player A- A"
"15. What is Computer Vision in AI? Computer Vision in the field of AI enables computer systems to deduce meaningful interpretations from images or any other visual stimulation and take action based on that input. AI gives the system the ability to think, then computer vision gives the system the ability to observe. Computer vision is very much similar to human vision. Pattern recognition is the foundation of today's computer vision algorithms. We train computers on a vast amount of visual data—images are processed, things are labeled, and patterns are found in those items. For example, if we submit a million photographs of flowers to the computer, it will analyze them, find patterns that are common to all flowers, and produce a model ""flower"" at the end of the process. As a result, every time we submit them photographs, the computer will be able to precisely recognize whether a certain image is a flower.

"16. What are Bayesian networks? A Bayesian network is a probabilistic graphical model based on a set of variables and their dependencies, represented in the form of an acyclic graph. Bayesian networks are based on probability distribution, and they predict outcomes and detect anomalies using probability theory. The Bayesian networks are used to perform tasks such as prediction, detecting anomalies, reasoning, gaining insights, diagnostics, and decision-making. A Bayesian network, for example, could be used to illustrate the probability correlations between diseases and symptoms. The network may be used to calculate the chances of certain diseases being present based on symptoms."
"17. What is Reinforcement learning, and how does it work? Artificial Intelligence Interview Questions Reinforcement learning is an area of machine learning which works on reward-based models for prediction and decision making. It deploys a feedback-based mechanism to reward a machine when it makes good decisions. Negative feedback is provided to the machine when it does not perform well. This encourages the machine to find the best possible behavior in a particular situation. Unlike supervised learning, the agent learns autonomously utilizing feedback and no labelled data in Reinforcement Learning. Because there is no labeled data, the agent must rely only on its own experience to learn. RL is used to tackle a certain sort of problem in which sequential decision-making is required and the aim is long-term, such as game-playing, robotics, and so on. The agent interacts with and explores the world on its own. In reinforcement learning, an agent's primary goal is to increase performance by obtaining the most positive rewards. The agent learns through trial and error, and as a result of its experience, it improves its ability to complete the task. Reinforcement learning can be best understood by taking an example of a dog. When the owner of the dog wants to cultivate a good habit in his dog, he will train his dog to do that thing with the help of a treat. The dog will be rewarded with the treat if he obeys his owner. If he disobeys the owner, the owner will use a negative reinforcement technique by not giving his dog his favorite treat. This way, the dog will associate the habit with the treat. This is precisely how reinforcement learning works in a machine. Artificial Intelligence Interview Questions Applying Reinforcement learning Principles to dogs. Repeatedly awarding the dog with treats (positive reinforcement) can make the dog adapt to the good habits (walking in this case) quickly."
"18. How many types of agents are there in Artificial Intelligence? Simple Reflex Agents: Simple reflex agents ignore the history of the environment and its interaction with the environment and act entirely on the current situation. Model-Based Reflex Agents: These models perceive the world according to the predefined models. This model also keeps track of internal conditions, which can be adjusted according to the changes made in the environment. Goal-Based Agents: These kinds of agents react according to the goals given to them. Their ultimate aim is to reach that goal. If the agent is provided with multiple-choice, it will select the choice that will make it closer to the goal. Utility-based Agents: Sometimes, reaching the desired goal is not enough. You have to make the safest, easiest, and cheapest trip to the goal. Utility-based agents chose actions based on utilities (preferences set) of the choices. Learning Agents: These kinds of agents can learn from their experiences. Artificial Intelligence Interview Questions"
"19. Explain Markov’s decision process. Markov’s decision process (MDP) is a mathematical approach for reinforcement learning. Markov's decision process (MDP) is a mathematical framework used to solve problems where outcomes are partially random and partly controlled. To solve a complex problem using Markov’s decision process, the following basic things are needed- Agent- The agent is an entity that we are going to train. For example, a robot that is going to be trained to assist in cooking is an agent. Environment- The surroundings around the agent are called Environment. The kitchen is an environment in the case of the above-mentioned robot. State (S)- The current situation of the agent is called the state.

"20. What do you understand by reward maximization? Reward maximization is a technique used in Reinforcement learning. Reinforcement learning is a subset of AI algorithms made up of three main components: an environment, agents, and incentives. The agent alters its own and the environment's state by completing actions. The agent is awarded or penalized based on how much their activities aﬀect the goal the agent must attain. Many reinforcement learning challenges begin with the agent having no prior knowledge of the environment and conducting random behaviors. The agent learns to optimize its actions and adopt policies that maximize its reward based on the feedback it receives. The goal is to maximize the reward and the action of the agent by using optimal policies. This is called reward maximization. Any abilities that are repeatedly requested by the agent's environment must eventually be created in the agent's behavior if it can alter it to improve its cumulative reward. A good reinforcement learning agent could eventually learn perception, language, social intelligence, and other skills while maximizing its reward. Artificial Intelligence Interview Questions"
"21. Explain the Hidden Markov Model. The Hidden Markov model is a probabilistic model which is used to identify the probabilistic character of any event. It says that an observed event is related to a set of probability distributions. If a system is being modeled into a Markov’s chain, then the main goal of HMM is to identify the hidden layers of the Markov’s chain. Hidden means that the particular state is not observable to the observer. It is generally used for temporal data. HMM finds its application in reinforcement learning, temporal pattern recognition, etc. A Hidden Markov Model. Z₁…..Z"
"22. What is the diﬀerence between parametric and non- parametric models? Artificial Intelligence Interview Questions Parametric model Non-Parametric model Parametric models fix a number of parameters to build the model in machine learningThe Non-parametric models use a flexible number of parameters to build the model. Parametric analysis is to test group means.A non-parametric analysis is to test medians. It is applicable only for variables.It is applicable for both – Variable and Attribute. Parametric methods can be useful in a variety of scenarios, but they function best when the dispersion of each group is varied.Similarly, Non-Parametric Methods can perform well in a variety of conditions, but their performance is at its best (top) when each group's spread is equal. Parametric models hold strong assumptions about the data.It holds fewer assumptions about data. Examples: Naive Bayes model, logical regression, etc.Example: KNN."
"23. What do you understand by hyperparameters? Artificial Intelligence Interview Questions Hyperparameters are the parameters that control the entire training process. These variables are adjustable and have a direct impact on how successfully a model trains. They are declared beforehand. Model hyperparameters, which cannot be inferred while fitting the machine to the training set because they refer to the model selection task, and algorithm hyperparameters, which have no eﬀect on the model's performance but aﬀect the speed and quality of the learning process, are two types of hyperparameters. The selection of good hyperparameters is crucial for the training process. Activation function, alpha learning rate, hidden layers, number of epochs, number of branches in a decision tree, etc. are some of the examples of hyperparameters."
"24. What is Overfitting? Overfitting is a concept in data science when a data point does not fit against its training model. When the raining model is fed with data, there is a possibility that it might encounter some noise that cannot fit into the statistical model. This happens when the algorithm cannot perform accurately against unseen data. Overfitting data points- In the above linear model, some points do not fit in. These points are outliers. Artificial Intelligence Interview Questions"
"25. What are the techniques used to avoid overfitting? If we can detect overfitting at an early stage, it will be very useful for our training model. There are several methods up our sleeves that can be used to avoid overfitting- Cross-validation: Cross-validation is a resampling technique for evaluating machine learning models on a small sample of data. Remove features: We can remove the unnecessary features of the models to encompass the outliers. Early stopping: Early stopping is a type of regularization used in machine learning to minimize overfitting when using an iterative method like gradient descent to train a learner. Early stopping criteria specify how many iterations can be completed before the learner becomes over-fit. Training with more data: We can train our model with more data to accommodate outliers. Regularization: In machine learning, regularization is a method to solve the over-fitting problem by adding a penalty term with the cost function. Ensembling: Ensemble learning refers to combining the predictions from two or more models."
"26. What is Natural Language Processing? Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of Artificial Intelligence, concerned with giving computers the ability to understand and interact in human languages in a way humans can. NLP combines rule-based modeling of human language with statistical, machine learning, and deep learning models. This makes a computer fully understand and comprehend human language in the form of voice or text. Voice-operated GPS systems, speech-to-text systems, customer service chat boxes, etc. use NLP. Artificial Intelligence Interview Questions Natural language processing encompasses a wide range of methods for analyzing human language, including statistical and machine learning techniques, as well as rules-based and algorithmic approaches. Because text- and voice-based data, as well as practical applications, require a diverse set of methodologies. Tokenization and parsing, lemmatization/stemming, part-of-speech tagging, language detection, and semantic link identification are all basic NLP activities. You've probably done these chores manually previously if you ever diagrammed sentences in elementary school. NLP tasks, in general, break down language into smaller, more basic bits and attempt to comprehend the relationships between them. These tasks are used in higher NLP capabilities like- content categorization, topic discovery and modelling, sentiment analysis, speech-to-text, and text-to-speech conversion."

Artificial Intelligence Interview Questions Artificial Neural networks, simply called Neural networks, are computer systems based on units called nodes or artificial neurons, which resemble the neurons in human brains. Each node can transmit a signal from one node to another. An Artificial Neural Network A neural network includes several layers, each of which performs a specialized job. As the model's complexity grows, the number of layers grows as well, which is why it's called a multi-layer perceptron. A neural network in its purest form includes three layers: an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer. The input layer receives the input signals and passes them on to the next layer, with the output layer delivering the final prediction. These neural networks, like machine learning methods, must be taught with some training data before being used to solve a specific problem. Let's learn more about the perceptron now. An ANN consists of multiple layers including an input layer, an output layer, and hidden layers.

"33. What is a rational agent, and what is rationality? A rational agent is a person or entity, based on realistic models, that has preferences for advantageous outcomes and will try to achieve them in all scenarios. A rational agent is one who has defined preferences, models uncertainty and acts in such a way that its performance measure is maximized using all available actions. The proper things are stated to be done by a reasonable agent. AI is concerned with the development of rational agents for application in game theory and decision theory in a variety of real-world contexts. The rational action is the most crucial for an AI agent because, in an AI reinforcement learning algorithm, an agent receives a positive reward for each best feasible action and a negative reward for each incorrect action. Rationality is the ability to remain reasonable and just in all possible scenarios. The performance metric of an agent is used to determine its rationality. The following criteria can be used to assess rationality: The success criterion is defined by a performance metric. The agent has prior knowledge of its surroundings. The most eﬀective activities that an agent can take. The order in which precepts appear."

"36. Suppose you know a farmer. He tells you that despite working hard in the fields, his crop yield is deteriorating. How can AI help him? Artificial Intelligence Interview Questions AI can assist Farmers in the following ways: Artificial Intelligence in Farming Artificial Intelligence Interview Questions Using AI for intelligent spraying of chemicals- Every day, farms generate hundreds of data points about temperature, soil, water use, weather, and other factors. This data is used in real-time with the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning models to derive important insights such as when to sow seeds, which crops to plant, which hybrid seeds to plant for higher yields, and so on. Precision agriculture is a term used to describe how AI systems are helping to enhance overall harvest quality and accuracy. AI technology aids in the detection of plant disease, pests, and poor agricultural nutrition. AI sensors can detect and target weeds, then determine the best herbicide to use in the area. These sophisticated AI sprayers can substantially reduce the amount of pesticides needed in the fields, improving the quality of agricultural output while also reducing costs. Using AI-based robots for farm harvesting- Many businesses are attempting to increase agricultural eﬀiciency. Autonomous strawberry-picking machine1 and a vacuum system that can harvest mature apples from trees are examples of products. Sensor fusion, machine vision, and artificial intelligence models are used by these devices to locate harvestable produce and assist in picking the proper crops. Predicting the best time to sow- The diﬀerence between a successful harvest and a failing one is just timely information on a single data point: seed sowing timing. To tackle this, AI can use a predictive analytics technique to determine the best time to sow the seeds for optimal yield. In addition to a 7-day weather forecast, it provides information on soil health and fertilizer recommendations. Crop yield prediction and price forecast- The major concern for many farmers is the unpredictability of crop prices. Farmers are never able to design a fixed production schedule due to fluctuating pricing. This issue is particularly widespread in crops with short shelf lives, such as tomatoes. Companies are assessing land and monitoring crop health in real-time using satellite imagery and weather data. Companies can detect pest and disease infestations, estimate tomato output and yield, and forecast prices using technologies like big data, AI, and machine learning. They can guide the farmers and governments on the future price patterns, demand level, type of crop to sow for maximum benefit, pesticide usage, etc. Artificial Intelligence Interview Questions"
"37. “Customers who bought this also bought this”, you might have seen this when shopping on Amazon. How do you think this works? E-commerce giant Amazon uses a concept called collaborative filtering to achieve this. Collaborative filtering is a process of comparing the users with similar shopping behavior in order to suggest products to other users with similar shopping behavior. The engine makes predictions of what might interest a user based on the preferences of other users, and all it has is data. The data it contains include users browsing history, recently ordered products, wishlisted products, etc. For example, a sales record shows that a certain number of people who buy a phone also buy tempered glass along with them. So if next time a user buys a smartphone, he will receive a recommendation to buy a tempered glass as well."
"38. What is a Chatbot? How can they help to deliver the best customer support to the customers? Artificial Intelligence Interview Questions A chatbot is a computer program that simulates and processes human conversations. They can interact with us just like any other real person.

It is installed in the Global Assembly Cache(GAC)."
11. What is a garbage collector? .NET Interview Questions Garbage collector frees the unused code objects in the memory. The memory heap is partitioned into 3 generations: Generation 0: It holds short-lived objects. Generation 1: It stores medium-lived objects. Generation 2: This is for long-lived objects. Collection of garbage refers to checking for objects in the generations of the managed heap that are no longer being used by the application. It also performs the necessary operations to reclaim their memory. The garbage collector must perform a collection in order to free some memory space. During the garbage collection process: The list of live objects is recognized. References are updated for the compacted objects. The memory space occupied by dead objects is recollected. The remaining objects are moved to an older segment. System.GC.Collect() method is used to perform garbage collection in .NET.
12. What is caching? Caching means storing the data temporarily in the memory so that the data can be easily accessed from the memory by an application instead of searching for it in the original location.

"Probability Interview Questions Since the outcome of throwing the second die wouldn’t be aﬀected by the outcome of throwing the first dice, we can calculate the probability of independent events A and B both occurring as: P(A ∩ B)=P(A) ∗ P(B) The probability of getting at least one 5 can be computed using the probability of the union of two events: P(A ∪ B)=P(A)+P(B)−P(A ∩ B)The probability of getting any specific outcome from a die is ⅙. Thus, P(A ∪ B)=1/6+1/6−1/(6*6)=1/3-1/36=11/36 Thus the probability of rolling at least one five with two dice is 11/36."
"2. Given that a die is rolled twice and the sum of the numbers is noted to be 6, what is the conditional probability that the number 4 has occurred at least once? If you roll the dice twice, you'll get the following sample space: S = { (1,1)(1,2)(1,3)(1,4)(1,5)(1,6) (2,1)(2,2)(2,3)(2,4)(2,5)(2,6) (3,1)(3,2)(3,3)(3,4)(3,5)(3,6) (4,1)(4,2)(4,3)(4,4)(4,5)(4,6) (5,1)(5,2)(5,3)(5,4)(5,5)(5,6) (6,1)(6,2)(6,3)(6,4)(6,5)(6,6)} Provided the given data, calculate the probability that 4 has appeared at least once, given that the sum of the numbers is 6. Assume that F: The total of two numbers is six. Take E, for example, 4 has appeared at least once. As a result, we must locate P(E|F). Obtaining P (E): The chances of collecting four at least once are: Probability Interview Questions E = (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6) As a result, P(E) = 11/36. Identifying P (F): The chance of getting the sum of two numbers is 6: F = {(1, 5), (5, 1), (2, 4), (4, 2), (3, 3)} As a result, P(F) = 5/ 36 In addition, E ∩ F = {(2,4), (4,2)} P(E ∩ F) = 2/36 As a result, P(E|F) = (P(E ∩ F) ) / (P (F) ) Now, Substitute the computed probability values= (2/36)/ (5/36) Hence, 2/5 is the required probability."
"3. Team A and B are competing in a game in which they must win four of the seven rounds to win. What is the likelihood that they will play all seven rounds if A's chance of winning is p and B's chance of winning is 1-p (no chance of a tie)? What if the chances of A winning diﬀer on the home field (p) and the away field (q)? If two teams compete in all seven rounds, both A and B must win three times in the first six rounds, regardless of who wins the final round. Each round can be thought of as a Bernoulli trial, with the number of times A wins in the first six games following a binomial distribution. The probability of A winning is Bi(n,k,p), with n=6, k=3, and p=p. The probability of A winning three times out of six games, according to the Binomial distribution, is: Probability Interview Questions Because team A has won three times, team B has won three times as well. We can suppose that Team A's chance of winning at home is p, away is q, and Team A has won x games at home if the two teams have diﬀerent winning percentages at home and away. x, p, and q will determine the likelihood of both teams playing all seven rounds. We know that both teams A and B must win three rounds and that Team A must win x games at home and 3-x games away, while Team B must win 3-x games away (Team A's home being Team B's visit site, and Team B wins aways when A loses at home) and win x rounds at home. Playing seven rounds has a probability of:"
"4. What is the likelihood of drawing two cards with the same suite (from the same deck)? This is an illustration of a dependent event. According to this definition, the likelihood that two events will occur in the case of a dependent event is: The probability of events A and B occurring simultaneously is equal to the chance of events A occurring multiplied by the likelihood of events B occurring given the outcome of events A. Probability Interview Questions This is expressed as P(A ∩B)=P(A) ∗P(B ∣A) In this scenario, a deck of cards comprises four suites, each of which contains 13 cards. Our chance of getting a card from a certain suite in the initial draw would be 13/52. Our chances of drawing a card from the same suite as the previous one in the subsequent draw would drop from 13/52 to 12/51. Hence P(two cards same suite) =4 ∗ 13/52 * 12/51 =4/17"
"5. We choose two cards at random from a deck of cards with numbers ranging from 1 to 100. What is the likelihood that a number on one card is precisely twice the number on the other? With the idea of a combination, this query can also be resolved. This is due to the fact that the order is unimportant when we draw two cards from the same deck of cards. As a result, receiving a card with the number 10 in the first draw and the number 40 in the second draw is equivalent to receiving a card with the number 40 in the first draw and the number 10 in the second. Input values from the question into the combination equation will provide the following results: C(100,2) =100!/(100-2)!2! = 4950 combinations Hence there are 4950 combination pairings available. Given that we have 100 cards altogether, there are 50 ways out of those 4950 combinations where one card is double another. As a result, we may determine the probability as: 50/4950 = 0.01 = 1% Probability Interview Questions"
"6. What is the probability of rolling the dice seven times and receiving a 5? Simply entering values into the binomial distribution equation will provide the solution to this query. Assuming that there have been 1 success and 7 trials, we can say that there have been 1 success and 7 trials. As we all know, there is a 1 in 6 chance of getting a 5 on a single throw. The probability mass function (PMF) of the binomial distribution is as follows: Hence by putting values we get,"

Probability Interview Questions Diﬀerent from the previous question, now we need to compute the expected value of a variable with binomial distribution instead of computing the PMF. We can answer this question by plugging the values into the equation of the expected value of the binomial distribution. From the equation above, we have N coupons and the probability of using a coupon is P. Thus, the expected value would be: E(X)=N*P And the anticipated expense would be: E(X) ∗5$=N ∗P ∗5"
"8. What is the variance's definition? The variance measures the range of data points in a dataset in relation to its mean value, as the notion suggests. The general formula for a variance is given below: Where n is the total number of samples, x is the sample, x bar is the sample mean, and S is the variance."
"9. What is a p-value? If you had a diﬀerent (far larger, 3 mil records, for example) data set, would it aﬀect how you interpret the p-value? Probability Interview Questions In the world of statistics, the term ""p-Value"" refers to the probability value, which is typically applied during hypothesis testing. When your null hypothesis is true, the facts you just observed are considered to be very unlikely, according to the p-value. Typically, a significance level is established before hypothesis testing. We reject the null hypothesis if the p-value is less than the threshold we consider significant. In the meantime, if the p-Value exceeds the level of significance, we proceed with our null hypothesis. The meaning of the p-Value is unaﬀected by the size of your dataset, although a larger dataset yields a more solid and trustworthy conclusion from our p-Value."

Find the smallest sample size N that will allow our sample estimate of P to be, with a 95% confidence level, within a DELTA of the actual click-through rate P. The understanding of confidence intervals, the margin of error, sample size, and binomial distribution is tested by this question. The conversion rate in the hypothetical situation has a binomial distribution, so we must calculate the standard deviation using the square root of the variance of the binomial distribution. The following is the general equation for the binomial distribution's variance: Var(X)=p(1-p) Our understanding of the question's 95 per cent confidence interval results in a Z- score of 1.96.

In terms of statistics, there wouldn't be any discernible disparities between the variable samples in each bucket if the buckets were actually chosen at random. However, how can we tell if the sample diﬀerences between the buckets are meaningful or not? To assess this, we can perform a statistical test. The two-sample t-test can be used if the variables we observe are continuous variables and there is only one treatment. In the meanwhile, we can utilize ANOVA if there are numerous treatments.

"13. What distinguishes probability density functions from probability mass functions? Probability mass function:- The probability distribution for discrete variables is provided by the Probability Mass Function (PMF). For instance, throwing dice. The complete sample space is defined by 6 unique outcomes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. We only have whole numbers; there are no fractions like 1.2 or 3.75. Each discrete variable's probability is mapped to the PMF. Each of the six factors has a 1/6 chance of being rolled in an ideal environment when rolling a die. Probability density function:-The probability distribution of the continuous random variables is provided by the Probability Density Function. we use a probability distribution function where outcome values are not fixed like we have a range of values as outcomes for example if we try to calculate the height of students in a class we get the value in range. The probability density function is calculated by the area under the curve of the interval in which or outcome values lie."
"14. What is a Probability Distribution? A probability distribution is a statistical function that outlines every conceivable value and likelihood that a random variable could have within a specified range. Two main categories of probability distribution exist: Discrete probability distributions: used random variables having discrete outcomes, such as the frequency of heads in five consecutive coin tosses, the number of rainy days in a particular week, the number of goals a player scores, etc., Continuous probability distributions: used for random variables with continuous outcomes, such as the average height of male students, the median price of a home in San Francisco, the number of claims a given insurance provider receives, and so forth."
"15. How would you use Bayes' Rule to test hypotheses? Probability Interview Questions We can calculate a conditional probability using new information we already have using the Bayes' Rule equation. In the case of two distinct events A and B, we can consider the following two events in terms of Baye's theorem: Hypothesis A, which may be true or untrue Evidence A supporting B, which may be present or not. As a result, A is the occurrence whose likelihood we are interested in. The issue can be stated as follows using Bayes' theorem: Where: The probability that event A will occur if event B is true is expressed as P(A|B). We are attempting to estimate what is also known as the posterior. P(B|A) is the likelihood that event B will occur assuming that event A is true. It can alternatively be understood as the probability of witnessing the new data given our prior hypothesis, and it can also be understood as the likelihood. The probabilities of seeing A and B, P(A), and P(B), respectively, in the absence of any specific conditions, are also known as the prior and marginal probabilities. Now, in order to compare the two hypotheses, we compute their respective probabilities using the previous technique. Acceptance is given to the hypothesis with the highest posterior probability.

"1. Every 25 stories, there will be one advertisement."
"2. There is a 4% possibility that every story contains an advertisement. How many advertisements should be expected to appear in 100 news stories for each option? What is the likelihood that a user will only see one ad out of every 100 stories if we choose option 2? The expected value and binomial distribution PMF are both tested in this question. The first query, which concerns the anticipated number of advertisements displayed in 100 news pieces, is: E(ads shown) =100*4/100=4 The PMF of a binomial distribution can be used to provide an answer to the second query, where there are 100 total trials, one success (a single ad), and a 0.04 probability that each story would contain an advertisement."

You will be tested on your understanding of the Bayes theorem and the binomial distribution in this question. The probability that exactly one cyclist will use the coupon can be calculated using the binomial PMF: The PMF of a binomial distribution can also be used to calculate the likelihood that both of them will use the coupon. Probability Interview Questions As per normal, the next step is to describe an event so that we may better grasp what each item in the Bayes' theorem equation means, A= At least one rider has used the coupon.

What is the probability of you tossing an unfair coin? Here, the Bayes Theorem can be used. Let U stand for the scenario in which we flip an unfair coin and F for the scenario in which we flip a fair coin. We are aware that P(U) = P(F) = 0.5 since the coin is picked at random.

1. More heads are on A than B.
2. Equal numbers of heads are present in A and B.
"3. A is headless compared to B. Keep in mind that A will always win in scenario 1 (regardless of coin n+1), while A will always lose in scenario 3 (regardless of coin n+1). These two scenarios have an equal chance of happening because of symmetry. Put x for any scenario's probability and y for scenario 2's probability. Since there are only 3 events that can occur, we know that 2x + y = 1. Let's now think about coin n+1. A will have prevailed if the coin lands face up with a probability of 0.5 under scenario 2. (which happens with probability y). As a result, A's overall odds of winning the game increase by 0.5y. So, the likelihood that player A will prevail in the game is: x+1/2y =x+!/2(1-2x) =1/2"
"21. A and B are participating in a game of archery together. Assume that both of their arrow-firing skills are identical and that both have a 0.5 chance of hitting the target. Probability Interview Questions What is the probability that A will hit more targets than B given that A has fired 201 arrows and B has fired 200? Since 201 is not an even number, let's start with 200 games. Assume that in 200 games, event A is A shooting more arrows on target than event B, event B is B shooting more arrows on target, and event C is they both shoot the same number of arrows on targets. We possess Given that A and B compete evenly in 200 games of archery, we obtain P(A) = P. (B). Thus: Now switch to the additional game that player A plays. if over the previous 200 games: If A is higher than B, then A remains higher than B whether A hits the target in this additional game or not. If A is less than B, then A will still not be more than B even if A fires on target for the additional game. If A=B and A hits the target in the additional game, then A will be higher than B and there is a 0.5 chance that A will hit the target in any game. As a result, the overall likelihood that A surpasses B is: Since 2P(A) + P(C) = 1, we can divide 2 into both sides to get the following result: P(A)+P(C)=0.5 When A plays 201 games and B plays 200 games, there is a 0.5 per cent chance that A will score more targets than B."
"22. You have 40 cards total, with 10 each of red, green, blue, and yellow. There is a number from 1 to 10 for each color. What is the likelihood that two cards you draw without a replacement will not be the same color or have the same number? Probability Interview Questions The odds of receiving two cards with the same number and two cards of the same color can be calculated first, and the result is one less than the total of the two probabilities. The likelihood of drawing two identical cards is as follows: P(Same Number) = 40/40* (9/39) = 9/39 Any number can be drawn in the first draw, regardless of significance. As a result, the likelihood is unaﬀected by the first draw; but, because there are only 39 cards available, you must choose the same number for the second draw. There are four cards with the same number on them, each in a diﬀerent color. You can only choose three cards from a total of 39 for the second draw. The same reasoning applies if you get two cards of the same color: P(Same colour) = 40/40*(9/39) = 9/39 In the initial draw, we can choose any color, but we can only select nine cards from the remaining 39 of the same hue. The likelihood of not receiving the same card AND the same number is: P = 1-P(Same Number)-P(Same colour) = 27/39"
"23. Eight people enter an elevator in a building with ten floors. What is the expected number of stopping? What assumptions do you need to calculate this expectation? We can use the binomial distribution to answer this question if we model each passenger's decision to halt on a particular floor as a Bernoulli trial. The presumptions comprise: 8 passengers make autonomous choices; assume that all occupants enter on the first floor and that there are ten options ranging from one to ten floors. (There are only 9 options if you assume no one stops at the first floor.) Probability Interview Questions There are eight passengers in all, and the elevator will stop if anyone wishes to exit for any reason. Instead of figuring out how likely it is that the elevator will stop at a specific floor, we may figure out how likely it is that it won't stop. The likelihood that the elevator won't stop at any floor, for any floor, is: (9/10)^8 The likelihood that the elevator will stop at any floor is 1-(9/10)^8 Assume that X is a random variable with the elevator's stopping frequency and that X has a binomial distribution to get the predicted number of stops in this situation $X ~ Bi(10,(1-(9/10)^8))$ If n=10, then p=1-(9/10)^8 The binomial distributed random variable's expected value is np: E(x)=10*1-(9/10)^8"

What are the odds that you are really ill? (We are grateful to Dennis Meisner for spotting the misinterpretation here.) Assume that event A has the illness and that event B tested positive. According to the details in the query: P(B|A) = 99.9 percent, and 1 percent of those who tested positive don't have the condition, therefore P(B|not A) = 1 percent; if P(A) = 0.1 percent, then P(not A) equals 99.9 per cent P(A|B) is what? Bayes' Theorem: P (A|B) = [ P(B|A) P(A)] / P(B) Probability Interview Questions And, P(B) = P(B|A) * P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B | notA) * P (notA) Plug in every number: P(A|B) = (0.99*0.001)/(0.99*0.001+0.01*0.999) = 9% All of the questions have answers in the list below.

"25. In order to win the game, Team A and Team B must win 4 of the game's 7 rounds. What is the likelihood that they will play all seven rounds if the probability of A winning is p, the probability of B winning is 1-p, and there is no chance of a tie? What if the odds that team A wins diﬀer on the home field (p) and the visiting field (q)? If two teams compete in all 7 rounds, both A and B must win exactly 3 times in the first 6 rounds; the last round's winner is irrelevant. If we think of each round as a Bernoulli trial, then the distribution of how many times A wins in the first 6 games is binomial. Bi(n,k,p) with n=6, k=3, and p=p gives the likelihood that A will prevail. The likelihood that player A will win 3 out of every 6 games is, according to the binomial distribution: Keep in mind that when team A wins three times, team B automatically wins three times Probability Interview Questions We can assume Team A's likelihood of winning at home is p, Team A's probability of winning away is q, and Team A has won x games at home if the two teams have diﬀerent winning percentages playing at home and playing away. The likelihood that both teams will participate in all 7 rounds will depend on the variables x, p, and q. We know that team A and team B must each win 3 rounds in order to advance, and that team A must win x games at home and 3-x games away, while team B must win 3-x games away (team B visits team A's home, therefore team B wins away games when A loses at home) and win x rounds at home. The likelihood of seven rounds being played is We can learn more about the likelihood if we have additional information about the distribution of x."
"26. On each corner of an equilateral triangle, three zebras are seated. Each zebra chooses a direction at random and proceeds solely around the triangle's perimeter to either of its opposite edges. What is the likelihood that no zebras will collide? Consider the zebras as being arranged in an equilateral triangle. If they are going down the outline to each edge, they each have two possible ways to travel in. Let's calculate the likelihood that they won't collide given that the scenario is random. Actually, there are just two options. Either all of the zebras will opt to move in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction as they run. Probability Interview Questions Let's determine the likelihood of each. The likelihood that each zebra will choose to move in a clockwise direction will be determined by the sum of their individual decisions. Given that there are two options (clockwise or counterclockwise), the answer is 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2, which equals 1/8. The likelihood of each zebra turning counterclockwise is 1/8. As a result, when the probabilities are added together, we obtain the proper probability of 1/4, or 25%."

Each of your buddies has a 2/3 chance of being honest with you and a 1/3 chance of playing a practical joke on you by lying. It is raining, as all three of your buddies confirm. What is the probability that Seattle is experiencing rain right now? You must assume something about the likelihood of rain in Seattle in order to respond to this question. Say the value is 0.5. Since each of our pals has a 2/3 chance of being honest, there is a 2/3 chance that Seattle will experience rain if our friends are correct. Given that our friends predict that it won't rain in Seattle, the likelihood of it not raining is also 23. Let's define an event as follows in light of this: A= a rainy day in Seattle. A’ = not raining in Seattle Xi = random variable with a Bernoulli distribution, and its value corresponds to the response provided by our friends: raining (1) or not (0) By using Bayes' theorem, we can therefore approximatively determine the likelihood that it will rain in Seattle provided that our friends predict that it will.

The mongos acts as a query router, providing an interface between client applications and the sharded cluster. Config servers store metadata and configuration settings for the cluster. MongoDB uses the config servers to manage distributed locks. Each sharded cluster must have its own config servers."
"7. What are some features of MongoDB? MongoDB Interview Questions Indexing: It supports generic secondary indexes and provides unique, compound, geospatial, and full-text indexing capabilities as well. Aggregation: It provides an aggregation framework based on the concept of data processing pipelines. Special collection and index types: It supports time-to-live (TTL) collections for data that should expire at a certain time File storage: It supports an easy-to-use protocol for storing large files and file metadata. Sharding: Sharding is the process of splitting data up across machines."
"8. How to add data in MongoDB? The basic method for adding data to MongoDB is “inserts”. To insert a single document, use the collection’s insertOne method: > db.books.insertOne({""title"" : ""Start With Why""}) For inserting multiple documents into a collection, we use insertMany. This method enables passing an array of documents to the database."
"9. How do you Update a Document? Once a document is stored in the database, it can be changed using one of several update methods: updateOne, updateMany, and replaceOne. updateOne and updateMany each takes a filter document as their first parameter and a modifier document, which describes changes to make, as the second parameter. replaceOne also takes a filter as the first parameter, but as the second parameter replaceOne expects a document with which it will replace the document matching the filter. For example, in order to replace a document: { ""_id"" : ObjectId(""4b2b9f67a1f631733d917a7a""), ""name"" : ""alice"", ""friends"" : 24, ""enemies"" : 2 } MongoDB Interview Questions"
"10. How do you Delete a Document? The CRUD API in MongoDB provides deleteOne and deleteMany for this purpose. Both of these methods take a filter document as their first parameter. The filter specifies a set of criteria to match against in removing documents. For example: > db.books.deleteOne({""_id"" : 3})"
"11. How to perform queries in MongoDB? The find method is used to perform queries in MongoDB. Querying returns a subset of documents in a collection, from no documents at all to the entire collection. Which documents get returned is determined by the first argument to find, which is a document specifying the query criteria. Example: > db.users.find({""age"" : 24})"
"12. What are the data types in MongoDB? MongoDB supports a wide range of data types as values in documents. Documents in MongoDB are similar to objects in JavaScript. Along with JSON’s essential key/value– pair nature, MongoDB adds support for a number of additional data types. The common data types in MongoDB are: MongoDB Interview Questions Null {""x"" : null} Boolean {""x"" : true} Number {""x"" : 4} String {""x"" : ""foobar""} Date {""x"" : new Date()} Regular expression {""x"" : /foobar/i} Array {""x"" : [""a"", ""b"", ""c""]} Embedded document {""x"" : {""foo"" : ""bar""}} Object ID {""x"" : ObjectId()} Binary Data Binary data is a string of arbitrary bytes. Code {""x"" : function() { /* ... */ }}"
"13. When to use MongoDB? You should use MongoDB when you are building internet and business applications that need to evolve quickly and scale elegantly. MongoDB is popular with developers of all kinds who are building scalable applications using agile methodologies. MongoDB is a great choice if one needs to: MongoDB Interview Questions Support a rapid iterative development. Scale to high levels of read and write traﬀic - MongoDB supports horizontal scaling through Sharding, distributing data across several machines, and facilitating high throughput operations with large sets of data. Scale your data repository to a massive size. Evolve the type of deployment as the business changes. Store, manage and search data with text, geospatial, or time-series dimensions. MongoDB Intermediate Interview Questions"
"14. How is Querying done in MongoDB? The find method is used to perform queries in MongoDB. Querying returns a subset of documents in a collection, from no documents at all to the entire collection. Which documents get returned is determined by the first argument to find, which is a document specifying the query criteria. For example: If we have a string we want to match, such as a ""username"" key with the value ""alice"", we use that key/value pair instead: > db.users.find({""username"" : ""alice""})"
"15. Explain the term “Indexing” in MongoDB. In MongoDB, indexes help in eﬀiciently resolving queries. What an Index does is that it stores a small part of the data set in a form that is easy to traverse. The index stores the value of the specific field or set of fields, ordered by the value of the field as specified in the index. MongoDB’s indexes work almost identically to typical relational database indexes. Indexes look at an ordered list with references to the content. These in turn allow MongoDB to query orders of magnitude faster. To create an index, use the createIndex collection method. For example: > db.users.find({""username"": ""user101""}).explain(""executionStats"") MongoDB Interview Questions Here, executionStats mode helps us understand the eﬀect of using an index to satisfy queries."
"16. What are Geospatial Indexes in MongoDB? MongoDB has two types of geospatial indexes: 2dsphere and 2d. 2dsphere indexes work with spherical geometries that model the surface of the earth based on the WGS84 datum. This datum model the surface of the earth as an oblate spheroid, meaning that there is some flattening at the poles. Distance calculations using 2sphere indexes, therefore, take the shape of the earth into account and provide a more accurate treatment of distance between, for example, two cities, than do 2d indexes. Use 2d indexes for points stored on a two-dimensional plane. 2dsphere allows you to specify geometries for points, lines, and polygons in the GeoJSON format. A point is given by a two-element array, representing [longitude, latitude]: { ""name"" : ""New York City"", ""loc"" : { ""type"" : ""Point"", ""coordinates"" : [50, 2] } } A line is given by an array of points: { ""name"" : ""Hudson River"", ""loc"" : { ""type"" : ""LineString"", ""coordinates"" : [[0,1], [0,2], [1,2]] } }"
"17. Explain the process of Sharding. MongoDB Interview Questions Sharding is the process of splitting data up across machines. We also use the term “partitioning” sometimes to describe this concept. We can store more data and handle more load without requiring larger or more powerful machines, by putting a subset of data on each machine. In the figure below, RS0 and RS1 are shards. MongoDB’s sharding allows you to create a cluster of many machines (shards) and break up a collection across them, putting a subset of data on each shard. This allows your application to grow beyond the resource limits of a standalone server or replica set. Sharded Client Connection MongoDB Interview Questions Non Sharded Client Connection"
"18. Explain the SET Modifier in MongoDB? If the value of a field does not yet exist, the ""$set"" sets the value. This can be useful for updating schemas or adding user-defined keys. Example: > db.users.findOne() { ""_id"" : ObjectId(""4b253b067525f35f94b60a31""), ""name"" : ""alice"", ""age"" : 23, ""sex"" : ""female"", ""location"" : ""India"" } To add a field to this, we use “$set”: > db.users.updateOne({""_id"" : ObjectId(""4b253b067525f35f94b60a31"")}, ... {""$set"" : {""favorite book"" : ""Start with Why""}}) MongoDB Interview Questions MongoDB Advanced Interview Questions"
"19. What do you mean by Transactions? A transaction is a logical unit of processing in a database that includes one or more database operations, which can be read or write operations. Transactions provide a useful feature in MongoDB to ensure consistency. MongoDB provides two APIs to use transactions. Core API: It is a similar syntax to relational databases (e.g., start_transaction and commit_transaction) Call-back API: This is the recommended approach to using transactions. It starts a transaction, executes the specified operations, and commits (or aborts on the error). It also automatically incorporates error handling logic for ""TransientTransactionError"" and""UnknownTransactionCommitResult""."
"20. What are MongoDB Charts? MongoDB Charts is a new, integrated tool in MongoDB for data visualization. MongoDB Charts oﬀers the best way to create visualizations using data from a MongoDB database. It allows users to perform quick data representation from a database without writing code in a programming language such as Java or Python. The two diﬀerent implementations of MongoDB Charts are: MongoDB Charts PaaS (Platform as a Service) MongoDB Charts Server"
"21. What is the Aggregation Framework in MongoDB? MongoDB Interview Questions The aggregation framework is a set of analytics tools within MongoDB that allow you to do analytics on documents in one or more collections. The aggregation framework is based on the concept of a pipeline. With an aggregation pipeline, we take input from a MongoDB collection and pass the documents from that collection through one or more stages, each of which performs a diﬀerent operation on its inputs (See figure below). Each stage takes as input whatever the stage before it produced as output. The inputs and outputs for all stages are documents—a stream of documents."
"22. Explain the concept of pipeline in the MongoDB aggregation framework. An individual stage of an aggregation pipeline is a data processing unit. It takes in a stream of input documents one at a time, processes each document one at a time, and produces an output stream of documents one at a time (see figure below). MongoDB Interview Questions"
"23. What is a Replica Set in MongoDB? To keep identical copies of your data on multiple servers, we use replication. It is recommended for all production deployments. Use replication to keep your application running and your data safe, even if something happens to one or more of your servers. Such replication can be created by a replica set with MongoDB. A replica set is a group of servers with one primary, the server taking writes, and multiple secondaries, servers that keep copies of the primary’s data. If the primary crashes, the secondaries can elect a new primary from amongst themselves."
"24. Explain the Replication Architecture in MongoDB. The following diagram depicts the architecture diagram of a simple replica set cluster with only three server nodes – one primary node and two secondary nodes: MongoDB Interview Questions In the preceding model, the PRIMARY database is the only active replica set member that receives write operations from database clients. The PRIMARY database saves data changes in the Oplog. Changes saved in the Oplog are sequential—that is, saved in the order that they are received and executed. The SECONDARY database is querying the PRIMARY database for new changes in the Oplog. If there are any changes, then Oplog entries are copied from PRIMARY to SECONDARY as soon as they are created on the PRIMARY node. Then, the SECONDARY database applies changes from the Oplog to its own datafiles. Oplog entries are applied in the same order they were inserted in the log. As a result, datafiles on SECONDARY are kept in sync with changes on PRIMARY. Usually, SECONDARY databases copy data changes directly from PRIMARY. Sometimes a SECONDARY database can replicate data from another SECONDARY. This type of replication is called Chained Replication because it is a two-step replication process. Chained replication is useful in certain replication topologies, and it is enabled by default in MongoDB."
"25. What are some utilities for backup and restore in MongoDB? MongoDB Interview Questions The mongo shell does not include functions for exporting, importing, backup, or restore. However, MongoDB has created methods for accomplishing this, so that no scripting work or complex GUIs are needed. For this, several utility scripts are provided that can be used to get data in or out of the database in bulk. These utility scripts are: mongoimport mongoexport mongodump mongorestore "
Flutter Interview Questions Flutter Interview Questions for Freshers
"1. Write the advantages of using flutter. For developing mobile applications, Flutter usually fulfills the custom needs and requirements. It oﬀers the following advantages: Flutter Interview Questions Reduce Code Development: Flutter's hot reload feature allows it to oﬀer faster performance. With it, the application gets compiled using the arm C/C++ library, making it closer to machine code and enabling it to run more quickly. The Flutter team has put lots of eﬀort into providing a wide variety of ready-to-use widgets. Most of them are incredibly customizable, saving your time like no other framework before. Cross-platform Development: Using Flutter, you can write code, manage, and run it across multiple platforms. For the developers, this saves time, money, and eﬀort. Live and Hot Reloading: This makes the app development process simpler and faster. Additionally, it also allows us to modify or update the code once a change is made. Similar to Native App performance: In contrast to most cross-platform frameworks, Flutter does not rely on intermediate code representations or interpretations. The Flutter application is built directly into the machine code, which eliminates any performance issues associated with the interpretation process. With Flutter, you get a fully compiled release application ahead of time. Good Community Support: Developers can ask questions about issues and get answers quickly. Little/Minimal Code: Each Flutter app is built using Dart programming language, which uses JIT and AOT compilation for faster startup time, faster performance, and smoother functionality. With the JIT feature, you can increase the speed of development and refresh the UI. Documentation: Flutter's documentation is well-organized and informative. It serves as a central repository for all written documents. Expressive and Flexible UI: Flutter oﬀers a customizable layered architecture that allows for highly customizable designs, expressive UIs, and fast rendering."
"2. Explain the flutter architecture. The structure of Flutter consists of three layers: Flutter Interview Questions Upper layers: The Dart-based platform that takes care of app widgets, gestures, animations, illustrations, and materials; Flutter engine: Handles the display and formatting of text. Built-in service: Used for the management of plugins, packages, and event loops."
"3. List some important features of flutter. Among the main features of flutter for developing mobile frameworks are: Flutter Interview Questions Flexibility, scalability, and integration: Flutter's easy-to-use and easy-to- integrate framework provides enhanced flexibility, scalability, and integration capabilities. Hot Reload: If the developer modifies the code, the changes can be seen immediately with Hot Reload. Thus, the changes are instantly visible within the app. One-Stop Solution: Flutter app development relies on a single framework and platform for the development, deployment, and management of changes, rather than using separate platforms and frameworks for diﬀerent purposes. Native Performance and Internationalized Flutter Libraries: Flutter app development provides widgets customized for Android, iOS, and Google Fuchsia. Using widgets, you can integrate all the functionalities of the platform, such as scrolling, navigation, icons, and fonts. Huge Widget Library: It is because of Flutter's ready-to-use widget library that developers can develop apps faster when using the framework. In addition to a wide variety of widgets, it also includes animations with which you can spice up your application."
"4. Write the limitations of flutter. Flutter Interview Questions Flutter has the following limitations: Third-party libraries are limited: Since Flutter is relatively new, the number of third-party libraries is small. Additionally, some widgets in Flutter are only available on one platform. Release size is larger: Developers get frustrated when the release size is not as expected. Requirements of Dart: Dart is an Object-oriented programming language, but it cannot compete with Java, JavaScript, or C# since it is still relatively new. As a result, not many developers choose it. Limited complexity: Flutter's 3D modeling, Unity integration, and game engines fall short. Therefore, most ad mobile platforms also don't support it. Lack of overall support: Flutter is not so widely used yet. Even though it enjoys the attention of tech enthusiasts, it still lacks the continuous support that will come with time. Currently, the only support that Flutter receives comes from its community."
"5. What are diﬀerent build modes in flutter? Depending on your development phase, the framework compiles your code in diﬀerent ways or modes, which we called a build mode. Flutter's tooling allows the application to be compiled in three modes. Depending on our stage of development, we may choose between these compilation modes. Flutter Interview Questions Debug Mode: This mode enables debugging of apps on a physical device, emulator, or simulator. Assertions and service extensions are enabled here. Quick deployment is then achieved by optimizing compilation. Profile Mode: In this mode, some debugging abilities are maintained, enough to analyze the app's performance while testing. Tracing and some extensions are enabled in this case. On emulators and simulators, profile mode is disabled since their behavior does not reproduce real-world performance. The following command can be used to compile the profile mode: flutter run --profile Release Mode: When deploying the app, this mode is used to minimize the size of the footprint and maximize optimization. Debugging, assertions and service extensions are disabled here. Faster startup, faster execution, and less size are its key features. The following command can be used to compile the release mode: flutter run --release"
"6. Explain the flutter widget and write its importance. Generally, a Flutter app consists of a number of widgets. A widget is a way to declare and construct user interfaces. In Flutter, you must write code inside a widget in order to build anything. With the widget, you can see how your app would appear with its current configuration. As soon as you modify the code, the widget will rebuild its description based on the diﬀerence between the old and new widget, and the changes will sync up with the UI of the app. The Flutter widget can be created as follows: Class ImageWidget extends StatelessWidget { // Class Stuff } The app is built by nesting widgets within each other. This means the root of your app is a widget, and everything below it is a widget. Here's a simple image of what the widget tree looks like: Flutter Interview Questions"
"7. What are the types of widgets present in flutter? In flutter, widgets can be divided into two categories: Flutter Interview Questions Stateless Widget: A widget that does nothing is a Stateless Widget. In essence, they are static and don’t store any state. Thus, they don't save values that may change. Stateful Widget: A widget that does anything is a Stateful Widget. Stateful widgets are dynamic by nature, which means they can monitor changes and update the UI accordingly."
"8. What do you mean by Dart? Write its importance. Dart, a programming language developed by Google, is used to code Flutter apps as well as server and desktop applications. By using Dart, Flutter avoids the use of a separate declarative layout language such as JSX or XML. A simple Dart program is shown in the following example: void main() { for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) { print('hello ${i + 1}'); } } An overview of Dart's importance: Developers can read and visualize the layout of Dart very easily and eﬀortlessly since it is declarative and programmatic. Unlike other programming languages, it supports the majority of the basic programming concepts like classes, interfaces, and functions. Arrays are not directly supported by Dart. Rather, it supports the collection that replicates the data structure like arrays, generics, and optional typing. Despite being similar to JavaScript, Dart runs code several times faster. For better performance and to reduce code execution time, the Dart virtual machine (VM) uses both Just-in-Time (JIT) and Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilers. Dart is object-oriented programming, which makes it very scalable and stable for creating even complex applications."
"9. Explain App state. Flutter Interview Questions App State may also be referred to as a shared state or application state. It is possible to share app states across sections of your app and maintain user sessions in the same way. Here are some examples of App State: Login info User preferences E-commerce shopping cart Social networking notifications, etc."
"10. Write the diﬀerence between runApp() and main() in flutter. main(): This function starts the program. Flutter does not allow us to write any program without the main() function. runApp(): Using runApp(), you are able to return the widgets that are connected to the screen as a root of the widget tree that will be rendered on the screen. This function is called in the main function, which is the driver of the app."
"11. Explain packages and plugins in Flutter. A package is a collection of classes, interfaces, and sub-packages that enable the creation of modular code that can be shared easily among users. Applications can be quickly developed using packages instead of developing everything from scratch. You can import new widgets or functionality into an app using a package in Flutter. There is a slight diﬀerence between plugins and packages as given below: Plugins: Using native code, enables more usability and makes it easier to use the device. Packages: These are new code or components written in the dart programming language. Packages and plugins are o"
"12. Name some best editors for flutter development. Flutter Interview Questions With the Flutter development tools, developers can make Flutter development faster and thus boost their productivity. In order to develop mobile applications, Flutter IDE and tools require some plugins. With these plugins, we can compile Dart, analyze code, and develop Flutter. Here are some popular IDEs for Flutter development: Android Studio Visual Studio IntelliJ IDEA Xcode Eclipse Emacs Vim, etc."
"13. Name some apps that mostly use flutter. Flutter is used today by many organizations for developing apps. The following are some of the most popular apps built on Flutter: Google Ads Reflectly Alibaba Birch Finance Coach Yourself Tencent Watermaniac, etc."
"14. What do you mean by keys in flutter? When one should use it. Keys are used in Flutter as identifiers for widgets, elements, and semantic nodes. GlobalKeys and LocalKeys are the subclasses of Key. Within the widget tree, keys are responsible for preserving the state of modified widgets. With keys, you can also reorganize and modify collections of widgets that have an equivalent type and defined state. The primary use of keys is to modify a widget tree that contains stateful widgets, not to modify a tree that is totally composed of stateless widgets."
"15. Explain Container class in a flutter. Flutter Interview Questions Basically, in Flutter, a container is a widget that has the capacity to accommodate multiple child widgets and manage them eﬀiciently through dimensions, padding, and background color. Whenever we want to style the background of a widget, either because of a color, shape, or size constraint, we may use a container widget. With the Container class, widgets can be stored and positioned on the screen at our discretion. In general, it resembles a box for storing contents. In the following image, you see how a basic container has padding, margin, and border properties surrounding its child widget:"
"16. Which one is better, either flutter or react native? Today, thousands of mobile apps are being built with the two most popular cross- platform development frameworks i.e., React Native and Flutter. There are many similarities between React Native and Flutter including reloading quickly, excellent UI, awesome tooling, and capability to build native apps. Flutter Interview Questions React Native: This is an entirely JavaScript-based application using React. Facebook backed and open-sourced it in 2015. Flutter: It is written in the Dart programming language. In comparison to React Native, Flutter is a relatively new framework. Flutter was originally backed by another giant called Google. Choosing between them is diﬀicult from the developer's perspective."
"17. When to use mainAxisAlignment and crossAxisAlignment. The mainAxisAlignment is how items are aligned on that axis, whereas crossAxisAlignment is how items are aligned on the other axis. Row and column widgets can align their children according to our preferences using the crossAxisAlignment and the mainAxisAlignment properties. As Children of the Row Widget are arranged horizontally. For Row: mainAxisAlignment = Horizontal Axis crossAxisAlignment = Vertical Axis This can be better understood by looking at the image below: Flutter Interview Questions As Children of the Column Widget are arranged vertically. For Column: mainAxisAlignment = Vertical Axis crossAxisAlignment = Horizontal Axis This can be better understood by looking at the image below: Flutter Interview Questions"
"18. Is Flutter Open Source or not? Yes, Flutter is a free and open-source UI so"
"19. Why does a flutter app usually take a long developing time? The first time you build a Flutter application, it takes much longer than usual since Flutter creates a device-specific IPA or APK file. Xcode and Gradle are used in this process to build a file, which usually takes a lot of time."
"20. Explain Flutter Inspector. In the same manner, as with Native Android, the XML file allows us to view our app's blueprint and properties. There is a powerful tool called Flutter Inspector for Flutter applications that allows you to visualize the blueprint of your widgets and their properties. Using it, you can diagnose various layout issues and understand the current layout. Flutter Inspector oﬀers the following benefits: Flutter Interview Questions Select widget mode Toggle platform Show paint baselines Show debug paint Refresh widget Enable slow animations Show/hide performance overlay"
21. What is the use of Ticker in Flutter? We use a ticker to tell how o
22. How would you execute code only in debug mode? We first need to import the dart foundation in order to run the code only in debug mode: import 'package:flutter/foundation.dart' as Foundation; The next step is to use kReleaseMode as follows: if (Foundation.kReleaseMode){ // is Release Mode?? print('release mode'); } else { print('debug mode'); }
"23. What is the use of Mixins? Multiple inheritances are not supported by Dart. Thus, we need mixins to implement multiple inheritances in Flutter/Dart. The use of mixins makes it easy to write reusable class code in multiple class hierarchy levels. Mixins can also be used to provide some utility functions (such as RenderSliverHelpers in Flutter). Flutter Interview Questions Flutter Interview Questions for Experienced"
"24. What do you mean by Streams? In asynchronous programming, streams are used to provide a sequence of data in an asynchronous manner. Similar to a pipe, we put a value on one end and a listener receives it on the other. Several listeners can be put into one stream, and they'll all get the same value when they're put in the pipeline. It's possible to create and manage streams through the SteamController. The Stream API provides the await for and listen() methods for processing streams. Streams can be created in many ways, but they can only be used in the same manner. Here is an example: Future<int> sumStream(Stream<int> stream) async { var sum = 0; await for (var value in stream) { sum += value; } return sum; }"
"25. What are diﬀerent types of Streams? The streams’ functionality is part of Dart and is inherited by Flutter. In Flutter, there are two kinds of streams: Flutter Interview Questions Single Subscription Streams: These streams deliver events sequentially. They are considered as sequences contained within a larger whole. These streams are used when the order in which events are received matters, such as reading a file. There can be only one listener throughout the sequence, and without a listener, the event won't be triggered. Broadcast Streams: These streams deliver events to their subscribers. Upon subscribing to events, subscribers are immediately able to start listening to them. These are versatile streams that allow several listeners to listen simultaneously. Furthermore, one can listen again even a"
26. What do you mean by flutter SDK? A Flutter SDK (So
"27. Write diﬀerence between Hot reload and Hot restart. For any dart application, the initial execution requires a fair amount of time. Therefore, to solve this problem, flutter has two features: Hot Reload and Hot Restart, which reduce the execution time of our app a"
"28. Explain BuildContext. BuildContexts are used to identify or locate widgets in widget trees. Each widget has its own BuildContext, i.e., one BuildContext per widget. Basically, we're using it to find references to other widgets and themes. In addition, you can utilize it to interact with widget parents and access widget data."
"29. What do you mean by Widget testing? Flutter supports three types of tests: Flutter Interview Questions Unit tests: Using unit testing, you can test a class or method. Unit tests do not check for rendering to screen, interacting with external services, or user interactions. Widget tests: Using widget testing, you can test a single widget. This ensures that the widget's UI looks as expected and responds appropriately to events. In other words, it ensures that the widget design, rendering, and interaction with other widgets are up to the mark. Integration tests: Using Integration testing, you can test the critical flows of the entire app. It is important to check whether all widgets and services work together as expected. You can also use it to measure and benchmark the performance of your app."
"30. What is state management? Whether you are building a mobile app or a web application, State Management is crucial. Using it, states of various UI controls are centralized to handle data flow across an application. It can be a text field, radio button, checkbox, dropdown, toggle, form, and so on. In Flutter, state management can be categorized into two types as follows: Ephemeral State: Ephemeral state is also called UI state or local state, and it pertains to a particular widget. In other words, it is a state that is contained within the specific widget. By means of StatefulWidget, Flutter provides support for this state. App State: This is diﬀerent from the ephemeral state since it is a state that we intend to share across diﬀerent parts of the app and which we want to maintain between sessions. These types of states can thus be used globally. By means of scoped_model, Flutter provides support for this state. The following diagram gives a better explanation of the diﬀerences between ephemeral and app states: Flutter Interview Questions The pubspec.yaml file, also known as 'pubspec', is a file that is included when you create a Flutter project and is located at the top of the project tree. This file contains information about the dependencies like packages and their versions, fonts, etc., that a project requires. It makes sure that the next time you build the project, you will get the same package version. Additionally, you can set constraints for the app. During working with the Flutter project, this configuration file of the project will be required a lot. This specification is written in YAML, which can be read by humans. The following are included in this file: General project settings, like name of the project, version, description, etc. Dependencies within a project. The assets of the project (e.g., images, audio, etc.)."
"32. What do you understand about tween animation? The shortened version of in-between animation is tween animation. The start and endpoints of an animation must be specified in tween animation. Using this method, the animation can begin at the beginning and can progress through a series of values until it reaches the endpoint. Transition speed and duration are also determined by using the tween animation. Calculating the transition from the beginning to the end will be easier with the widget framework."
"33. How can we create HTTP requests in Flutter? To create HTTP requests, use the HTTP package (import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;). In the following manner, we can make the Requests: http.get(‘https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/albums/1‘); It will return a Future <http.Response>."
"34. Name two database packages mostly used in Flutter. As far as Flutter is concerned, the following database packages are widely accepted and mostly used: Flutter Interview Questions Firebase database: It gives users access to and control over the cloud database. Firebase basically provides a NoSQL database for Flutter apps with the ability to manage data retrieval and storage through JSON protocol. Data sync and quick loading make it one of the most suitable options for Flutter Apps. Features: NoSQL DB APIs (REST only) Authentication Analytics Storage SQFlite database: Users can access and modify the SQLite database using this. With this database, you have full control over your database, queries, relationships, and anything you could desire. Features: Serverless Zero configuration Open-Source Compact Single DB file"
"35. Explain Flutter Provider. The provider is built using widgets. You can use all the objects in the provider as if they were just part of Flutter with the new widget subclasses it creates. This also means that the provider is not cross-platform. The provider is the simplest way to handle state management. Basically, it works on the concept of PUB-SUB i.e., there is one provider and several subscribers."
"36. What is await in Flutter? Write it's usage. Until the async method is finished, await interrupts the process flow. Await generally means: Wait here until this function is finished so that you can get its return value. Await can only be used with async. Using this, all currently running functions are put on hold until PF nature is complete. Flutter Interview Questions"
"37. Write the diﬀerence between SizedBox Vs Container. Container: In this parent widget, multiple child widgets can be easily controlled and handled by adjusting their size, padding, and color eﬀiciently. We can wrap a widget in a container widget if it needs any styling, like a color, a shape, or a size constraint, etc. SizedBox: This is a specific size box. It does not allow us to set the widget's color or decoration, unlike Container. In this case, we only need to resize the widget that is passed as a child. In other words, it forces its child widget to have a specific size."
"AWS Lambda Interview Questions It is a huge neighbourhood that provides access to a lot of job options. Because of the requirement to work with such a diverse selection of languages, an extensive range of job opportunities are currently available, including those in the fields of system engineering, internet of things architecture, and cloud support associates. As a result, each year, individuals who have recently graduated as well as seasoned experts look for possibilities to enter the sector of serverless computing. The AWS Lambda Development industry is loaded with opportunities waiting to be taken advantage of. The following is a collection of answers to various questions that could be asked of you during the interview, such as ""What is AWS Lambda"" and ""AWS Lambda Interview Questions and Answers 2023."" AWS Lambda Interview Questions for Freshers"
"1. What is ""AWS Lambda""? Lambda, a so"
"2. Is there a programming language that AWS Lambda is not compatible with? AWS Lambda allows for the use of the following programming languages: C#, .NET, Node.js, Javascript, Java (version 8), and Go. These programming languages already have their libraries and other built-in features set up and ready to go."

"25. Is there a limit to the number of AWS lambda functions that can run in parallel at the same time? Because the AWS lambda application was designed to work only on certain instances of functional codes, the answer is ""no."" In addition, there is a default safety threshold in AWS lambda for a specific number of consecutive executions for each subscription. This barrier is based on the number of executions. You will be able to save your most important resources for the times when they are required the most if you restrict the number of times that a single AWS function can execute a lambda in succession."
"26. What will happen if the total amount of my execution goes beyond the normal limit? The AWS Lambda functions are called in real time whenever the threshold is exceeded, and the threshold error is returned (429 errors –code). A substantial quantity of traﬀic may be handled by Lambda functions for 15–30 minutes at a time, and they can be run asynchronously in order to fulfil their primary objectives. The operation will come to a close by filtering out and slowing down upcoming events. A"
"27. What is a Serverless Application? The serverless applications are lambda-based, which means that they are made up of functions that are triggered into action in response to particular events. Every one of the functional events, such as an item being uploaded to Amazon S3, an Amazon SNS message being received, or an API request being made, will activate one or more functions in the default serverless application. These methods can function independently, making use of other Amazon Web Services (AWS) technologies such as DynamoDB tables and S3 buckets. The most popular kind of serverless application is called a function."
28. How might we benefit if we did away with the requirement of having a server? The following is a list of the primary advantages of using the Serverless method:

In the paradigm of cloud computing that is most prevalent today, the customer is responsible for paying for a set amount of server time regardless of whether or not they actually make use of that time."
"44. What kinds of storage options does Amazon provide its customers with? For instance, Amazon provides customers with a diverse range of storage options, all of which rank among the very best in terms of dependability and eﬀectiveness. You are free to combine them if you so like. It is also possible to acquire access to one's own volition. The first kind of storage is called EBS, and it uses a format that is block- level. When you require encrypted storage in addition to segregated storage, this is an excellent option to take into consideration. The EC2 Instance store is the next type, and it is similar to a hard disc in that it is tied directly to the host PC. It is a terrific option that should be explored for your needs in the short term. It is only when the instance is operational that the data stored on this storage will be reliable. If the same is deleted, then the data would be gone. When we talk about ""Adding Storage,"" we're referring to a distinct category of storage. When the root storage device is initially created, an instance is started up automatically. Data relating to boot instances are frequently included in it. Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) is yet another storage option, and it is well- known for being an aﬀordable alternative that can store any quantity of data. This feature is one of its most appealing selling points."

To ensure that everyone is able to keep up with the hectic pace, the security team has established regulations that can be modified over time."
"47. In the context of Lambda, what precisely does it mean to speak of elastic blockage storage? The term ""virtual storage area network"" (VSAN) refers to a logical subnetwork that is contained within a larger ""physical storage area network"" (SAN). Because of the capabilities of isolation provided by virtual storage area networks, when a problem occurs in one logical partition of a storage area network, it is possible to address it with minimal impact on the remainder of the network. This is because of the fact that a storage area network is composed of multiple logical partitions (VSANs). It is very much like a VSAN, which stands for virtual storage area network, with the exception that it is utilized to kick oﬀ activities. Users of a RAID system do not need to be concerned about the loss of their data in the event that a disc in the RAID fails because the system is able to handle failures in a gracious manner. The provisioning and allocation of storage space is also something that can be done using Elastic Block Storage. Another method is to link it up to the application programming interface (API)."

"54. Where can I find more information about the Final Variables and Eﬀectively Final Variables of Lambda? Once they have been allocated, changes to Final Variables are not allowed under any circumstances. When they are in their more malleable early stage, we say that they have essentially variable characteristics. They do not currently have a value associated with them. Eﬀective variables are utilized because many scenarios require the outcome to be unrestricted; as a result, many circumstances ask for the outcome to be unrestricted. They are useful in testing in their own right. It is possible to use Eﬀective Variables to endow final variables with a wide variety of additional properties by employing this technique. The majority of the time, Lambda's local expressions are final."
"55. Where exactly is the functionality that Lambda was designed for? Reading data from the Internet of Things devices, monitoring the responses of sensors, and reacting to user clicks on a website are just some of the possible applications for AWS Lambda.

Whenever you feel the need for a new EC2 instance, you can go ahead and create an on-demand instance. It is cheap for the short-time but not when taken for the long term. Spot Instance - These types of instances can be bought through the bidding model. These are comparatively cheaper than On-Demand Instances. Reserved Instance - On AWS, you can create instances that you can reserve for a year or so. These types of instances are especially useful when you know in advance that you will be needing an instance for the long term. In such cases, you can create a reserved instance and save heavily on costs."
"20. What do you understand by stopping and terminating an EC2 Instance? Stopping an EC2 instance means to shut it down as you would normally do on your Personal Computer. This will not delete any volumes attached to the instance and the instance can be started again when needed. On the other hand, terminating an instance is equivalent to deleting an instance. All the volumes attached to the instance get deleted and it is not possible to restart the instance if needed at a later point in time."
"21. What are the consistency models for modern DBs oﬀered by AWS? AWS Interview Questions Eventual Consistency - It means that the data will be consistent eventually, but may not be immediate. This will serve the client requests faster, but chances are that some of the initial read requests may read the stale data. This type of consistency is preferred in systems where data need not be real-time. For example, if you don’t see the recent tweets on Twitter or recent posts on Facebook for a couple of seconds, it is acceptable. Strong Consistency - It provides an immediate consistency where the data will be consistent across all the DB Servers immediately. Accordingly. This model may take some time to make the data consistent and subsequently start serving the requests again. However, in this model, it is guaranteed that all the responses will always have consistent data."
"22. What is Geo-Targeting in CloudFront? Geo-Targeting enables the creation of customized content based on the geographic location of the user. This allows you to serve the content which is more relevant to a user. For example, using Geo-Targeting, you can show the news related to local body elections to a user sitting in India, which you may not want to show to a user sitting in the US. Similarly, the news related to Baseball Tournament can be more relevant to a user sitting in the US, and not so relevant for a user sitting in India."
"23. What are the advantages of AWS IAM? AWS IAM enables an administrator to provide granular level access to diﬀerent users and groups. Diﬀerent users and user groups may need diﬀerent levels of access to diﬀerent resources created. With IAM, you can create roles with specific access-levels and assign the roles to the users. It also allows you to provide access to the resources to users and applications without creating the IAM Roles, which is known as Federated Access."
"24. What do you understand by a Security Group? When you create an instance in AWS, you may or may not want that instance to be accessible from the public network. Moreover, you may want that instance to be accessible from some networks and not from others. AWS Interview Questions Security Groups are a type of rule-based Virtual Firewall using which you can control access to your instances. You can create rules defining the Port Numbers, Networks, or protocols from which you want to allow access or deny access."
"25. What are Spot Instances and On-Demand Instances? When AWS creates EC2 instances, there are some blocks of computing capacity and processing power le"
"26. Explain Connection Draining. Connection Draining is a feature provided by AWS which enables your servers which are either going to be updated or removed, to serve the current requests. If Connection Draining is enabled, the Load Balancer will allow an outgoing instance to complete the current requests for a specific period but will not send any new request to it. Without Connection Draining, an outgoing instance will immediately go oﬀ and the requests pending on that instance will error out."
"27. What is a Stateful and a Stateless Firewall? A Stateful Firewall is the one that maintains the state of the rules defined. It requires you to define only inbound rules. Based on the inbound rules defined, it automatically allows the outbound traﬀic to flow. On the other hand, a Stateless Firewall requires you to explicitly define rules for inbound as well as outbound traﬀic. For example, if you allow inbound traﬀic from Port 80, a Stateful Firewall will allow outbound traﬀic to Port 80, but a Stateless Firewall will not do so."
"28. What is a Power User Access in AWS? AWS Interview Questions An Administrator User will be similar to the owner of the AWS Resources. He can create, delete, modify or view the resources and also grant permissions to other users for the AWS Resources. A Power User Access provides Administrator Access without the capability to manage the users and permissions. In other words, a user with Power User Access can create, delete, modify or see the resources, but he cannot grant permissions to other users."
"29. What is an Instance Store Volume and an EBS Volume? An Instance Store Volume is temporary storage that is used to store the temporary data required by an instance to function. The data is available as long as the instance is running. As soon as the instance is turned oﬀ, the Instance Store Volume gets removed and the data gets deleted. On the other hand, an EBS Volume represents a persistent storage disk. The data stored in an EBS Volume will be available even a"
30. What are Recovery Time Objective and Recovery Point Objective in AWS? Recovery Time Objective - It is the maximum acceptable delay between the interruption of service and restoration of service. This translates to an acceptable time window when the service can be unavailable. Recover Point Objective - It is the maximum acceptable amount of time since the last data restore point. It translates to the acceptable amount of data loss which lies between the last recovery point and the interruption of service.
"31. Is there a way to upload a file that is greater than 100 Megabytes in Amazon S3? Yes, it is possible by using the Multipart Upload Utility from AWS. With the Multipart Upload Utility, larger files can be uploaded in multiple parts that are uploaded independently. You can also decrease upload time by uploading these parts in parallel. A"
"32. Can you change the Private IP Address of an EC2 instance while it is running or in a stopped state? No, a Private IP Address of an EC2 instance cannot be changed. When an EC2 instance is launched, a private IP Address is assigned to that instance at the boot time. This private IP Address is attached to the instance for its entire lifetime and can never be changed."
33. What is the use of lifecycle hooks is Autoscaling? Lifecycle hooks are used for Auto-scaling to put an additional wait time to a scale-in or a scale-out event.
"TypeScript Interview Questions TypeScript files use a .ts extension, in contrast to the .js extension used by the JavaScript files. Since TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, all valid JavaScript code is a valid TypeScript code, and renaming a .js file to .ts won’t change anything. Here is an example of a standard TypeScript program that adds two numbers and returns the result. Notice how the arguments and the return types are annotated with their type. function add(a: number, b: number): number { const sum = a + b; return sum; } When you compile a TypeScript file using the tsc command, the Typescript compiler generates vanilla JavaScript that gets executed. For example, this is what the compiler will produce for the above snippet of code. function add(a, b) { const sum = a + b; return sum; } TypeScript Interview Questions TypeScript adds optional static typing and language features such as classes and modules. It’s important to know that all these advanced features add zero cost to JavaScript. A typeScript is purely a compile-time tool. Once you compile, you are le"
"1. What are the primitive types in TypeScript? TypeScript has three primitive types that are frequently used: string, number, and boolean. These correspond to the similarly named types in JavaScript. string: represents text values such as “javascript”, “typescript”, etc. number: represents numeric values like 1, 2, 32, 43, etc. boolean: represents a variable that can have either a ‘true’ or ‘false’ value."
"2. Explain how the arrays work in TypeScript. We use arrays to store values of the same type. Arrays are ordered and indexed collections of values. The indexing starts at 0, i.e., the first element has index 0, the second has index 1, and so on. Here is the syntax to declare and initialize an array in TypeScript. let values: number[] = []; values[0] = 10; values[1] = 20; values[2] = 30; You can also create an array using the short-hand syntax as follows: TypeScript Interview Questions let values: number[] = [15, 20, 25, 30]; TypeScript provides an alternate syntax to specify the Array type. let values: Array<number> = [15, 20, 25, 30];"
"3. What is any type, and when to use it? There are times when you want to store a value in a variable but don’t know the type of that variable in advance. For example, the value is coming from an API call or the user input. The ‘any’ type allows you to assign a value of any type to the variable of type any. let person: any = ""Foo""; Here is an example that demonstrates the usage of any type. // json may come from a third-party API const employeeData: string = `{""name"": ""John Doe"", ""salary"": 60000}`; // parse JSON to build employee object const employee: any = JSON.parse(employeeData); console.log(employee.name); console.log(employee.salary); TypeScript assumes a variable is of type any when you don’t explicitly provide the type, and the compiler cannot infer the type from the surrounding context."
"4. What is void, and when to use the void type? The void indicates the absence of type on a variable. It acts as the opposite type to any. It is especially useful in functions that don’t return a value. function notify(): void { alert(""The user has been notified.""); } TypeScript Interview Questions If a variable is of type void, you can only assign the null or undefined values to that variable."
"5. What is an unknown type, and when to use it in TypeScript? The unknown type is the type-safe counterpart of any type. You can assign anything to the unknown, but the unknown isn’t assignable to anything but itself and any, without performing a type assertion of a control-flow-based narrowing. You cannot perform any operations on a variable of an unknown type without first asserting or narrowing it to a more specific type. Consider the following example. We create the foo variable of unknown type and assign a string value to it. If we try to assign that unknown variable to a string variable bar, the compiler gives an error. let foo: unknown = ""Akshay""; let bar: string = foo; // Type 'unknown' is not assignable to type 'string'.(2322) You can narrow down a variable of an unknown type to something specific by doing typeof checks or comparison checks or using type guards. For example, we can get rid of the above error by let foo: unknown = ""Akshay""; let bar: string = foo as string;"
"6. What are the diﬀerent keywords to declare variables in TypeScript? var: Declares a function-scoped or global variable. You can optionally set its value during the declaration. Its behavior and scoping rules are similar to the var keyword in JavaScript. For example, var foo = ""bar""; let: Declares a block-scoped local variable. Similar to var, you can optionally set the value of a variable during the declaration. For example, TypeScript Interview Questions let a = 5; if (true) { let a = 10; console.log(a); // 10 } console.log(a); // 5 const: Declares a block-scoped constant value that cannot be changed a"
"7. Provide the syntax of a function with the type annotations. Functions are blocks of code to perform a specific code. Functions can optionally take one or more arguments, process them, and optionally return a value. Here’s the TypeScript syntax to create and call a function. function greet(name: string): string { return `Hello, ${name}`; } let greeting = greet(""Anders""); console.log(greeting); // ""Hello, Anders"""
"8. How to create objects in TypeScript? Objects are dictionary-like collections of keys and values. The keys have to be unique. They are similar to arrays and are also sometimes called associative arrays. However, an array uses numbers to index the values, whereas an object allows you to use any other type as the key. In TypeScript, an Object type refers to any value with properties. It can be defined by simply listing the properties and their types. For example, TypeScript Interview Questions let pt: { x: number; y: number } = { x: 10, y: 20 };"
9. How to specify optional properties in TypeScript? An object type can have zero or more optional properties by adding a ‘?’ a
"10. Explain the concept of null and its use in TypeScript. In programming, a null value indicates an absence of value. A null variable doesn’t point to any object. Hence you cannot access any properties on the variable or call a method on it. In TypeScript, the null value is indicated by the ‘null’ keyword. You can check if a value is null as follows: function greet(name: string | null) { if (name === null) { console.log(""Name is not provided""); } else { console.log(""Good morning, "" + name.toUpperCase()); } } var foo = null; greet(foo); // ""Name is not provided"" foo = ""Anders""; greet(foo); // ""Good morning, ANDERS"" TypeScript Interview Questions"
"11. What is undefined in TypeScript? When a variable is declared without initialization, it’s assigned the undefined value. It’s not very useful on its own. A variable is undefined if it’s declared, but no value has been assigned to it. In contrast, null is assigned to a variable, and it represents no value. console.log(null == null); // true console.log(undefined == undefined); // true console.log(null == undefined); // true, with type-conversion console.log(null === undefined); // false, without type-conversion console.log(0 == undefined); // false console.log('' == undefined); // false console.log(false == undefined); // false"
"12. Explain the purpose of the never type in TypeScript. As the name suggests, the never type represents the type of values that never occur. For example, a function that never returns a value or that always throws an exception can mark its return type as never. function error(message: string): never { throw new Error(message); } You might wonder why we need a ‘never’ type when we already have ‘void’. Though both types look similar, they represent two very diﬀerent concepts. A function that doesn't return a value implicitly returns the value undefined in JavaScript. Hence, even though we are saying it’s not returning anything, it’s returning ‘undefined’. We usually ignore the return value in these cases. Such a function is inferred to have a void return type in TypeScript. TypeScript Interview Questions // This function returns undefined function greet(name: string) { console.log(`Hello, ${name}`); } let greeting = greet(""David""); console.log(greeting); // undefined In contrast, a function that has a never return type never returns. It doesn't return undefined, either. There are 2 cases where functions should return never type:"
1. In an unending loop e.g a while(true){} type loop.
2. A function that throws an error e.g function foo(){throw new Exception('Error message')}
"13. Explain how enums work in TypeScript? Enums allow us to create named constants. It is a simple way to give more friendly names to numeric constant values. An enum is defined by the keyword enum, followed by its name and the members. Consider the following example that defines an enum Team with four values in it. enum Team { Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta } let t: Team = Team.Delta; By default, the enums start the numbering at 0. You can override the default numbering by explicitly assigning the values to its members. TypeScript also lets you create enums with string values as follows: enum Author { Anders = ""Anders"", Hejlsberg = ""Hejlsberg"" }; TypeScript Interview Questions"
"14. What is the typeof operator? How is it used in TypeScript? Similar to JavaScript, the typeof operator in TypeScript returns the type of the operand as a string. console.log(typeof 10); // ""number"" console.log(typeof 'foo'); // ""string"" console.log(typeof false); // ""boolean"" console.log(typeof bar); // ""undefined"" In TypeScript, you can use the typeof operator in a type context to refer to the type of a property or a variable. let greeting = ""hello""; let typeOfGreeting: typeof greeting; // similar to let typeOfGreeting: string"
"15. What are the rest parameters and arguments in TypeScript? A rest parameter allows a function to accept an indefinite number of arguments as an array. It is denoted by the ‘…’ syntax and indicates that the function can accept one or more arguments. function add(...values: number[]) { let sum = 0; values.forEach(val => sum += val); return sum; } const sum = add(5, 10, 15, 20); console.log(sum); // 50 In contrast, the rest arguments allow a function caller to provide a variable number of arguments from an array. Consider the following example. TypeScript Interview Questions const first = [1, 2, 3]; const second = [4, 5, 6]; first.push(...second); console.log(first); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]"
"16. What is parameter destructuring? Parameter destructing allows a function to unpack the object provided as an argument into one or more local variables. function multiply({ a, b, c }: { a: number; b: number; c: number }) { console.log(a * b * c); } multiply({ a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 }); You can simplify the above code by using an interface or a named type, as follows: type ABC = { a: number; b: number; c: number }; function multiply({ a, b, c }: ABC) { console.log(a * b * c); } multiply({ a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 });"
"17. Explain the TypeScript class syntax. TypeScript fully supports classes. The TypeScript syntax for class declaration is similar to that of JavaScript, with the added type support for the member declarations. Here is a simple class that defines an Employee type. TypeScript Interview Questions class Employee { name: string; salary: number; constructor(name: string, salary: number) { this.name = name; this.salary = salary; } promote() : void { this.salary += 10000; } } You can create an instance (or object) of a class by using the new keyword. // Create a new employee let john = new Employee(""John"", 60000); console.log(john.salary); // 60000 john.promote(); console.log(john.salary); // 70000"
"18. Explain the arrow function syntax in TypeScript. Arrow functions provide a short and convenient syntax to declare functions. They are also called lambdas in other programming languages. Consider a regular function that adds two numbers and returns a number. function add(x: number, y: number): number { let sum = x + y; return sum; } Using arrow functions syntax, the same function can be defined as: let add = (x: number, y: number): number => { let sum = x + y; return sum; } TypeScript Interview Questions You can further simplify the syntax by getting rid of the brackets and the return statement. This is allowed when the function body consists of only one statement. For example, if we remove the temporary sum variable, we can rewrite the above function as: let add = (x: number, y: number): number => x + y; Arrow functions are o"
"19. Provide the syntax for optional parameters in TypeScript. A function can mark one or more of its parameters as optional by suﬀixing its name with ‘?’. In the example below, the parameter greeting is marked optional. function greet(name: string, greeting?: string) { if (!greeting) greeting = ""Hello""; console.log(`${greeting}, ${name}`); } greet(""John"", ""Hi""); // Hi, John greet(""Mary"", ""Hola""); // Hola, Mary greet(""Jane""); // Hello, Jane"
"20. What is the purpose of the tsconfig.json file? A tsconfig.json file in a directory marks that directory as the root of a TypeScript project. It provides the compiler options to compile the project. TypeScript Interview Questions Here is a sample tsconfig.json file: { ""compilerOptions"": { ""module"": ""system"", ""noImplicitAny"": true, ""removeComments"": true, ""outFile"": ""../../built/local/tsc.js"", ""sourceMap"": true }, ""include"": [""src/**/*""], ""exclude"": [""node_modules"", ""**/*.spec.ts""] } Typescript Interview Questions for Experienced"
"21. Explain the diﬀerent variants of the for loop in TypeScript. TypeScript provides the following three ways to loop over collections. ‘for’ loop let values = [10, ""foo"", true]; for(let i=0; i<values.length; i++) { console.log(values[i]); // 10, ""foo"", true } ‘forEach’ function let values = [10, ""foo"", true]; values.forEach(val => { console.log(val); // 10, ""foo"", true }) ‘for..of’ statement let values = [10, ""foo"", true]; for (let val of values) { console.log(val); // 10, ""foo"", true } TypeScript Interview Questions"
"22. Explain the symbol type in TypeScript. Symbols were introduced in ES6 and are supported by TypeScript. Similar to numbers and strings, symbols are primitive types. You can use Symbols to create unique properties for objects. You can create symbol values by calling the Symbol() constructor, optionally providing a string key. let foo = Symbol(); let bar = Symbol(""bar""); // optional string key A key characteristic of symbols is that they are unique and immutable. let foo = Symbol(""foo""); let newFoo = Symbol(""foo""); let areEqual = foo === newFoo; console.log(areEqual); // false, symbols are unique"
"23. Explain how optional chaining works in TypeScript. Optional chaining allows you to access properties and call methods on them in a chain-like fashion. You can do this using the ‘?.’ operator. TypeScript immediately stops running some expression if it runs into a ‘null’ or ‘undefined’ value and returns ‘undefined’ for the entire expression chain. Using optional chaining, the following expression let x = foo === null || foo === undefined ? undefined : foo.bar.baz(); can be expressed as: let x = foo?.bar.baz();"
"24. Provide the TypeScript syntax to create function overloads. TypeScript Interview Questions Function overloading allows us to define multiple functions with the same name, as long as their number of parameters or the types of parameters are diﬀerent. The following example defines two overloads for the function buildDate. The first overload takes a number as a parameter, whereas the second takes three numbers as parameters. These are called overload signatures. The body of the function also called an implementation signature, follows the overload signatures. You can’t call this signature directly, as it’s not visible from the outside. It should be compatible with the overload signatures. function buildDate(timestamp: number): Date; function buildDate(m: number, d: number, y: number): Date; function buildDate(mOrTimestamp: number, d?: number, y?: number): Date { if (d !== undefined && y !== undefined) { return new Date(y, mOrTimestamp, d); } else { return new Date(mOrTimestamp); } } const d1 = buildDate(87654321); const d2 = buildDate(2, 2, 2);"
"25. What is meant by type inference? TypeScript can infer the type of a variable when you don’t provide an explicit type. This is known as type inference. This is usually done when the variables or parameters are initialized during the declaration. For example, TypeScript knows that the variable foo is a string, even though we don’t mention string as a type. let foo = ""this is a string""; console.log(typeof foo); // ""string"""
"26. What is meant by contextual typing? When the TypeScript compiler uses the location (or context) of a variable to infer its type, it’s called contextual typing. TypeScript Interview Questions In the following example, TypeScript uses the Window.onmousedown function type information to infer the type of the function expression on the right-hand side of the assignment. This allows it to infer the type of the e parameter, which does have a button property but not a property named foo. window.onmousedown = function (e) { console.log(e.button); //<- OK console.log(e.foo); //<- Error! };"
"27. What is the purpose of noImplicitAny? Usually, when we don’t provide any type on a variable, TypeScript assumes ‘any’ type. For example, TypeScript compiles the following code, assuming the parameter ‘s’ is of any type. It works as long as the caller passes a string. function parse(s) { console.log(s.split(' ')); } parse(""Hello world""); // [""Hello"", ""world""] However, the code breaks down as soon as we pass a number or other type than a string that doesn’t have a split() method on it. For example, function parse(s) { console.log(s.split(' ')); // [ERR]: s.split is not a function } parse(10); noImplicitAny is a compiler option that you set in the tsconfig.json file. It forces the TypeScript compiler to raise an error whenever it infers a variable is of any type. This prevents us from accidentally causing similar errors. Parameter 's' implicitly has an 'any' type.(7006) function parse(s) { console.log(s.split(' ')); // [ERR]: s.split is not a function } TypeScript Interview Questions"
"28. What is an interface? An interface defines a contract by specifying the type of data an object can have and its operations. In TypeScript, you can specify an object’s shape by creating an interface and using it as its type. It’s also called “duck typing”. In TypeScript, you can create and use an interface as follows: interface Employee { name: string; salary: number; } function process(employee: Employee) { console.log(`${employee.name}'s salary = ${employee.salary}`); } let john: Employee = { name: ""John Doe"", salary: 150000 } process(john); // ""John Doe's salary = 150000"" Interfaces are an eﬀective way to specify contracts within your code as well as outside your code."
"29. Explain the various ways to control member visibility in TypeScript. TypeScript provides three keywords to control the visibility of class members, such as properties or methods. public: You can access a public member anywhere outside the class. All class members are public by default. protected: A protected member is visible only to the subclasses of the class containing that member. Outside code that doesn’t extend the container class can’t access a protected member. private: A private member is only visible inside the class. No outside code can access the private members of a class. TypeScript Interview Questions"
"30. Does TypeScript support static classes? If not, why? TypeScript doesn’t support static classes, unlike the popular object-oriented programming languages like C# and Java. These languages need static classes because all code, i.e., data and functions, need to be inside a class and cannot exist independently. Static classes provide a way to allow these functions without associating them with any objects. In TypeScript, you can create any data and functions as simple objects without creating a containing class. Hence TypeScript doesn’t need static classes. A singleton class is just a simple object in TypeScript."
"31. What are abstract classes? When should you use one? Abstract classes are similar to interfaces in that they specify a contract for the objects, and you cannot instantiate them directly. However, unlike interfaces, an abstract class may provide implementation details for one or more of its members. An abstract class marks one or more of its members as abstract. Any classes that extend an abstract class have to provide an implementation for the abstract members of the superclass. Here is an example of an abstract class Writer with two member functions. The write() method is marked as abstract, whereas the greet() method has an implementation. Both the FictionWriter and RomanceWriter classes that extend from Writer have to provide their specific implementation for the write method. TypeScript Interview Questions abstract class Writer { abstract write(): void; greet(): void { console.log(""Hello, there. I am a writer.""); } } class FictionWriter extends Writer { write(): void { console.log(""Writing a fiction.""); } } class RomanceWriter extends Writer { write(): void { console.log(""Writing a romance novel.""); } } const john = new FictionWriter(); john.greet(); // ""Hello, there. I am a writer."" john.write(); // ""Writing a fiction."" const mary = new RomanceWriter(); mary.greet(); // ""Hello, there. I am a writer."" mary.write(); // ""Writing a romance novel."""
"32. What are anonymous functions? Provide their syntax in TypeScript. An anonymous function is a function without a name. Anonymous functions are typically used as callback functions, i.e., they are passed around to other functions, only to be invoked by the other function at a later point in time. For example, setTimeout(function () { console.log('Run after 2 seconds') }, 2000); You can invoke an anonymous function as soon as it’s created. It’s called ‘immediately (function() { console.log('Invoked immediately after creation'); })(); TypeScript Interview Questions"
"33. What are union types in TypeScript? A union type is a special construct in TypeScript that indicates that a value can be one of several types. A vertical bar (|) separates these types. Consider the following example where the variable value belongs to a union type consisting of strings and numbers. The value is initialized to string “Foo”. Because it can only be a string or a number, we can change it to a number later, and the TypeScript compiler doesn’t complain. let value: string | number = ""Foo""; value = 10; // Okay However, if we try to set the value to a type not included in the union types, we get the following error. value = true; // Type 'boolean' is not assignable to type 'string | number'.(2322) Union types allow you to create new types out of existing types. This removes a lot of boilerplate code as you don’t have to create new classes and type hierarchies."
34. What are intersection types? Intersection types let you combine the members of two or more types by using the ‘&’ operator. This allows you to combine existing types to get a single type with all the features you need. The following example creates a new type Supervisor that has the members of types Employee and Manager. TypeScript Interview Questions interface Employee { work: () => string; } interface Manager { manage: () => string; } type Supervisor = Employee & Manager; // john can both work and manage let john: Supervisor;
"35. What are type aliases? How do you create one? Type aliases give a new, meaningful name for a type. They don’t create new types but create new names that refer to that type. For example, you can alias a union type to avoid typing all the types everywhere that value is being used. type alphanumeric = string | number; let value: alphanumeric = """"; value = 10;"
"36. Explain the tuple types in TypeScript. Tuples are a special type in TypeScript. They are similar to arrays with a fixed number of elements with a known type. However, the types need not be the same. // Declare a tuple type and initialize it let values: [string, number] = [""Foo"", 15]; // Type 'boolean' is not assignable to type 'string'.(2322) // Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'.(2322) let wrongValues: [string, number] = [true, ""hello""]; // Error Since TypeScript 3.0, a tuple can specify one or more optional types using the ? as shown below. TypeScript Interview Questions let values: [string, number, boolean?] = [""Foo"", 15];"
"37. Explain how tuple destructuring works in TypeScript. You can destructure tuple elements by using the assignment operator (=). The destructuring variables get the types of the corresponding tuple elements. let employeeRecord: [string, number] = [""John Doe"", 50000]; let [emp_name, emp_salary] = employeeRecord; console.log(`Name: ${emp_name}`); // ""Name: John Doe"" console.log(`Salary: ${emp_salary}`); // ""Salary: 50000"" A"
"38. What are type assertions in TypeScript? Sometimes, you as a programmer might know more about the type of a variable than TypeScript can infer. Usually, this happens when you know the type of an object is more specific than its current type. In such cases, you can tell the TypeScript compiler not to infer the type of the variable by using type assertions. TypeScript provides two forms to assert the types. as syntax: let value: unknown = ""Foo""; let len: number = (value as string).length; <> syntax: let value: unknown = ""Foo""; let len: number = (<string>value).length; TypeScript Interview Questions Type assertions are similar to typecasting in other programming languages such as C# or Java. However, unlike those languages, there’s no runtime penalty of boxing and unboxing variables to fit the types. Type assertions simply let the TypeScript compiler know the type of the variable."
"39. How to enforce strict null checks in TypeScript? Null pointers are one of the most common sources of unexpected runtime errors in programming. TypeScript helps you avoid them to a large degree by enforcing strict null checks. You can enforce strict null checks in two ways: providing the --strictNullChecks flag to the TypeScript (tsc) compiler setting the strictNullChecks property to true in the tsconfig.json configuration file. When the flag is false, TypeScript ignores null and undefined values in the code. When it is true, null and undefined have their distinct types. The compiler throws a type error if you try to use them where a concrete value is expected."
"40. How to make object properties immutable in TypeScript? (hint: readonly) You can mark object properties as immutable by using the readonly keyword before the property name. For example: interface Coordinate { readonly x: number; readonly y: number; } When you mark a property as readonly, it can only be set when you initialize the object. Once the object is created, you cannot change it. let c: Coordinate = { x: 5, y: 15 }; c.x = 20; // Cannot assign to 'x' because it is a read-only property.(2540) TypeScript Interview Questions"
"41. What is a type declaration file? A typical TypeScript project references other third-party TypeScript libraries such as JQuery to perform routine tasks. Having type information for the library code helps you in coding by providing detailed information about the types, method signatures, etc., and provides IntelliSense. A type declaration file is a text file ending with a .d.ts extension providing a way to declare the existence of some types or values without actually providing implementations for those values. It contains the type declarations but doesn’t have any source code. It doesn’t produce a .js file a"
"42. What are triple-slash directives? Triple-slash directives are single-line comments that contain a single XML tag. TypeScript uses this XML tag as a compiler directive. You can only place a triple-slash directive at the top of the containing file. Only single or multi-line comments can come before a triple-slash directive. TypeScript treats them as regular comments if it occurs in the middle of a code block, a"
"43. Explain the purpose of the ‘in’ operator. The in operator is used to find if a property is in the specified object. It returns true if the property belongs to the object. Otherwise, it returns false. const car = { make: 'Hyundai', model: 'Elantra', year: 2017 }; console.log('model' in car); // true console.log('test' in car); // false TypeScript Interview Questions"
"44. What are the ‘implements’ clauses in TypeScript? An implements clause is used to check that a class satisfies the contract specified by an interface. If a class implements an interface and doesn’t implement that interface, the TypeScript compiler issues an error. interface Runnable { run(): void; } class Job implements Runnable { run() { console.log(""running the scheduled job!""); } } // Class 'Task' incorrectly implements interface 'Runnable'. // Property 'run' is missing in type 'Task' but required in type 'Runnable'.(2420) class Task implements Runnable { perform() { console.log(""pong!""); } } A class can implement more than one interface. In this case, the class has to specify all the contracts of those interfaces."
"45. What are string literal types? In TypeScript, you can refer to specific strings and numbers as types. let foo: ""bar"" = ""bar""; // OK foo = ""bar""; // Error: Type '""baz""' is not assignable to type '""bar""'.(2322) foo = ""baz""; String literal types on their own are not that useful. However, you can combine them into unions. This allows you to specify all the string values that a variable can take, in turn acting like enums. This can be useful for function parameters. TypeScript Interview Questions String literal types can help us spell-check the string values."
"46. What are template literal types? Template literal types are similar to the string literal types. You can combine them with concrete, literal types to produce a new string literal type. Template literal types allow us to use the string literal types as building blocks to create new string literal types. type Point = ""GraphPoint""; // type Shape = ""Grid GraphPoint"" type Shape = `Grid ${Point}`; Template literal types can also expand into multiple strings via unions. It helps us create the set of every possible string literal that each union member can represent. type Color = ""green"" | ""yellow""; type Quantity = ""five"" | ""six""; // type ItemTwo = ""five item"" | ""six item"" | ""green item"" | ""yellow item"" type ItemOne = `${Quantity | Color} item`;"
"47. Explain the concept of inheritance in TypeScript. Inheritance allows a class to extend another class and reuse and modify the behavior defined in the other class. The class which inherits another class is called the derived class, and the class getting inherited is called the base class. In TypeScript, a class can only extend one class. TypeScript uses the keyword ‘extends’ to specify the relationship between the base class and the derived classes. function greet(name: string, greeting: ""hi"" | ""hello"" | ""hola"") { // ... } greet(""John"", ""hello""); // Error: Argument of type '""Howdy?""' is not assignable to parameter of type '""hi"" | ""h greet(""Mary"", ""Howdy?""); TypeScript Interview Questions class Rectangle { length: number; breadth: number constructor(length: number, breadth: number) { this.length = length; this.breadth = breadth } area(): number { return this.length * this.breadth; } } class Square extends Rectangle { constructor(side: number) { super(side, side); } volume() { return ""Square doesn't have a volume!"" } } const sq = new Square(10); console.log(sq.area()); // 100 console.log(sq.volume()); // ""Square doesn't have a volume!"" In the above example, because the class Square extends functionality from Rectangle, we can create an instance of square and call both the area() and volume() methods."
"48. What are conditional types? How do you create them? A conditional type allows you to dynamically select one of two possible types based on a condition. The condition is expressed as a type relationship test. C extends B ? TypeX : TypeY Here, if type C extends B, the value of the above type is TypeX. Otherwise, it is TypeY."
"49. What is the Function type in TypeScript? TypeScript Interview Questions Function is a global type in TypeScript. It has properties like bind, call, and apply, along with the other properties present on all function values. function perform(fn: Function) { fn(10); } You can always call a value of the Function type, and it returns a value of ‘any’ type."
"50. List some of the utility types provided by TypeScript and explain their usage. TypeScript provides various utility types that make common type transformations easy. These utility types are available globally. Here are some of the essential utility types included in TypeScript. Utility Type Description Partial<Type>Constructs a type with all properties of Type set to optional. Required<Type>Constructs a type consisting of all properties of Type set to required. Readonly<Type> Constructs a type with all properties of Type set to readonly. Record<Keys, Type>Constructs an object type with property keys are of type Keys, and values are Type. "
"Data Science Interview Questions Over the years, data science has gained widespread importance due to the importance of data. Data is considered as the new oil of the future which when analyzed and harnessed properly can prove to be very beneficial to the stakeholders. Not just this, a data scientist gets the exposure to work in diverse domains, solving real-life practical problems all by making use of trendy technologies. The most common real-time application is fast delivery of food in apps such as Uber Eats by aiding the delivery person shows the fastest possible route to reach the destination from the restaurant. Data Science is also used in item recommendation systems in e- commerce sites like Amazon, Flipkart, etc which recommends the user what item they can buy based on their search history. Not just recommendation systems, Data Science is becoming increasingly popular in fraud detection applications to detect any fraud involved in credit-based financial applications. A successful data scientist can interpret data, perform innovation and bring out creativity while solving problems that help drive business and strategic goals. This makes it the most lucrative job of the 21st century. Learn More. In this article, we will explore what are the most commonly asked interview questions which will help both aspiring and experienced data scientists. Data Science Interview Questions for Freshers"
"1. What does one understand by the term Data Science? An interdisciplinary field that constitutes various scientific processes, algorithms, tools, and machine learning techniques working to help find common patterns and gather sensible insights from the given raw input data using statistical and mathematical analysis is called Data Science. The following figure represents the life cycle of data science. Data Science Interview Questions It starts with gathering the business requirements and relevant data. Once the data is acquired, it is maintained by performing data cleaning, data warehousing, data staging, and data architecture. Data processing does the task of exploring the data, mining it, analyzing it which can be finally used to generate the summary of the insights extracted from the data. Once the exploratory steps are completed, the cleansed data is subjected to various algorithms like predictive analysis, regression, text mining, recognition patterns, etc depending on the requirements. In the final stage, the results are communicated to the business in a visually appealing manner. This is where the skill of data visualization, reporting, and diﬀerent business intelligence tools come into the picture."
2. What is the diﬀerence between data analytics and data science? Data Science Interview Questions Data science involves the task of transforming data by using various technical analysis methods to extract meaningful insights using which a data analyst can apply to their business scenarios. Data analytics deals with checking the existing hypothesis and information and answers questions for a better and eﬀective business-related decision-making process. Data Science drives innovation by answering questions that build connections and answers for futuristic problems. Data analytics focuses on getting present meaning from existing historical context whereas data science focuses on predictive modeling. Data Science can be considered as a broad subject that makes use of various mathematical and scientific tools and algorithms for solving complex problems whereas data analytics can be considered as a specific field dealing with specific concentrated problems using fewer tools of statistics and visualization. The following Venn diagram depicts the diﬀerence between data science and analytics clearly:
"3. What are some of the techniques used for sampling? What is the main advantage of sampling? Data Science Interview Questions Data analysis can not be done on a whole volume of data at a time especially when it involves larger datasets. It becomes crucial to take some data samples that can be used for representing the whole population and then perform analysis on it. While doing this, it is very much necessary to carefully take sample data out of the huge data that truly represents the entire dataset. There are majorly two categories of sampling techniques based on the usage of statistics, they are: Probability Sampling techniques: Clustered sampling, Simple random sampling, Stratified sampling. Non-Probability Sampling techniques: Quota sampling, Convenience sampling, snowball sampling, etc."
"4. List down the conditions for Overfitting and Underfitting. Overfitting: The model performs well only for the sample training data. If any new data is given as input to the model, it fails to provide any result. These conditions occur due to low bias and high variance in the model. Decision trees are more prone to overfitting. Data Science Interview Questions Underfitting: Here, the model is so simple that it is not able to identify the correct relationship in the data, and hence it does not perform well even on the test data. This can happen due to high bias and low variance. Linear regression is more prone to Underfitting. Data Science Interview Questions"
"5. Diﬀerentiate between the long and wide format data. Long format Data Wide-Format Data Here, each row of the data represents the one-time information of a subject. Each subject would have its data in diﬀerent/ multiple rows.Here, the repeated responses of a subject are part of separate columns. The data can be recognized by considering rows as groups.The data can be recognized by considering columns as groups. This data format is most commonly used in R analyses and to write into log files a"
6. What are Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues? Eigenvectors are column vectors or unit vectors whose length/magnitude is equal to
1. They are also called right vectors. Eigenvalues are coeﬀicients that are applied on eigenvectors which give these vectors diﬀerent values for length or magnitude. Data Science Interview Questions A matrix can be decomposed into Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues and this process is called Eigen decomposition. These are then eventually used in machine learning methods like PCA (Principal Component Analysis) for gathering valuable insights from the given matrix.
"7. What does it mean when the p-values are high and low? A p-value is the measure of the probability of having results equal to or more than the results achieved under a specific hypothesis assuming that the null hypothesis is correct. This represents the probability that the observed diﬀerence occurred randomly by chance. Low p-value which means values ≤ 0.05 means that the null hypothesis can be rejected and the data is unlikely with true null. High p-value, i.e values ≥ 0.05 indicates the strength in favor of the null hypothesis. It means that the data is like with true null. p-value = 0.05 means that the hypothesis can go either way."
8. When is resampling done? Resampling is a methodology used to sample data for improving accuracy and quantify the uncertainty of population parameters. It is done to ensure the model is good enough by training the model on diﬀerent patterns of a dataset to ensure variations are handled. It is also done in the cases where models need to be validated using random subsets or when substituting labels on data points while performing tests.
9. What do you understand by Imbalanced Data? Data is said to be highly imbalanced if it is distributed unequally across diﬀerent categories. These datasets result in an error in model performance and result in inaccuracy.
"10. Are there any diﬀerences between the expected value and mean value? Data Science Interview Questions There are not many diﬀerences between these two, but it is to be noted that these are used in diﬀerent contexts. The mean value generally refers to the probability distribution whereas the expected value is referred to in the contexts involving random variables."
11. What do you understand by Survivorship Bias? This bias refers to the logical error while focusing on aspects that survived some process and overlooking those that did not work due to lack of prominence. This bias can lead to deriving wrong conclusions.
"12. Define the terms KPI, li"
13. Define confounding variables. Confounding variables are also known as confounders. These variables are a type of extraneous variables that influence both independent and dependent variables causing spurious association and mathematical relationships between those variables that are associated but are not casually related to each other. Data Science Interview Questions for Experienced Data Science Interview Questions
"14. How are the time series problems diﬀerent from other regression problems? Time series data can be thought of as an extension to linear regression which uses terms like autocorrelation, movement of averages for summarizing historical data of y-axis variables for predicting a better future. Forecasting and prediction is the main goal of time series problems where accurate predictions can be made but sometimes the underlying reasons might not be known. Having Time in the problem does not necessarily mean it becomes a time series problem. There should be a relationship between target and time for a problem to become a time series problem. The observations close to one another in time are expected to be similar to the ones far away which provide accountability for seasonality. For instance, today’s weather would be similar to tomorrow’s weather but not similar to weather from 4 months from today. Hence, weather prediction based on past data becomes a time series problem."
"15. Suppose there is a dataset having variables with missing values of more than 30%, how will you deal with such a dataset? Depending on the size of the dataset, we follow the below ways: In case the datasets are small, the missing values are substituted with the mean or average of the remaining data. In pandas, this can be done by using mean = df.mean() where df represents the pandas dataframe representing the dataset and mean() calculates the mean of the data. To substitute the missing values with the calculated mean, we can use df.fillna(mean). For larger datasets, the rows with missing values can be removed and the remaining data can be used for data prediction."
"16. What is Cross-Validation? Data Science Interview Questions Cross-Validation is a Statistical technique used for improving a model’s performance. Here, the model will be trained and tested with rotation using diﬀerent samples of the training dataset to ensure that the model performs well for unknown data. The training data will be split into various groups and the model is run and validated against these groups in rotation. The most commonly used techniques are: K- Fold method Leave p-out method Leave-one-out method Holdout method"
"17. What are the diﬀerences between correlation and covariance? Although these two terms are used for establishing a relationship and dependency between any two random variables, the following are the diﬀerences between them: Data Science Interview Questions Correlation: This technique is used to measure and estimate the quantitative relationship between two variables and is measured in terms of how strong are the variables related. Covariance: It represents the extent to which the variables change together in a cycle. This explains the systematic relationship between pair of variables where changes in one aﬀect changes in another variable. Mathematically, consider 2 random variables, X and Y where the means are represented as μX and μY respectively and standard deviations are represented by σX and σY respectively and E represents the expected value operator, then: covarianceXY = E[(X-μX),(Y-μY)] correlationXY = E[(X-μX),(Y-μY)]/(σXσY) so that correlation(X,Y) = covariance(X,Y)/(covariance(X) covariance(Y)) Based on the above formula, we can deduce that the correlation is dimensionless whereas covariance is represented in units that are obtained from the multiplication of units of two variables. The following image graphically shows the diﬀerence between correlation and covariance: Data Science Interview Questions"
"18. How do you approach solving any data analytics based project? Generally, we follow the below steps: First step is to thoroughly understand the business requirement/problem Next, explore the given data and analyze it carefully. If you find any data missing, get the requirements clarified from the business. Data cleanup and preparation step is to be performed next which is then used for modeling. Here, the missing values are found and the variables are transformed. Run your model against the data, build meaningful visualization and analyze the results to get meaningful insights. Release the model implementation, track the results and performance over a specified period to analyze the usefulness. Perform cross-validation of the model. Data Science Interview Questions"
"19. Why do we need selection bias? Selection Bias happens in cases where there is no randomization specifically achieved while picking a part of the dataset for analysis. This bias tells that the sample analyzed does not represent the whole population meant to be analyzed. For example, in the below image, we can see that the sample that we selected does not entirely represent the whole population that we have. This helps us to question whether we have selected the right data for analysis or not. Data Science Interview Questions"
"20. Why is data cleaning crucial? How do you clean the data? While running an algorithm on any data, to gather proper insights, it is very much necessary to have correct and clean data that contains only relevant information. Dirty data most o"
"21. What are the available feature selection methods for selecting the right variables for building eﬀicient predictive models? Data Science Interview Questions While using a dataset in data science or machine learning algorithms, it so happens that not all the variables are necessary and useful to build a model. Smarter feature selection methods are required to avoid redundant models to increase the eﬀiciency of our model. Following are the three main methods in feature selection: Filter Methods: These methods pick up only the intrinsic properties of features that are measured via univariate statistics and not cross-validated performance. They are straightforward and are generally faster and require less computational resources when compared to wrapper methods. There are various filter methods such as the Chi-Square test, Fisher’s Score method, Correlation Coeﬀicient, Variance Threshold, Mean Absolute Diﬀerence (MAD) method, Dispersion Ratios, etc. Data Science Interview Questions Wrapper Methods: These methods need some sort of method to search greedily on all possible feature subsets, access their quality by learning and evaluating a classifier with the feature. The selection technique is built upon the machine learning algorithm on which the given dataset needs to fit. There are three types of wrapper methods, they are: Forward Selection: Here, one feature is tested at a time and new features are added until a good fit is obtained. Backward Selection: Here, all the features are tested and the non- fitting ones are eliminated one by one to see while checking which works better. Recursive Feature Elimination: The features are recursively checked and evaluated how well they perform. These methods are generally computationally intensive and require high- end resources for analysis. But these methods usually lead to better predictive models having higher accuracy than filter methods. Data Science Interview Questions Embedded Methods: Embedded methods constitute the advantages of both filter and wrapper methods by including feature interactions while maintaining reasonable computational costs. These methods are iterative as they take each model iteration and carefully extract features contributing to most of the training in that iteration. Examples of embedded methods: LASSO Regularization (L1), Random Forest Importance."
"22. Will treating categorical variables as continuous variables result in a better predictive model? Yes! A categorical variable is a variable that can be assigned to two or more categories with no definite category ordering. Ordinal variables are similar to categorical variables with proper and clear ordering defines. So, if the variable is ordinal, then treating the categorical value as a continuous variable will result in better predictive models."
23. How will you treat missing values during data analysis? Data Science Interview Questions The impact of missing values can be known a
"24. What does the ROC Curve represent and how to create it? ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve is a graphical representation of the contrast between false-positive rates and true positive rates at diﬀerent thresholds. The curve is used as a proxy for a trade-oﬀ between sensitivity and specificity. The ROC curve is created by plotting values of true positive rates (TPR or sensitivity) against false-positive rates (FPR or (1-specificity)) TPR represents the proportion of observations correctly predicted as positive out of overall positive observations. The FPR represents the proportion of observations incorrectly predicted out of overall negative observations. Consider the example of medical testing, the TPR represents the rate at which people are correctly tested positive for a particular disease. Data Science Interview Questions"
"25. What are the diﬀerences between univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis? Statistical analyses are classified based on the number of variables processed at a given time. Data Science Interview Questions Univariate analysis Bivariate analysis Multivariate analysis This analysis deals with solving only one variable at a time.This analysis deals with the statistical study of two variables at a given time.This analysis deals with statistical analysis of more than two variables and studies the responses. Example: Sales pie charts based on territory.Example: Scatterplot of Sales and spend volume analysis study.Example: Study of the relationship between human’s social media habits and their self- esteem which depends on multiple factors like age, number of hours spent, employment status, relationship status, etc."
26. What is the diﬀerence between the Test set and validation set? The test set is used to test or evaluate the performance of the trained model. It evaluates the predictive power of the model. The validation set is part of the training set that is used to select parameters for avoiding model overfitting.
27. What do you understand by a kernel trick? Data Science Interview Questions Kernel functions are generalized dot product functions used for the computing dot product of vectors xx and yy in high dimensional feature space. Kernal trick method is used for solving a non-linear problem by using a linear classifier by transforming linearly inseparable data into separable ones in higher dimensions.
"28. Diﬀerentiate between box plot and histogram. Box plots and histograms are both visualizations used for showing data distributions for eﬀicient communication of information. Histograms are the bar chart representation of information that represents the frequency of numerical variable values that are useful in estimating probability distribution, variations and outliers. Boxplots are used for communicating diﬀerent aspects of data distribution where the shape of the distribution is not seen but still the insights can be gathered. These are useful for comparing multiple charts at the same time as they take less space when compared to histograms."
"29. How will you balance/correct imbalanced data? Data Science Interview Questions There are diﬀerent techniques to correct/balance imbalanced data. It can be done by increasing the sample numbers for minority classes. The number of samples can be decreased for those classes with extremely high data points. Following are some approaches followed to balance data: Use the right evaluation metrics: In cases of imbalanced data, it is very important to use the right evaluation metrics that provide valuable information. Specificity/Precision: Indicates the number of selected instances that are relevant. Sensitivity: Indicates the number of relevant instances that are selected. F1 score: It represents the harmonic mean of precision and sensitivity. MCC (Matthews correlation coeﬀicient): It represents the correlation coeﬀicient between observed and predicted binary classifications. AUC (Area Under the Curve): This represents a relation between the true positive rates and false-positive rates. For example, consider the below graph that illustrates training data: Here, if we measure the accuracy of the model in terms of getting ""0""s, then the accuracy of the model would be very high -> 99.9%, but the model does not guarantee any valuable information. In such cases, we can apply diﬀerent evaluation metrics as stated above. Data Science Interview Questions Training Set Resampling: It is also possible to balance data by working on getting diﬀerent datasets and this can be achieved by resampling. There are two approaches followed under-sampling that is used based on the use case and the requirements: Under-sampling This balances the data by reducing the size of the abundant class and is used when the data quantity is suﬀicient. By performing this, a new dataset that is balanced can be retrieved and this can be used for further modeling. Over-sampling This is used when data quantity is not suﬀicient. This method balances the dataset by trying to increase the samples size. Instead of getting rid of extra samples, new samples are generated and introduced by employing the methods of repetition, bootstrapping, etc. Perform K-fold cross-validation correctly: Cross-Validation needs to be applied properly while using over-sampling. The cross-validation should be done before over-sampling because if it is done later, then it would be like overfitting the model to get a specific result. To avoid this, resampling of data is done repeatedly with diﬀerent ratios."
"30. What is better - random forest or multiple decision trees? Data Science Interview Questions Random forest is better than multiple decision trees as random forests are much more robust, accurate, and lesser prone to overfitting as it is an ensemble method that ensures multiple weak decision trees learn strongly."
31. Consider a case where you know the probability of finding at least one shooting star in a 15-minute interval is 30%. Evaluate the probability of finding at least one shooting star in a one-hour duration? So the probability is 0.8628 = 86.28%
"32. Toss the selected coin 10 times from a jar of 1000 coins. Out of 1000 coins, 999 coins are fair and 1 coin is double-headed, assume that you see 10 heads. Estimate the probability of getting a head in the next coin toss. We know that there are two types of coins - fair and double-headed. Hence, there are two possible ways of choosing a coin. The first is to choose a fair coin and the second is to choose a coin having 2 heads. P(selecting fair coin) = 999/1000 = 0.999 P(selecting double headed coin) = 1/1000 = 0.001 Using Bayes rule, We know that, Probability of finding atleast 1 shooting star in 15 min = P(sighting in 15min) = 30% = Hence, Probability of not sighting any shooting star in 15 min = 1-P(sighting in 15min) = 1-0.3 = 0.7 Probability of not finding shooting star in 1 hour = 0.7^4 = 0.1372 Probability of finding atleast 1 shooting star in 1 hour = 1-0.1372 = 0.8628 Data Science Interview Questions So, the answer is 0.7531 or 75.3%."
"33. What are some examples when false positive has proven important than false negative? Before citing instances, let us understand what are false positives and false negatives. False Positives are those cases that were wrongly identified as an event even if they were not. They are called Type I errors. False Negatives are those cases that were wrongly identified as non-events despite being an event. They are called Type II errors. Some examples where false positives were important than false negatives are: P(selecting 10 heads in row) = P(selecting fair coin)* Getting 10 heads + P(selecting d P(selecting 10 heads in row) = P(A)+P(B) P (A) = 0.999 * (1/2)^10 = 0.999 * (1/1024) = 0.000976 P (B) = 0.001 * 1 = 0.001 P( A / (A + B) ) = 0.000976 / (0.000976 + 0.001) = 0.4939 P( B / (A + B)) = 0.001 / 0.001976 = 0.5061 P(selecting head in next toss) = P(A/A+B) * 0.5 + P(B/A+B) * 1 = 0.4939 * 0.5 + 0.5061 = 0.7531 Data Science Interview Questions In the medical field: Consider that a lab report has predicted cancer to a patient even if he did not have cancer. This is an example of a false positive error. It is dangerous to start chemotherapy for that patient as he doesn’t have cancer as starting chemotherapy would lead to damage of healthy cells and might even actually lead to cancer. In the e-commerce field: Suppose a company decides to start a campaign where they give $100 gi"
"34. Give one example where both false positives and false negatives are important equally? In Banking fields: Lending loans are the main sources of income to the banks. But if the repayment rate isn’t good, then there is a risk of huge losses instead of any profits. So giving out loans to customers is a gamble as banks can’t risk losing good customers but at the same time, they can’t aﬀord to acquire bad customers. This case is a classic example of equal importance in false positive and false negative scenarios."
35. Is it good to do dimensionality reduction before fitting a Support Vector Model? If the features number is greater than observations then doing dimensionality reduction improves the SVM (Support Vector Model).
36. What are various assumptions used in linear regression? What would happen if they are violated? Linear regression is done under the following assumptions: Data Science Interview Questions The sample data used for modeling represents the entire population. There exists a linear relationship between the X-axis variable and the mean of the Y variable. The residual variance is the same for any X values. This is called homoscedasticity The observations are independent of one another. Y is distributed normally for any value of X. Extreme violations of the above assumptions lead to redundant results. Smaller violations of these result in greater variance or bias of the estimates.
"37. How is feature selection performed using the regularization method? The method of regularization entails the addition of penalties to diﬀerent parameters in the machine learning model for reducing the freedom of the model to avoid the issue of overfitting. There are various regularization methods available such as linear model regularization, Lasso/L1 regularization, etc. The linear model regularization applies penalty over coeﬀicients that multiplies the predictors. The Lasso/L1 regularization has the feature of shrinking some coeﬀicients to zero, thereby making it eligible to be removed from the model."
"38. How do you identify if a coin is biased? To identify this, we perform a hypothesis test as below: According to the null hypothesis, the coin is unbiased if the probability of head flipping is 50%. According to the alternative hypothesis, the coin is biased and the probability is not equal to 500. Perform the below steps: Flip coin 500 times Calculate p-value. Compare the p-value against the alpha -> result of two-tailed test (0.05/2 = 0.025). Following two cases might occur: p-value > alpha: Then null hypothesis holds good and the coin is unbiased. p-value < alpha: Then the null hypothesis is rejected and the coin is biased. Data Science Interview Questions"
39. What is the importance of dimensionality reduction? The process of dimensionality reduction constitutes reducing the number of features in a dataset to avoid overfitting and reduce the variance. There are mostly 4 advantages of this process: This reduces the storage space and time for model execution. Removes the issue of multi-collinearity thereby improving the parameter interpretation of the ML model. Makes it easier for visualizing data when the dimensions are reduced. Avoids the curse of increased dimensionality.
"Algorithm Interview Questions Now, the very first question which must be popping in your head must be ""What is an algorithm?"" Well, the answer to this question is: An algorithm is a finite sequence of well-defined instructions used to solve a class of problems or conduct a computation in mathematics and computer science. Algorithms are used to specify how calculations, data processing, automated reasoning, automated decision making, and other tasks should be done. An algorithm is a method for calculating a function that can be represented in a finite amount of space and time and in a well defined formal language. The instructions describe a computation that, when run, continues through a finite number of well defined subsequent stages, finally creating ""output"" and terminating at a final ending state, starting from an initial state and initial input (possibly empty). The shi"
"1. How can we compare between two algorithms written for the same problem? Algorithm Interview Questions The complexity of an algorithm is a technique that is used to categorise how eﬀicient it is in comparison to other algorithms. It focuses on how the size of the data set to be processed aﬀects execution time. In computing, the algorithm's computational complexity is critical. It is a good idea to categorise algorithms according to how much time or space they take up and to describe how much time or space they take up as a function of input size. Complexity of Time: The running time of a program as a function of the size of the input is known as time complexity. Complexity of Space: Space complexity examines algorithms based on how much space they require to fulfil their tasks. In the early days of computers, space complexity analysis was crucial (when storage space on the computer was limited). Note: Nowadays, a lack of space is rarely an issue because computer storage is plentiful. Therefore, it is mostly the Time Complexity that is given more importance while evaluating an Algorithm."
"2. What do you understand by the best case, worst case and average case scenario of an algorithm? The mathematical foundation/framing of an algorithm's run time performance is defined by asymptotic analysis. We can easily determine the best case, average case, and worst-case scenarios of an algorithm using asymptotic analysis. Algorithm Interview Questions Best Case Scenario of an Algorithm: The best-case scenario for an algorithm is defined as the data arrangement in which the algorithm performs the best. Take a binary search, for example, where the best-case scenario is if the target value is in the very centre of the data we are looking for. The best-case scenario for binary search would have a time complexity of O(1) or constant time complexity. Worst Case Scenario of an Algorithm: The worst collection of input for a given algorithm is referred to as the worst-case scenario of an Algorithm. For example, quicksort can perform poorly if the pivot value is set to the largest or smallest element of a sublist. Quicksort will degenerate into an algorithm with a time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the size of the list to be sorted. Average Case Scenario of an Algorithm: The average-case complexity of an algorithm is the amount of some computational resource (usually time) used by the process, averaged over all possible inputs, according to computational complexity theory. For example, the average-case complexity of the randomised quicksort algorithm is O(n*log(n)), where n is the size of the list to be sorted."
"3. What do you understand by the Asymptotic Notations? Asymptotic analysis is a technique that is used for determining the eﬀiciency of an algorithm that does not rely on machine-specific constants and avoids the algorithm from comparing itself to the time-consuming approach. For asymptotic analysis, asymptotic notation is a mathematical technique that is used to indicate the temporal complexity of algorithms. The following are the three most common asymptotic notations. Big Theta Notation: (θ Notation) The exact asymptotic behaviour is defined using the theta (θ) Notation. It binds functions from above and below to define behaviour. Dropping low order terms and ignoring leading constants is a convenient approach to get Theta notation for an expression. Algorithm Interview Questions Big O Notation: The Big O notation defines an upper bound for an algorithm by bounding a function from above. Consider the situation of insertion sort: in the best case scenario, it takes linear time, and in the worst case, it takes quadratic time. Insertion sort has a time complexity O(n^2). It is useful when we just have an upper constraint on an algorithm's time complexity. Algorithm Interview Questions Big Omega (Ω) Notation: The Ω Notation provides an asymptotic lower bound on a function, just like Big O notation does. It is useful when we have a lower bound on an algorithm's time complexity. Algorithm Interview Questions"
"4. Write an algorithm to swap two given numbers in Java without using a temporary variable. It is a trick question that is frequently asked in the interviews of various companies. This problem can be solved in a variety of ways. However, while solving the problem, we must solve it without using a temporary variable, which is an essential condition. For this problem, if we can consider the possibility of integer overflow in our solution while coming up with an approach to solving it, we can make a great impression on interviewers. Let us say that we have two integers a and b, with a's value equal to 5 and a's value equal to 6, and we want to swap them without needing a third variable. We will need to use Java programming constructs to solve this problem. Mathematical procedures such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division can be used to swap numbers. However, it is possible that it will cause an integer overflow problem. Let us take a look at two approaches to solve this problem: Using Addition and subtraction: a = a + b; b = a - b; // this will act like (a+b) - b, and now b equals a. a = a - b; // this will act like (a+b) - a, and now an equals b. It is a clever trick. However, if the addition exceeds the maximum value of the int primitive type as defined by Integer.MAX_VALUE in Java, or if the subtraction is less than the minimum value of the int primitive type as defined by Integer.MIN_VALUE in Java, there will be an integer overflow. Using the XOR method: Another way to swap two integers without needing a third variable (temporary variable) is using the XOR method. This is o"
"5. Explain the Divide and Conquer Algorithmic Paradigm. Also list a few algorithms which use this paradigm. Divide and Conquer is an algorithm paradigm, not an algorithm itself. It is set up in such a way that it can handle a large amount of data, split it down into smaller chunks, and determine the solution to the problem for each of the smaller chunks. It combines all of the piecewise solutions of the smaller chunks to form a single global solution. This is known as the divide and conquer technique. The Divide and Conquer algorithmic paradigm employ the steps given below: Divide: The algorithm separates the original problem into a set of subproblems in this step. Conquer: The algorithm solves each subproblem individually in this step. Combine: In this step, the algorithm combines the solutions to the subproblems to obtain the overall solution. Algorithm Interview Questions Some of the algorithms which use the Divide and Conquer Algorithmic paradigm are as follows: Binary Search Merge Sort Strassen's Matrix Multiplication Quick Sort Closest pair of points."
"6. What do you understand about greedy algorithms? List a few examples of greedy algorithms. A greedy algorithm is an algorithmic method that aims to choose the best optimal decision at each sub-step, eventually leading to a globally optimal solution. This means that the algorithm chooses the best answer available at the time, regardless of the consequences. In other words, when looking for an answer, an algorithm always selects the best immediate, or local, option. Greedy algorithms may identify less than perfect answers for some cases of other problems while finding the overall, ideal solution for some idealistic problems. The Greedy algorithm is used in the following algorithms to find their solutions: Prim's Minimal Spanning Tree Algorithm Kruskal's Minimal Spanning Tree Algorithm Travelling Salesman Problem Fractional Knapsack Problem Dijkstra's Algorithm Job Scheduling Problem Graph Map Coloring Graph Vertex Cover."
"7. What do you understand by a searching algorithm? List a few types of searching algorithms. Algorithm Interview Questions Searching Algorithms are used to look for an element or get it from a data structure (usually a list of elements). These algorithms are divided into two categories based on the type of search operation: Sequential Search: This method traverses the list of elements consecutively, checking each element and reporting if the element to be searched is found. Linear Search is an example of a Sequential Search Algorithm. Interval Search: These algorithms were created specifically for searching sorted data structures. Because they continually target the centre of the search structure and divide the search space in half, these types of search algorithms are far more eﬀicient than Sequential Search algorithms. Binary Search is an example of an Interval Search Algorithm."
"8. Describe the Linear Search Algorithm. To find an element in a group of elements, the linear search can be used. It works by traversing the list of elements from the beginning to the end and inspecting the properties of all the elements encountered along the way. Let us consider the case of an array containing some integer elements. We want to find out and print all of the elements' positions that match a particular value (also known as the ""key"" for the linear search). The linear search works in a flow here, matching each element with the number from the beginning to the end of the list, and then printing the element's location if the element at that position is equal to the key. Given below is an algorithm describing Linear Search: Step 1: Using a loop, traverse the list of elements given. Step 2: In each iteration, compare the target value (or key-value) to the list's current value. Step 3: If the values match, print the array's current index. Step 4: Move on to the next array element if the values do not match. Step 5: Repeat Steps 1 to 4 till the end of the list of elements is reached. Algorithm Interview Questions The time complexity of the Linear Search Algorithm is O(n) where n is the size of the list of elements and its space complexity is constant, that is, O(1)."
"9. Describe the Binary Search Algorithm. To apply binary search on a list of elements, the prerequisite is that the list of elements should be sorted. It is based on the Divide and Conquers Algorithmic paradigm. In the Binary Search Algorithm, we divide the search interval in half periodically to search the sorted list. We begin by creating an interval that spans the entire list. If the search key's value is less than the item in the interval's midpoint, the interval should be narrowed to the lower half. Otherwise, we limit it to the upper half of the page. We check for the value until it is discovered or the interval is empty. Given below is an algorithm describing Binary Search: (Let us assume that the element to be searched is x and the array of elements is sorted in ascending order) Algorithm Interview Questions Step 1: x should be firstly compared to the middle element. Step 2: We return the middle element's index if x matches the middle element. Step 3: Else If x is greater than the middle element, x can only be found a"

An algorithm for adding a node to a link list sorted in ascending order (maintaining the sorting property) is given below: Step 1: Check if the linked list has no value (or is empty). If yes, then set the new node as the head and return it. Step 2: Check if the value of the node to be inserted is smaller than the value of the head node. If yes, place it at the beginning and make it the head node. Step 3: Find the suitable node a"

"12. What do you understand about the Dynamic Programming (DP) Algorithmic Paradigm? List a few problems which can be solved using the same. Dynamic Programming is primarily a recursion optimization. We can use Dynamic Programming to optimise any recursive solution that involves repeated calls for the same inputs. The goal is to simply save the results of subproblems so that we do not have to recalculate them later. The time complexity of this simple optimization is reduced from exponential to polynomial. For example, if we create a simple recursive solution for Fibonacci Numbers, the time complexity is exponential, but if we optimise it by storing subproblem answers using Dynamic Programming, the time complexity is linear. The following codes illustrate the same: Algorithm Interview Questions With Recursion (no DP): The time complexity of the given code will be exponential. /*Sample C++ code for finding nth fibonacci number without DP*/ int nFibonacci(int n){ if(n == 0 || n == 1) return n; else return nFibonacci(n - 1) + nFibonacci(n - 2); } With DP: The time complexity of the given code will be linear because of Dynamic Programming. /*Sample C++ code for finding nth fibonacci number with DP*/ int nFibonacci(int n){ vector<int> fib(n + 1); fib[0] = 0; fib[1] = 1; for(int i = 2;i <= n;i ++){ fib[i] = fib[i - 1] + fib[i - 2]; } return fib[n]; } A few problems which can be solved using the Dynamic Programming (DP) Algorithmic Paradigm are as follows: Finding the nth Fibonacci number Finding the Longest Common Subsequence between two strings. Finding the Longest Palindromic Substring in a string. The discrete (or 0-1) Knapsack Problem. Shortest Path between any two nodes in a graph (Floyd Warshall Algorithm)"
"13. Write down a string reversal algorithm. If the given string is ""kitiR,"" for example, the output should be ""Ritik"". An algorithm for string reversal is as follows: Algorithm Interview Questions Step 1: Start. Step 2: We take two variables l and r. Step 3: We set the values of l as 0 and r as (length of the string - 1). Step 4: We interchange the values of the characters at positions l and r in the string. Step 5: We increment the value of l by one. Step 6: We decrement the value of r by one. Step 7: If the value of r is greater than the value of l, we go to step 4 Step 8: Stop."
"14. What do you understand about the BFS (Breadth First Search) algorithm. BFS or Breadth-First Search is a graph traversal technique. It begins by traversing the graph from the root node and explores all of the nodes in the immediate vicinity. It chooses the closest node and then visits all of the nodes that have yet to be visited. Until it reaches the objective node, the algorithm repeats the same method for each of the closest nodes. The BFS Algorithm is given below: Step 1: Set status = 1 as the first step for all the nodes(ready state). Step 2: Set the status of the initial node A to 2, that is, waiting state. Step 3: Repeat steps 4 and 5 until the queue is not empty. Step 4: Dequeue and process node N from the queue, setting its status to 3, that is, the processed state. Step 5: Put all of N's neighbours in the ready state (status = 1) in the queue and set their status to 2 (waiting state) Step 6: Exit."
"15. What do you understand about the DFS (Depth First Search) algorithm. Algorithm Interview Questions Depth First Search or DFS is a technique for traversing or exploring data structures such as trees and graphs. The algorithm starts at the root node (in the case of a graph, any random node can be used as the root node) and examines each branch as far as feasible before retracing. So the basic idea is to start at the root or any arbitrary node and mark it, then advance to the next unmarked node and repeat until there are no more unmarked nodes. A"
"16. How do the encryption algorithms work? e process of transforming plaintext into a secret code format known as ""Ciphertext'' is known as encryption. For calculations, this technique uses a string of bits known as ""keys"" to convert the text. The larger the key, the more potential patterns for producing ciphertext there are. The majority of encryption algorithms use fixed blocks of input with lengths ranging from 64 to 128 bits, while others use the stream technique."
17. What are few of the most widely used cryptographic algorithms? A few of the most widely used cryptographic algorithms are as follows: Algorithm Interview Questions IDEA CAST CMEA 3-way Blowfish GOST LOKI DES and Triple DES.
"18. Describe the merge sort algorithm. Merge sort (also known as mergesort) is a general-purpose, comparison-based sorting algorithm developed in computer science. The majority of its implementations result in a stable sort, which indicates that the order of equal elements in the input and output is the same. In 1945, John von Neumann devised the merge sort method, which is a divide and conquer algorithm. The following is how a merge sort works conceptually: Separate the unsorted list into n sublists, each with one element (a list of one element is considered sorted). Merge sublists repeatedly to create new sorted sublists until only one sublist remains. The sorted list will be displayed then. The time complexity of the Merge Sort Algorithm is O(nlog(n)) where n is the size of the list of the elements to be sorted while the space complexity of the Merge Sort Algorithm is O(n), that is, linear space complexity.

"19. Describe the quick sort algorithm. Quicksort is a sorting algorithm that is in place (in-place algorithm is an algorithm that transforms input using no auxiliary data structure). It was created by the British computer scientist Tony Hoare in 1959 and was published in 1961, and it is still a popular sorting algorithm. It can be somewhat quicker than merge sort and two or three times faster than heapsort when properly done. Quicksort is based on the divide and conquer algorithmic paradigm. It operates by picking a 'pivot' element from the array and separating the other elements into two subarrays based on whether they are greater or less than the pivot. As a result, it is also known as partition exchange sort. The subarrays are then recursively sorted. This can be done in place, with only a little amount of additional RAM (Random Access Memory) required for sorting. Algorithm Interview Questions Quicksort is a comparison sorting algorithm, which means it can sort objects of any type that have a ""less-than"" relation (technically, a total order) declared for them. Quicksort is not a stable sort, which means that the relative order of equal sort items is not retained in eﬀicient implementations. Quicksort (like the partition method) must be written in such a way that it can be called for a range within a bigger array, even if the end purpose is to sort the entire array, due to its recursive nature. The following are the steps for in-place quicksort: If there are less than two elements in the range, return immediately because there is nothing else to do. A special-purpose sorting algorithm may be used for other very small lengths, and the rest of these stages may be avoided. Otherwise, choose a pivot value, which is a value that occurs in the range (the precise manner of choice depends on the partition routine, and can involve randomness). Partition the range by reordering its elements while determining a point of division so that all elements with values less than the pivot appear before the division and all elements with values greater than the pivot appear a"
"20. Describe the bubble sort algorithm with the help of an example. Bubble sort, also known as sinking sort, is a basic sorting algorithm that iterates through a list, comparing neighbouring elements and swapping them if they are out of order. The list is sent through again and again until it is sorted. The comparison sort method is named from the manner that smaller or larger components ""bubble"" to the top of the list. This simplistic method performs badly in real-world situations and is mostly used as a teaching aid. Let us take an example to understand how bubble sort works: Let us assume that the array to be sorted is (50 10 40 20 80). The various passes or rounds of bubble sort are given below: Algorithm Interview Questions First Pass: (50 10 40 20 80) –> ( 10 50 40 20 80 ), Since 50 > 10, the algorithm compares the first two elements and swaps them. ( 10 50 40 20 80 ) –> ( 10 40 50 20 80 ), Since 50 > 40, the algorithm swaps the values at the second and third positions. (10 40 50 20 80) –> (10 40 20 50 80), Since 50 > 3, the algorithm swaps the third and fourth elements. (10 40 20 50 80) -> ( 10 40 20 50 80 ), The method does not swap the fourth and fi"

"22. Explain the Dijkstra's Algorithm to find the shortest path between a given node in a graph to any other node in the graph. Algorithm Interview Questions Dijkstra's algorithm is a method for determining the shortest pathways between nodes in a graph, which might be used to depict road networks. Edsger W. Dijkstra, a computer scientist, conceived it in 1956 and published it three years later. There are numerous variations of the algorithm. The original Dijkstra algorithm discovered the shortest path between two nodes, but a more frequent form fixes a single node as the ""source"" node and finds the shortest pathways from the source to all other nodes in the network, resulting in a shortest-path tree. Let us take a look at Dijkstra's Algorithm to find the shortest path between a given node in a graph to any other node in the graph: Let us call the node where we are starting the process as the initial node. Let the distance from the initial node to Y be the distance of node Y. Dijkstra's algorithm will begin with unlimited distances and attempt to improve them incrementally. Algorithm Interview Questions Step 1: Mark all nodes that have not been visited yet. The unvisited set is a collection of all the nodes that have not been visited yet. Step 2: Assign a tentative distance value to each node: set it to zero for our first node and infinity for all others. The length of the shortest path discovered so far between the node v and the initial node is the tentative distance of a node v. Because no other vertex other than the source (which is a path of length zero) is known at the start, all other tentative distances are set to infinity. Set the current node to the beginning node. Step 3: Consider all of the current node's unvisited neighbours and determine their approximate distances through the current node. Compare the newly calculated tentative distance to the current assigned value and choose the one that is less. If the present node A has a distance of 5 and the edge linking it to a neighbour B has a length of 3, the distance to B through A will be 5 +3 = 8. Change B to 8 if it was previously marked with a distance greater than 8. If this is not the case, the current value will be retained. Step 4: Mark the current node as visited and remove it from the unvisited set once we have considered all of the current node's unvisited neighbours. A node that has been visited will never be checked again. Stop if the destination node has been marked visited (when planning a route between two specific nodes) or if the smallest tentative distance between the nodes in the unvisited set is infinity (when planning a complete traversal; occurs when there is no connection between the initial node and the remaining unvisited nodes). The algorithm is now complete. Step 5: Otherwise, return to step 3 and select the unvisited node indicated with the shortest tentative distance as the new current node. Algorithm Interview Questions It is not required to wait until the target node is ""visited"" as described above while constructing a route: the algorithm can end once the destination node has the least tentative distance among all ""unvisited"" nodes (and thus could be selected as the next ""current""). For arbitrary directed graphs with unbounded non-negative weights, Dijkstra's algorithm is asymptotically the fastest known single-source shortest path algorithm with time complexity of O(|E| + |V|log(|V|)), where |V| is the number of nodes and|E| is the number of edges in the graph."
"23. Can we use the binary search algorithm for linked lists? Justify your answer. No, we cannot use the binary search algorithm for linked lists. Explanation: Because random access is not allowed in linked lists, reaching the middle element in constant or O(1) time is impossible. As a result, the usage of a binary search algorithm on a linked list is not possible."
24. What are recursive algorithms? State the important rules which every recursive algorithm must follow. Recursive algorithm is a way of tackling a diﬀicult problem by breaking it down into smaller and smaller subproblems until the problem is small enough to be solved quickly. It usually involves a function that calls itself (property of recursive functions). The three laws which must be followed by all recursive algorithms are as follows: Algorithm Interview Questions There should be a base case. It is necessary for a recursive algorithm to call itself. The state of a recursive algorithm must be changed in order for it to return to the base case.
25. Devise an algorithm to insert a node in a Binary Search Tree. An algorithm to insert a node in a Binary Search Tree is given below: Assign the current node to the root node. If the root node's value is greater than the value that has to be added: If the root node has a le

27. Define tree traversal and list some of the algorithms to traverse a binary tree. The process of visiting all the nodes of a tree is known as tree traversal. Some of the algorithms to traverse a binary tree are as follows: Pre-order Traversal. In order Traversal. Post order Traversal. Breadth First Search ZigZag Traversal.
"28. Describe the heap sort algorithm. Heap sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm. Heapsort is similar to selection sort in that it separates its input into a sorted and an unsorted region, then successively decreases the unsorted part by taking the largest element from it and putting it into the sorted region. Unlike selection sort, heapsort does not waste time scanning the unsorted region in linear time; instead, heap sort keeps the unsorted region in a heap data structure to identify the largest element in each step more rapidly. Let us take a look at the heap sort algorithm: The Heapsort algorithm starts by converting the list to a max heap. The algorithm then swaps the first and last values in the list, reducing the range of values considered in the heap operation by one, and filters the new first value into its heap place. This process is repeated until the range of values considered is only one value long. On the list, use the buildMaxHeap() function. This function, also known as heapify(), creates a heap from a list in O(n) operations. Change the order of the list's first and last elements. Reduce the list's considered range by one. To si"
"29. What is the space complexity of the insertion sort algorithm? Insertion sort is an in-place sorting method, which implies it does not require any additional or minimal data storage. In insertion sort, only a single list element must be stored outside of the starting data, resulting in a constant space complexity or O(1) space complexity."

C# has four types of such classes: Static class: Static class, defined by the keyword ‘static’ does not allow inheritance. Therefore, you cannot create an object for a static class. Sample code: C# Interview Questions static class classname { //static data members //static methods } Partial class: Partial class, defined by the keyword ‘partial’ allows its members to partially divide or share source (.cs) files. Abstract class: Abstract classes are classes that cannot be instantiated where you cannot create objects. Abstract classes work on the OOPS concept of abstraction. Abstraction helps to extract essential details and hide the unessential ones. Sealed class: Sealed classes are classes that cannot be inherited. Use the keyword sealed to restrict access to users to inherit that class. sealed class InterviewBit { // data members // methods . . . }"

"6. What is the diﬀerence between an abstract class and an interface? Let’s dig into the diﬀerences between an abstract class and an interface: Abstract classes are classes that cannot be instantiated ie. that cannot create an object. The interface is like an abstract class because all the methods inside the interface are abstract methods. Surprisingly, abstract classes can have both abstract and non-abstract methods but all the methods of an interface are abstract methods. Since abstract classes can have both abstract and non-abstract methods, we need to use the Abstract keyword to declare abstract methods. But in the interface, there is no such need. An abstract class has constructors while an interface encompasses none. Ex. Abstract class: public abstract class Shape{ public abstract void draw(); } Interface: C# Interview Questions public interface Paintable{ void paint(); }"
"7. What are the diﬀerences between ref and out keywords? C# ref keywords pass arguments by reference and not value. To use the ‘ref’ keyword, you need to explicitly mention ‘ref’. void Method(ref int refArgument) { refArgument = refArgument + 10; } int number = 1; Method(ref number); Console.WriteLine(number); // Output: 11 C# out keywords pass arguments within methods and functions. ‘out’ keyword is used to pass arguments in a method as a reference to return multiple values. Although it is the same as the ref keyword, the ref keyword needs to be initialised before it is passed. Here, The out and ref keywords are useful when we want to return a value in the same variables that are passed as an argument. public static string GetNextFeature(ref int id) { string returnText = ""Next-"" + id.ToString(); id += 1; return returnText; } public static string GetNextFeature(out int id) { id = 1; string returnText = ""Next-"" + id.ToString(); return returnText; }"

"9. What are Generics in C#? In C# collections, defining any kind of object is termed okay which compromises C#’s basic rule of type-safety. Therefore, generics were included to type-safe the code by allowing re-use of the data processing algorithms. Generics in C# mean not linked to any specific data type. Generics reduce the load of using boxing, unboxing, and typecasting objects. Generics are always defined inside angular brackets <>. To create a generic class, this syntax is used: GenericList<float> list1 = new GenericList<float>(); GenericList<Features> list2 = new GenericList<Features>(); GenericList<Struct> list3 = new GenericList<Struct>(); Here, GenericList<float> is a generic class. In each of these instances of GenericList<T>, every occurrence of T in the class is substituted at run time with the type argument. By substituting the T, we have created three diﬀerent type-safe using the same class."
"10. What is the diﬀerence between an Array and ArrayList in C#? An array is a collection of similar variables clubbed together under one common name. While ArrayList is a collection of objects that can be indexed individually. With ArrayList you can access a number of features like dynamic memory allocation, adding, searching, and sorting items in the ArrayList. C# Interview Questions When declaring an array the size of the items is fixed therefore, the memory allocation is fixed. But with ArrayList, it can be increased or decreased dynamically. Array belongs to system.array namespace while ArrayList belongs to the system.collection namespace. All items in an array are of the same datatype while all the items in an ArrayList can be of the same or diﬀerent data types. While arrays cannot accept null, ArrayList can accept null values. For ex.: // C# program to illustrate the ArrayList using System; using System.Collections; class IB { // Main Method public static void Main(string[] args) { // Create a list of strings ArrayList al = new ArrayList(); al.Add(""Bruno""); al.Add(""Husky""); al.Add(10); al.Add(10.10); // Iterate list element using foreach loop foreach(var names in al) { Console.WriteLine(names); } } }"

The two functions are used for typecasting the data types: Boxing: Boxing converts value type (int, char, etc.) to reference type (object) which is an implicit conversion process using object value. Example: int num = 23; // 23 will assigned to num Object Obj = num; // Boxing Unboxing: Unboxing converts reference type (object) to value type (int, char, etc.) using an explicit conversion process. Example: int num = 23; // value type is int and assigned value 23 Object Obj = num; // Boxing int i = (int)Obj; // Unboxing"
"13. What are Properties in C#? Properties in C# are public members of a class where they provide the ability to access private members of a class. The basic principle of encapsulation lets you hide some sensitive properties from the users by making the variables private. The private members are not accessible otherwise in a class. Therefore, by using properties in C# you can easily access the private members and set their values. The values can be easily assigned using get and set methods, also known as accessors. While the get method extracts the value, the set method assigns the value to the variables."
"14. What are partial classes in C#? C# Interview Questions Partial classes implement the functionality of a single class into multiple files. These multiple files are combined into one during compile time. The partial class can be created using the partial keyword. public partial Clas_name { // code } You can easily split the functionalities of methods, interfaces, or structures into multiple files. You can even add nested partial classes."
"15. What is the diﬀerence between late binding and early binding in C#? Late binding and early binding are examples of one of the primary concepts of OOPS: Polymorphism. For ex: one function calculateBill() will calculate bills of premium customers, basic customers, and semi-premium customers based on their policies diﬀerently. The calculation for all the customer objects is done diﬀerently using the same function which is called polymorphism. When an object is assigned to an object variable in C#, the .NET framework performs the binding. When the binding function happens at compile-time, it is called early binding. It investigates and checks the methods and properties of the static objects. With early binding, the number of run-time errors decreases substantially and it executes pretty quickly. But when the binding happens at runtime, it is called late binding. Late binding happens when the objects are dynamic (decided based on the data they hold) at run- time. It is slower as it looks through during run-time. C# Interview Questions"
"16. What are the Arrays in C#? When a group of similar elements is clubbed together under one name, they are called arrays. For ex. An array of tea Atea[4]: [green tea, chamomile tea, black tea, lemon tea]. The length of the array defines how many elements are present in the array. In C#, the memory allocations for the elements of the array happen dynamically. This is how values are stored in an array sequentially. Arrays in C# A few pointers for arrays in C#: The memory allocation is DYNAMIC. Arrays in C# are treated as objects. The length of the array is easy to find by detecting the number of members in the array. The members in the array are ordered and begin with the index value=0. The array types are reference types derived from the base array type. C# Interview Questions Syntax: < Data Type > [ ] < Name_Array >"
17. What are Indexers in C#? Indexers are called smart arrays that allow access to a member variable. Indexers allow member variables using the features of an array. They are created using the Indexer keyword. Indexers are not static members. For ex. Here the indexer is defined the same way. <return type> this[<parameter type> index] { get{ // return the value from the specified index of an internal collection } set{ // set values at the specified index in an internal collection } }
"18. Diﬀerence between the Equality Operator (==) and Equals() Method in C#? Although both are used to compare two objects by value, still they both are used diﬀerently. For ex.: int x = 10; int y = 10; Console.WriteLine( x == y); Console.WriteLine(x.Equals(y)); Output: True True C# Interview Questions Equality operator (==) is a reference type which means that if equality operator is used, it will return true only if both the references point to the same object. Equals() method: Equals method is used to compare the values carried by the objects. int x=10, int y=10. If x==y is compared then, the values carried by x and y are compared which is equal and therefore they return true. Equality operator: Compares by reference Equals(): Compares by value"
"19. What are the diﬀerent ways in which a method can be Overloaded in C#? Overloading means when a method has the same name but carries diﬀerent values to use in a diﬀerent context. Only the main() method cannot be overloaded. In order to overload methods in C#, Change the number of parameters in a method, or Change the order of parameters in a method, or Use diﬀerent data types for parameters In these ways, you can overload a method multiple times. For ex. public class Area { public double area(double x) { double area = x * x; return area; } public double area(double a, double b) { double area = a * b; return area; } } C# Interview Questions Here, the method Area is used twice. In the first declaration, one argument is used while in the second one, there were two arguments are used. Using diﬀerent parameters in the same method, we were able to overload the method area()."
"20. What is Reflection in C#? Reflection in C# extracts metadata from the datatypes during runtime. To add reflection in the .NET framework, simply use System.Refelction namespace in your program to retrieve the type which can be anything from: Assembly Module Enum MethodInfo ConstructorInfo MemberInfo ParameterInfo Type FieldInfo EventInfo PropertyInfo"
"21. What is the diﬀerence between constant and readonly in C#? A const keyword in C# is used to declare a constant field throughout the program. That means once a variable has been declared const, its value cannot be changed throughout the program. In C#, a constant is a number, string, null reference, or boolean values. For ex: C# Interview Questions class IB { // Constant fields public const int xvar = 20; public const string str = ""InterviewBit""; // Main method static public void Main() { // Display the value of Constant fields Console.WriteLine(""The value of xvar: {0}"", xvar); Console.WriteLine(""The value of str: {0}"", str); } } Output: The value of xvar is 20. The value of string is Interview Bit On the other hand, with readonly keyword, you can assign the variable only when it is declared or in a constructor of the same class in which it is declared. Ex: C# Interview Questions public readonly int xvar1; public readonly int yvar2; // Values of the readonly // variables are assigned // Using constructor public IB(int b, int c) { xvar1 = b; yvar2 = c; Console.WriteLine(""The value of xvar1 {0}, ""+ ""and yvar2 {1}"", xvar1, yvar2); } // Main method static public void Main() { IB obj1 = new IB(50, 60); } } Output: The value of xvar1 is 50, and yvar2 is 60 Constants are static by default while readonly should have a value assigned when the constructor is declared. Constants can be declared within functions while readonly modifiers can be used with reference types."
"22. What is the diﬀerence between String and StringBuilder in C#? The major diﬀerence between String and StringBuilder is that String objects are immutable while StringBuilder creates a mutable string of characters. StringBuilder will make the changes to the existing object rather than creating a new object. StringBuilder simplifies the entire process of making changes to the existing string object. Since the String class is immutable, it is costlier to create a new object every time we need to make a change. So, the StringBuilder class comes into picture which can be evoked using the System.Text namespace. C# Interview Questions In case, a string object will not change throughout the entire program, then use String class or else StringBuilder. For ex: string s = string.Empty; for (i = 0; i < 1000; i++) { s += i.ToString() + "" ""; } Here, you’ll need to create 2001 objects out of which 2000 will be of no use. The same can be applied using StringBuilder: StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(); for (i = 0; i < 1000; i++) { sb.Append(i); sb.Append(' '); } By using StringBuilder here, you also de-stress the memory allocator. C# Coding Problems"

4. What is the use of printf() and scanf() functions? Also explain format specifiers? printf() is used to print the output on the display. scanf() is used to read formatted data from the keyboard. Some datatype format specifiers for both printing and scanning purposes are as follows: %d: It's a datatype format specifier for printing and scanning an integer value. %s: It's a datatype format specifier for printing and scanning a string. %c: It's a datatype format specifier for displaying and scanning a character value. %f: The datatype format specifier %f is used to display and scan a float value. C Interview Questions
"5. What's the value of the expression 5[""abxdef""]? The answer is 'f'. Explanation: The string mentioned ""abxdef"" is an array, and the expression is equal to ""abxdef""[5]. Why is the inside-out expression equivalent? Because a[b] is equivalent to *(a + b) which is equivalent to *(b + a) which is equivalent to b[a]."
"6. What is a built-in function in C? The most commonly used built-in functions in C are sacnf(), printf(), strcpy, strlwr, strcmp, strlen, strcat, and many more. Built-function is also known as library functions that are provided by the system to make the life of a developer easy by assisting them to do certain commonly used predefined tasks. For example, if you need to print output or your program into the terminal, we use printf() in C."
7. What is a Preprocessor? A preprocessor is a so
"8. In C, What is the #line used for? In C, #line is used as a preprocessor to re-set the line number in the code, which takes a parameter as line number. Here is an example for the same. #include <stdio.h> /*line 1*/ /*line 2*/ int main(){ /*line 3*/ /*line 4*/ printf(""Hello world\\n""); /*line 5*/ //print current line /*line 6*/ printf(""Line: %d\\n"",__LINE__); /*line 7*/ //reset the line number by 36 /*line 8*/ #line 36 /*reseting*/ //print current line /*line 36*/ printf(""Line: %d\\n"",__LINE__); /*line 37*/ printf(""Bye bye!!!\\n""); /*line 39*/ /*line 40*/ return 0; /*line 41*/ } /*line 42*/"
"9. How can a string be converted to a number? The function takes the string as an input that needs to be converted to an integer. int atoi(const char *string) Return Value: On successful conversion, it returns the desired integer value If the string starts with alpha-numeric char or only contains alpha-num char, 0 is returned. In case string starts with numeric character but is followed by alpha-num char, the string is converted to integer till the first occurrence of alphanumeric char.

"11. What is recursion in C? When a function in C calls a copy of itself, this is known as recursion. To put it another way, when a function calls itself, this technique is called Recursion. Also, this function is known as recursive function. Syntax of Recursive Function: void do_recursion() { ... .. ... do_recursion(); ... .. ...] } int main() { ... .. ... do_recursion(); ... .. ... }"
12. Why doesn’t C support function overloading? A
"13. What is the diﬀerence between global int and static int declaration? The diﬀerence between this is in scope. A truly global variable has a global scope and is visible everywhere in your program. #include <stdio.h> int my_global_var = 0; int main(void) { printf(""%d\\n"", my_global_var); return 0; } global_temp is a global variable that is visible to everything in your program, although to make it visible in other modules, you'd need an ”extern int global_temp; ” in other source files if you have a multi-file project. A static variable has a local scope but its variables are not allocated in the stack segment of the memory. It can have less than global scope, although - like global variables - it resides in the .bss segment of your compiled binary. C Interview Questions #include <stdio.h> int myfunc(int val) { static int my_static_var = 0; my_static_var += val; return my_static_var; } int main(void) { int myval; myval = myfunc(1); printf(""first call %d\\n"", myval); myval = myfunc(10); printf(""second call %d\\n"", myval); return 0; }"
"14. What is a pointer in C? A pointer is a variable that stores or points to another variable's address. The value of a variable is stored in a normal variable, whereas the address of a variable is stored in a pointer variable. C Interview Questions"
"15. Diﬀerence between const char* p and char const* p? const char* p is a pointer to a const char. char const* p is a pointer to a char const. Since const char and char const are the same, it's the same."
"16. What is pointer to pointer in C? In C, a pointer can also be used to store the address of another pointer. A double pointer or pointer to pointer is such a pointer. The address of a variable is stored in the first pointer, whereas the address of the first pointer is stored in the second pointer. The syntax of declaring a double pointer is given below: int **p; // pointer to a pointer which is pointing to an integer"
"17. Why n++ executes faster than n+1 ? C Interview Questions n++ being a unary operation, it just needs one variable. Whereas, n = n + 1 is a binary operation that adds overhead to take more time (also binary operation: n += 1). However, in modern platforms, it depends on few things such as processor architecture, C compiler, usage in your code, and other factors such as hardware problems. While in the modern compiler even if you write n = n + 1 it will get converted into n++ when it goes into the optimized binary, and it will be equivalently eﬀicient."
"18. What is typecasting in C? Typecasting is the process to convert a variable from one datatype to another. If we want to store the large type value to an int type, then we will convert the data type into another data type explicitly. Syntax: (data_type)expression; For Example: int x; for(x=97; x<=122; x++) { printf(""%c"", (char)x); /*Explicit casting from int to char*/ }"
"19. What are the advantages of Macro over function? C Interview Questions Macro on a high-level copy-paste, its definitions to places wherever it is called. Due to which it saves a lot of time, as no time is spent while passing the control to a new function and the control is always with the callee function. However, one downside is the size of the compiled binary is large but once compiled the program comparatively runs faster."
"20. What are Enumerations? Enumeration, also known as Enum in C, is a user-defined data type. It consists of constant integrals or integers that have names assigned to them by the user. Because the integer values are named with enum in C, the whole program is simple to learn, understand, and maintain by the same or even diﬀerent programmer."
"21. When should we use the register storage specifier? If a variable is used frequently, it should be declared with the register storage specifier, and the compiler may allocate a CPU register for its storage to speed up variable lookup. C Intermediate Interview Questions"
22. Specify diﬀerent types of decision control statements? All statements written in a program are executed from top to bottom one by one. Control statements are used to execute/transfer the control from one part of the program to another depending on the condition. If-else statement. normal if-else statement. Else-if statement nested if-else statement. Switch statement.
"23. What is an r-value and l-value? C Interview Questions The term ""r-value"" refers to a data value stored in memory at a given address. An r-value is an expression that cannot have a value assigned to it, hence it can only exist on the right side of an assignment operator(=). The term ""l-value"" refers to a memory location that is used to identify an object. The l-value can be found on either the le"
"24. What is the diﬀerence between malloc() and calloc()? calloc() and malloc() are memory dynamic memory allocating functions. The main diﬀerence is that malloc() only takes one argument, which is the number of bytes, but calloc() takes two arguments, which are the number of blocks and the size of each block."
"25. What is the diﬀerence between struct and union in C? A struct is a group of complex data structures stored in a block of memory where each member on the block gets a separate memory location to make them accessible at once Whereas in the union, all the member variables are stored at the same location on the memory as a result to which while assigning a value to a member variable will change the value of all other members. C Interview Questions /* struct & union definations*/ struct bar { int a; // we can use a & b both simultaneously char b; } bar; union foo { int a; // we can't use both a and b simultaneously char b; } foo; /* using struc and union variables*/ struct bar y; y.a = 3; // OK to use y.b = 'c'; // OK to use union foo x; x.a = 3; // OK x.b = 'c'; // NOl this affects the value of x.a!"
"26. What is call by reference in functions? When we caller function makes a function call bypassing the addresses of actual parameters being passed, then this is called call by reference. In incall by reference, the operation performed on formal parameters aﬀects the value of actual parameters because all the operations performed on the value stored in the address of actual parameters."
"27. What is pass by reference in functions? In Pass by reference, the callee receives the address and makes a copy of the address of an argument into the formal parameter. Callee function uses the address to access the actual argument (to do some manipulation). If the callee function changes the value addressed at the passed address it will be visible to the caller function as well. C Interview Questions Pass By Reference"
"28. What is a memory leak? How to avoid it? When we assign a variable it takes space of our RAM (either heap or RAM)dependent on the size of data type, however, if a programmer uses a memory available on the heap and forgets to a delta it, at some point all the memory available on the ram will be occupied with no memory le"
"29. What is Dynamic memory allocation in C? Name the dynamic allocation functions. C Interview Questions C is a language known for its low-level control over the memory allocation of variables in DMA there are two major standard library malloc() and free. The malloc() function takes a single input parameter which tells the size of the memory requested It returns a pointer to the allocated memory. If the allocation fails, it returns NULL. The prototype for the standard library function is like this: void *malloc(size_t size); The free() function takes the pointer returned by malloc() and de-allocates the memory. No indication of success or failure is returned. The function prototype is like this: void free(void *pointer); There are 4 library functions provided by C defined under <stdlib.h> header file to facilitate dynamic memory allocation in C programming. They are: malloc() calloc() free() realloc()"
"30. What is typedef? typedef is a C keyword, used to define alias/synonyms for an existing type in C language. In most cases, we use typedef's to simplify the existing type declaration syntax. Or to provide specific descriptive names to a type. typedef <existing-type> <new-type-identifiers>; typedef provides an alias name to the existing complex type definition. With typedef, you can simply create an alias for any type. Whether it is a simple integer to complex function pointer or structure declaration, typedef will shorten your code."
"31. Why is it usually a bad idea to use gets()? Suggest a workaround. C Interview Questions The standard input library gets() reads user input till it encounters a new line character. However, it does not check on the size of the variable being provided by the user is under the maximum size of the data type which makes the system vulnerable to buﬀer overflow and the input being written into memory where it isn’t supposed to. We, therefore, use gets() to achieve the same with a restricted range of input Bonus: It remained an oﬀicial part of the language up to the 1999 ISO C standard, but it was oﬀicially removed by the 2011 standard. Most C implementations still support it, but at least GCC issues a warning for any code that uses it."
"32. What is the diﬀerence between #include ""..."" and #include <...>? In practice, the diﬀerence is in the location where the preprocessor searches for the included file. For #include <filename> the C preprocessor looks for the filename in the predefined list of system directories first and then to the directories told by the user(we can use - I option to add directories to the mentioned predefined list). For #include ""filename"" the preprocessor searches first in the same directory as the file containing the directive, and then follows the search path used for the #include <filename> form. This method is normally used to include programmer-defined header files."
"33. What are dangling pointers? How are dangling pointers diﬀerent from memory leaks? The dangling pointer points to a memory that has already been freed. The storage is no longer allocated. Trying to access it might cause a Segmentation fault. A common way to end up with a dangling pointer: C Interview Questions #include<stdio.h> #include<string.h> char *func() { char str[10]; strcpy(str,""Hello!""); return(str); } You are returning an address that was a local variable, which would have gone out of scope by the time control was returned to the calling function. (Undefined behavior) *c = malloc(5izeof(int)); free(c); *c = 3; //writing to freed location! In the figure shown above writing to a memory that has been freed is an example of the dangling pointer, which makes the program crash. A memory leak is something where the memory allocated is not freed which causes the program to use an undefined amount of memory from the ram making it unavailable for every other running program(or daemon) which causes the programs to crash. There are various tools like O profile testing which is useful to detect memory leaks on your programs. void function(){ char *leak = malloc (10); //leak assigned but not freed }"
34. What is the diﬀerence between ‘g’ and “g” in C? In C double-quotes variables are identified as a string whereas single-quoted variables are identified as the character. Another major diﬀerence being the string (double-quoted) variables end with a null terminator that makes it a 2 character array.
"35. What is a near pointer and a far pointer in C? C Interview Questions Near Pointer: In general, the near pointer can be considered because it is used to hold the address, which has a maximum size of just 16 bits. We can't store an address with a size larger than 16 bits using the near pointer. All other smaller addresses that are within the 16-bit limit, on the other hand, can be stored. Because we can only access 64kb of data at a time, you might assume the 16 bits are insuﬀicient. As a result, it is regarded as one of the near-pointer's biggest drawbacks, which is why it is no longer commonly used. Far Pointer: A far pointer is considered a pointer of size 32 bits. It can, however, use the current segment to access information stored outside the computer's memory. Although, in order to use this type of pointer, we usually need to allocate the sector register to store the data address in the current segment."
"36. Which structure is used to link the program and the operating system? The file structure is used to link the operating system and a program. The header file ""stdio.h"" (standard input/output header file) defines the file. It contains information about the file being used like its current size and its memory location. It contains a character pointer that points to the character which is currently being opened. When you open a file, it establishes a link between the program and the operating system about which file is to be accessed."
37. Suppose a global variable and local variable have the same name. Is it possible to access a global variable from a block where local variables are defined? No. This isn’t possible in C. It’s always the most local variable that gets preference.
"38. Which is better #define or enum? C Interview Questions If we let it, the compiler can build enum values automatically. However, each of the defined values must be given separately. Because macros are preprocessors, unlike enums, which are compile-time entities, the source code is unaware of these macros. So, if we use a debugger to debug the code, the enum is superior. Some compilers will give a warning if we use enum values in a switch and the default case is missing. Enum always generates int-type identifiers. The macro, on the other hand, allowed us to pick between various integral types. Unlike enum, the macro does not have a defined scope constraint. C Interview Questions For Experienced"

46. Can you tell me how to check whether a linked list is circular? Single Linked List Single Linked List Circular Linked List Circular linked list is a variation of a linked list where the last node is pointing to the first node's information part. Therefore the last node does not point to null. C Interview Questions Algorithm to find whether the given linked list is circular A very simple way to determine whether the linked list is circular or not Traverse the linked list Check if the node is pointing to the head. If yes then it is circular. Let's look at the snippet where we code this algorithm.

Create a structure for a linked list Declare -Variable to store data of the node. -Pointer variable of struct type to store the address of next node. function of datatype tool isCircular(firstgode){ -Store the value of first node in temp variable and make it traverse all nodes. -temp-firstgode -tempenext node pointed by temp(temp->next) -run until temp is at null or firstNode if (temp at null) not circular and returns false if (temp points first node) return true as its circular. } function of datatype node newNode(data){ -To insert new nodes and link each one of them to the previous node by storing the addr -Then make them point to NULL. } In int main function -First insert nodes for circular linked list and check its nature by calling isCircular -Since it is true through if statement it prints ""yes.. -Second insert a normal linked list and check its nature by calling isCircular function C Interview Questions It is majorly related to how the compiler reads( or parses) the entire code and breaks it into a set of instructions(or statements), to which semicolon in C acts as a boundary between two sets of instructions."
"48. How to call a function before main()? To call a function before the main(), pragma startup directive should be used. E.g.- #pragma startup fun void fun() { printf(""In fun\\n""); } main() { printf(""In main\\n""); } The output of the above program will be - In fun In main This pragma directive, on the other hand, is compiler-dependent. This is not supported by gcc. As a result, it will ignore the startup directive and produce no error. But the output, in that case, will be - In main"
49. Diﬀerentiate between the macros and the functions. The diﬀerences between macros and functions can be explained as follows: C Interview Questions Macros Functions It is preprocessed rather than compiled.It is compiled not preprocessed. It is preprocessed rather than compiled.Function checks for compilation errors. Code length is increased.Code length remains the same. Macros are faster in execution.Functions are a bit slower in execution. Macros are useful when a small piece of code is used multiple times in a program.Functions are helpful when a large piece of code is repeated a number of times.
"50. Diﬀerentiate Source Codes from Object Codes Source Code and Object Code Diﬀerence C Interview Questions The diﬀerence between the Source Code and Object Code is that Source Code is a collection of computer instructions written using a human-readable programming language while Object Code is a sequence of statements in machine language, and is the output a"
"51. What are header files and what are its uses in C programming? Header Files in C In C header files must have the extension as .h, which contains function definitions, data type definitions, macro, etc. The header is useful to import the above definitions to the source code using the #include directive. For example, if your source code needs to take input from the user do some manipulation and print the output on the terminal, it should have stdio.h file included as #include <stdio.h>, with which we can take input using scanf() do some manipulation and print using printf()."
"52. When is the ""void"" keyword used in a function C Interview Questions The keyword “void” is a data type that literally represents no data at all. The most obvious use of this is a function that returns nothing: void PrintHello() { printf(""Hello\\n""); return; // the function does ""return"", but no value is returned } Here we’ve declared a function, and all functions have a return type. In this case, we’ve said the return type is “void”, and that means, “no data at all” is returned. The other use for the void keyword is a void pointer. A void pointer points to the memory location where the data type is undefined at the time of variable definition. Even you can define a function of return type void* or void pointer meaning “at compile time we don’t know what it will return” Let’s see an example of that. void MyMemCopy(void* dst, const void* src, int numBytes) { char* dst_c = reinterpret_cast<char*>(dst); const char* src_c = reinterpret_cast<const char*>(src); for (int i = 0; i < numBytes; ++i) dst_c[i] = src_c[i]; }"
"53. What is dynamic data structure? A dynamic data structure (DDS) refers to an organization or collection of data in memory that has the flexibility to grow or shrink in size, enabling a programmer to control exactly how much memory is utilized. Dynamic data structures change in size by having unused memory allocated or de-allocated from the heap as needed. Dynamic data structures play a key role in programming languages like C, C++, and Java because they provide the programmer with the flexibility to adjust the memory consumption of so"

"Java String Interview Questions Strings, one of the most common objects used in Java programming, are essentially sequences of characters. As an example, the string ""Scaler"" contains the following characters: ""S"", ""c"", ""a"", ""l"", ""e"", and ""r"". You can either create a string by using String Literal or by using the NEW keyword. Additionally, String supports a variety of methods to operate on Strings, such as the equals method to compare two Strings, the replace method to replace String characters, the substring method to get a substring, the toUpperCase method to convert String to upper case, the split method to split a long String into multiple Strings, and so on. Now let's look at the most common asked String Interview questions: Java String Interview Questions for Freshers Java String Interview Questions for Experienced String Programming Questions Java String Interview Questions for Freshers"
"1. How to declare a string in Java? String declaration in Java can be done in two ways: By string literal: Double quotes are used to create Java String literals. Example: String str= ""Scaler""; By new keyword: Keyword ""new"" is used to create a Java string. Example: String str=new String (""Scaler"");"
"2. Is String a primitive or derived type in Java? Strings are derived data types. Strings are Java objects that represent sequences of characters. String objects are created using the java.lang.String class. There are many functions that need to be called upon when processing a string, such as substring(), indexof(), equals(), toUppercase(), etc, which primitives types do not have."
"3. State the diﬀerence between String in C and String in Java. Java String Interview Questions String in C: In C, strings are just arrays of characters, and they are terminated with a /0, which is why we commonly refer to them as ""null-terminated"". Strings in C, like ""abc$%"", actually consist of 6 characters 'a' 'b' 'c' '$' '%' and '/0', but these can be easily manipulated. String in Java: Java treats Strings as objects, not arrays. String objects are created using the java.lang.String class. String objects in Java are immutable; you cannot modify their contents. This means whenever we manipulate a String object, the new String is created rather than the original string being modified."
"4. Explain String pool in Java. String Pool, also known as SCP (String Constant Pool), is a special storage space in Java heap memory that is used to store unique string objects. Whenever a string object is created, it first checks whether the String object with the same string value is already present in the String pool or not, and if it is available, then the reference to the string object from the string pool is returned. Otherwise, the new string object is added to the string pool, and the respective reference will be returned. Java String Interview Questions As shown in the above image, two Strings s1 and s2 are created with the values ""Apple"" and ""Mango"". Therefore, when the third String s3 containing the value ""Apple"" is created, instead of creating a new object, the existing object reference will be returned. Here, s1==s2 is false both strings s1 and s2 refer to diﬀerent string values from the string pool i.e. apple and mango. We can see that s1==s3 is true because both strings s1 and s3 refer to a single string value from a string pool i.e., apple."
"5. Is String immutable or final in Java? If so, then what are the benefits of Strings being Immutable? Yes, Strings are immutable in Java. Immutable objects mean they can't be changed or altered once they've been created. However, we can only modify the reference to the string object. The String is immutable in Java because of many reasons like security, caching, synchronization and concurrency, and class loading."
"6. What does the string intern() method do in Java? If you apply the intern() method to a few strings, you will ensure that all strings having the same content share the same memory. As soon as a String object is invoked with intern(), it first checks if the string value of the String object is already present in the string pool and if it is available, then the reference to that string from the string constant pool is returned. If not, a new string object is added to the string pool, and a reference to it is returned. Example: String str1 = new String(""Scaler by InterviewBit"").intern(); //Line1 String str2 = new String(""Scaler by InterviewBitt"").intern(); //Line2 System.out.println(str1 == str); //prints true As you can see, the intern() method is invoked on the String objects. When Line1 is executed, memory is allocated within the SCP. In line 2, no new string objects are created in the SCP because str1 and str2 have the same content. As a result, the reference to the object created in line1 is returned. This means that str1 and str2 both point to the same memory. Therefore, the print statement prints true."

"8. State the diﬀerence between StringBuﬀer and StringBuilder in Java. Java String Interview Questions StringBuﬀer and StringBuilder are two Java classes for manipulating strings. These are mutable objects, i.e., they can be modified, and provide various methods such as insert(), substring(), delete(), and append(), for String manipulation. StringBuﬀer: The StringBuﬀer class was created by the Java Team when they realized the need for an editable string object. Nevertheless, StringBuﬀer has all methods synchronized, meaning they are thread-safe. Therefore, StringBuﬀer allows only one thread to access a method at once, so it is not possible to call StringBuﬀer methods from two threads simultaneously, which means it takes more time to access. The StringBuﬀer class has synchronized methods, making it thread-safe, slower, and less eﬀicient than StringBuilder. The StringBuﬀer class was introduced in Java 1.0. Syntax: StringBuffer var = new StringBuffer(str); StringBuilder: It was at that point that the Java Team realized that making all methods of StringBuﬀer synchronized wasn't the best idea, which led them to introduce StringBuilder. The StringBuilder class has no synchronized methods. Unlike StringBuﬀer, StringBuilder does not oﬀer synchronized methods, which makes it less thread-safe, faster, and more eﬀicient. StringBuilder was introduced in Java 1.5 in response to StringBuﬀer's shortcomings. Syntax: StringBuilder var = new StringBuilder(str);"
"9. In Java, how can two strings be compared? In Java, there are several ways for comparing two strings. The following are a few of them: String Equals Method: In this method, the strings are compared based on the values within them. If the values of the two strings are the same, it returns true; otherwise, it returns false. This method is case-sensitive. Java String Interview Questions Syntax: str1.equals(str2); For example: Input 1= Scaler Input 2= InterviewBit Output= false Input 1= Scaler Input 2= Scaler Output= true Input 1= Scaler Input 2= scaler Output= false String Equals Ignore Case: By using this method, the two strings are compared without taking into account the case (upper or lower). It returns true if the two values are the same and not null. Syntax: str1.equalsIgnoreCase(str2); For Example: Input 1= Scaler Input 2= InterviewBit Output= false Input 1= Scaler Input 2= Scaler Output= true Input 1= Scaler Input 2= scaler Output= true Java String Interview Questions Object Equals Method: The method returns true if its arguments are equal, otherwise, it returns false. Accordingly, if both arguments are null, the result is true, and if just one argument is null, the result is false. Syntax: Object.equals(str1, str2) For example: Input 1= Scaler Input 2= InterviewBit Output= false Input 1= Scaler Input 2= Scaler Output= true Input 1= Scaler Input 2= null Output= false Input 1= null Input 2= null Output= True String Compare To Method: This method compares input strings with each other. Upon comparison, the following value is returned:"
"1. If (str1>str2), a positive value is returned."
"2. If (str1==str2), 0 is returned."
"3. If (str1<str2), a negative value is returned. Syntax: str1.compareTo(str2) Example: Java String Interview Questions Input 1= InterviewBit Input 2= Scaler Output= -10 Input 1= Scaler Input 2= Scaler Output= 0 Input 1= Scaler Input 2= InterviewBit Output= 10"
"10. What is the diﬀerence between str1 == str2 and str1.equals(str2)? Java oﬀers both the equals() method and the ""=="" operator for comparing objects. However, here are some diﬀerences between the two: Essentially, equals() is a method, while == is an operator. The == operator can be used for comparing references (addresses) and the .equals() method can be used to compare content. To put it simply, == checks if the objects point to the same memory location, whereas .equals() compares the values of the objects. Example: public class StringComparison { public static void main(String[] args) { String str1=new String(""Scaler""); String str2=new String(""Scaler""); System.out.println(str1 == str2); System.out.println(str1.equals(str2)); } } Output: Java String Interview Questions false true In this example, two diﬀerent String objects are being created, str1 and str2. If str1 and str2 are compared using the == operator, then the result will be false, because both have diﬀerent addresses in the memory. Both must have the same address in the memory for the result to be true. If you use the equals method, the result is true since it's only comparing the values given to str1 and str2, even though they are diﬀerent objects."
"11. Is it possible to compare Strings using the == operator? If so, what is the risk involved? Yes, you can compare strings using the == operator. One can use == operators for reference comparison (address comparison). The majority of the time, developers compare strings with the == operator, instead of using the equals() method, resulting in an error. Example: public class StringComparison { public static void main(String args[]) { String str1=""Scaler""; String str2=""Scaler""; String str3=new String(""Scaler""); System.out.println(str1==str2); //true because both points to same memory allocation System.out.println(str1==str3); //false because str3 refers to instance created in heap System.out.println(str1.equals(str3)); //true because both share same content //even if both are different string objects } } Output: Java String Interview Questions true false true"
"12. What is the use of the substring() method in Java? The substring method is used to return substring from a specified string. This method takes two parameters i.e., beginIndex (the starting index) and endIndex (the ending index). In the case of substring(), method startIndex is inclusive and endIndex is exclusive. Syntax: substring(int beginIndex, int endIndex) Or substring(int beginIndex) Here, beginIndex: Index that marks the starting of subsequence and it is inclusive. endIndex: Index that marks the ending of subsequence and it is exclusive. Example: Java String Interview Questions import java.lang.Math; public class InterviewBit { // driver code public static void main(String args[]) { String str = ""Scaler by InterviewBit""; //prints substring from 7th index System.out.print(""Returns: ""); System.out.println(str.substring(7)); // prints substring from 0-6, exclusive 6th index System.out.print(""Returns: ""); System.out.println(str.substring(0, 6)); // prints the substring from 10-22, exclusive 22th index System.out.print(""Returns: ""); System.out.println(str.substring(10, 22)); } } Output: Returns: by InterviewBit Returns: Scaler Returns: InterviewBit"
"13. Can we use a string in the switch case in java? Yes, Java allows you to use strings in switch case conditions. Below is a Java program that shows the use of string in switch case. Example: Java String Interview Questions public class StringinSwitchCase { public static void main(String[] args) { String fruit = ""Apple""; switch(fruit) { case ""Mango"": System.out.println(""Sweet""); break; case ""Apple"": System.out.println(""Delicious""); break; case ""Orange"": System.out.println(""Luscious""); break; default: System.out.println(""Not a fruit""); } } } Output: Delicious Java String Interview Questions for Experienced"
"14. What are the diﬀerent string methods in Java? There are various string operations in Java that allow us to work with strings. These methods or operations can be used for string handling in Java as well as string manipulation in Java. Some of such methods are as follows: Java String Interview Questions split(): Split/divide the string at the specified regex. compareTo(): Compares two strings on the basis of the Unicode value of each string character. compareToIgnoreCase(): Similar to compareTo, but it also ignores case diﬀerences. length(): Returns the length of the specified string. substring(): Returns the substring from the specified string. equalsIgnoreCase(): Compares two strings ignoring case diﬀerences. contains(): Checks if a string contains a substring. trim(): Returns the substring a"
"15. Is String thread-safe in Java? Strings are immutable objects, which means they can't be changed or altered once they've been created. As a result, whenever we manipulate a String object, it creates a new String rather than modifying the original string object. In Java, every immutable object is thread-safe, which means String is also thread-safe. As a result, multiple threads can access a string. For instance, if a thread modifies the value of a string, instead of modifying the existing one, a new String is created, and therefore, the original string object that was shared among the threads remains unchanged."
"16. Why is a string used as a HashMap key in Java? Basically, the HashMap object can store key-value pairs. When creating a HashMap object and storing a key-value pair in that object, you will notice that while storing, the hash code of the key will be calculated, and its calculated value will be placed as the resultant hash code of the key. Now, when the key is passed to fetch its value, then the hash code of the key is calculated again, and if it's equal to the value of the hash code initially calculated, the initial value placed as the resultant hash code of the key is retrieved or fetched. Java String Interview Questions Let's say we utilized a variable as a key to store data and then changed the value of that variable. In this case, since we have altered the key, the hash code calculated of the current key will not match the hash code at which its value was originally stored. This makes retrieval impossible. String values are immutable, so once they've been created, they can't be changed. As a result, it is recommended to use Strings as HashMap keys."
"17. What is the best way to split a string in Java? Split() is a Java method for breaking a string based on a Java string delimiter (specified regex). For example, a space or a comma(,) will usually be used as the Java string split attribute to break or split the string. Syntax: string.split(String regex, int limit) Here, regex: String is divided at this specified regex. limit (optional parameter): Controls or limits the number of resulting substrings. Split() returns all potential substrings if the limit parameter is not specified or is 0. Example: public class SplitString { public static void main(String[] args) { String str = ""Scaler by InterviewBit""; // split string from space String[] result = str.split("" ""); for (int i=0; i < result.length; i++) { System.out.println(result[i]); } } } Java String Interview Questions Output: Scaler by InterviewBit"
"18. Why char array is preferred over a String in storing passwords? There are various reasons why a char array rather than a string should be used to store passwords. The following are a few of them: Strings are immutable: The content of Strings cannot be modified/overwritten because any modification will result in the creation of a new String. As a result, we should always save sensitive data like passwords, Social Security numbers, and so on in a char[] array rather than a String. Security: Because String is immutable, storing the password as plain text keeps it in memory until it is cleaned up by the garbage collector. As string uses SCP (String Constant Pool) for re-usability of a string, it's possible that it'll remain in memory for a long time, and anyone with access to the SCP or memory dump can simply identify or retrieve the password in plain text. That's another reason why we should use an encrypted password instead of plain text. Logfile safety: With an array, the data can be erased or wiped up, overwritten and the password will not be present anywhere in the system. Whereas, when using plain String, the chances of mistakenly printing the password to monitors, logs, or other insecure locations are substantially higher."
19. Explain the string subSequence method. The Java String subSequence() method is a built-in function that returns a charSequence (a subsequence) from a string.
"20. What do you mean by StringJoiner? StringJoiner is a Java class that allows you to construct or create a sequence of strings (characters) that are separated by delimiters like a hyphen(-), comma(,), etc. Optionally, you can also pass suﬀix and prefix to the char sequence. Java String Interview Questions Example: // importing StringJoiner class import java.util.StringJoiner; public class ExampleofStringJoiner { public static void main(String[] args) { StringJoiner joinStrings = new StringJoiner("","", ""["", ""]""); // passing comma(,) and square-brackets as delimiter // Adding values to StringJoiner joinStrings.add(""Scaler""); joinStrings.add(""By""); joinStrings.add(""InterviewBit""); System.out.println(joinStrings); } } Output: [Scaler,By,InterviewBit]"
"21. How can a Java string be converted into a byte array? The getBytes() method allows you to convert a string to a byte array by encoding or converting the specified string into a sequence of bytes using the default charset of the platform. Below is a Java program to convert a Java String to a byte array. Example: import java.util.Arrays; public class StringToByteArray { public static void main(String[] args) { String str = ""Scaler""; byte[] byteArray = str.getBytes(); // print the byte[] elements System.out.println(""String to byte array: "" + Arrays.toString(byteArray)); } } Java String Interview Questions Output: String to byte array: [83, 99, 97, 108, 101, 114]"
"22. In Java, how do you convert a string to an integer and vice versa? There is an Integer class in the Java lang package that provides diﬀerent methods for converting strings to integers and vice versa. The parseInt() method allows you to convert a String into an integer and the toString() method allows you to convert an Integer into a String. Below is a Java program to convert a string to an integer and vice versa. Example: public class StringtoInteger { public static void main(String args[]) { String str1 = ""1296""; int i= Integer.parseInt(str1); System.out.println(i); String str2 = Integer.toString(i); System.out.println(str2); } } Output: 1296 1296"
"23. How can we convert string to StringBuilder? The append() method can be used to convert String to StringBuilder, and the toString() method can be used to convert StringBuilder to String. Below is a Java program to convert a string array to one StringBuilder object using the append method. Example: Java String Interview Questions public class StringToStringBuilder { public static void main(String args[]) { String strs[] = {""Scaler"", ""by"", ""InterviewBit!""}; StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(); sb.append(strs[0]); sb.append("" ""+strs[1]); sb.append("" ""+strs[2]); System.out.println(sb.toString()); } } Output: Scaler by InterviewBit!"
"24. How do you check whether a String is empty in Java? The Java String class contains a particular method for determining whether or not a string is empty. The isEmpty() method determines whether or not a string has zero length. In the case where the length of the string is zero, it returns true, or else it returns false. Example: Java String Interview Questions public class StringEmpty { // Function to determine if String is empty public static boolean isStringEmpty(String str) { //Use the isEmpty() method //to determine if the string is empty. if (str.isEmpty()) return true; else return false; } public static void main(String args[]) { String str1=""InterviewBit""; //non-empty string String str2=""""; //empty string System.out.println(""Str1 \\"""" + str1 + ""\\"" is empty? "" + isStringEmpty(str1)); System.out.println(""Str2 \\"""" + str2 + ""\\"" is empty? "" + isStringEmpty(str2)); } } Output: Str1 ""InterviewBit"" is empty? false Str2 """" is empty? true"
"25. How many objects will be created for the following codes: A. String str1 = ""abc""; //Line1 String str2 = new String(""abc""); //Line2 B. String str1 = ""abc""; //Line1 String str2 = ""abc""; //Line2 C. Java String Interview Questions String str1 = new String(""abc""); //Line1 String str2 = new String(""abc""); //Line2 For A: In this case, two objects will be created. We know that whenever a Java string is created using a new keyword, then two objects will be created i.e. one in the Heap Area and another one in the String constant pool. When the line1 is executed, the new string object str1 gets created and stored in the string constant pool. However, when line2 is executed, only one object is created using a new operator that gets stored in the heap memory (str2). This is because String constant pool already has a String object with the same string value (abc), and therefore, the reference of the string str1 from the string constant pool is returned. For B: In this case, one object will be created. Here, for line1 (str1), one new object will get created in String constant pool, whereas for line 2, string str2 will create a reference to the String str1 because the string constant pool already has a String object str1 with the same string value (abc). For C: In this case, three objects will be created. In the case of line1 (str1), two objects are created, one in the string constant pool and one in the heap memory. As for line 2 (str2), one new object is created and stored in heap memory, but not in the string constant pool because a String constant pool object str1 already has the string object str1 with the same string value (abc). String Programming Questions"
"26. How to print all permutations of string in Java? The term ""permutation of the string"" refers to all of the conceivable new strings that can be created by swapping the positions of the given string's characters. For example, the string CAT has a total of 6 permutations i.e., [CAT, CTA, ACT, ATC, TCA, TAC]. Below is a Java program to print all permutations of a given string. Java String Interview Questions public class InterviewBit { // Function to display all permutations of the string str static void printallPermutns(String str, String str2) { // check if string is empty or null if (str.length() == 0) { System.out.print(str2 + "" ""); return; } for (int i = 0; i < str.length(); i++) { // ith character of str char ch = str.charAt(i); // Rest of the string after excluding // the ith character String str3 = str.substring(0, i) + str.substring(i + 1); // Recursive call printallPermutns(str3, str2 + ch); } } // Driver code public static void main(String[] args) { String s = ""cat""; printallPermutns(s, """"); } } Output: cat cta act atc tca tac"
"27. Write a program to calculate the total number of characters in the String? To find the total count of characters in a specified string, we can use the for loop, while loop, or do while loop. Below is a Java program to calculate the total number of characters in a string using for loop. Java String Interview Questions Output: Input String: Scaler by InterviewBit The total number of characters in the given string: 20"
"28. How to reverse a string in Java? There are diﬀerent ways to reverse a string in Java-like using CharAt() method, StringBuilder/StringBuﬀer Class, Reverse Iteration, etc. The reverse() method is available in both the StringBuilder and StringBuﬀer classes and is commonly used to reverse a string. The reverse () method simply reverses the order of the characters. Below is a Java program to reverse a string using the StringBuilder class. public class TotatCharacters { public static void main(String[] args) { String str = ""Scaler by InterviewBit""; int count = 0; System.out.println(""Input String: ""+str); //Count total characters in the given string except space for(int i = 0; i < str.length(); i++) { if(str.charAt(i) != ' ') count++; } //Display total number of characters in the given string System.out.println(""The total number of characters in the given string: "" + coun } } Java String Interview Questions public class ReverseString { // function to reverse a string using StringBuilder public static String revstr(String str) { return new StringBuilder(str).reverse().toString(); } public static void main(String[] args) { String str= ""Scaler by InterviewBit""; str= revstr(str); System.out.println(""Result after reversing a string is: ""+ str); } } Output: Result after reversing a string is: tiBweivretnI yb relacS"
"29. How to convert an Array to String in Java? An array can be converted to a string in four diﬀerent ways such as Arrays.toString() method, String.Join() method, StringBuilder.append() method, and Collectors.joining() method. Here, we will see an example of the Array.toString() method. Arrays.toString() returns a string representation of the array contents. The string represents the array's elements as a list, enclosed in square brackets (""[]""). The characters "", "" (a comma) followed by a space are used to separate adjacent elements. It returns “null” if the array is null. Java String Interview Questions import java.util.Arrays; public class ArrayToString { public static void main(String[] args) { String[] strArray = { ""Scaler"", ""by"", ""InterviewBit""}; String str1 = ConvertArraytoString(strArray); System.out.println(""An array converted to a string: "" + str1); } // Using the Arrays.toString() method public static String ConvertArraytoString(String[] strArray) { return Arrays.toString(strArray); } } Output: An array converted to a string: [Scaler, by, InterviewBit]"
"30. Is it possible to count the number of times a given character appears in a String? The charAt() method of the String class can be used to find out the number of times a specified character appears in a string. Below is a Java program to check the occurrences of a specified character in a string. Java String Interview Questions Output: The character 'e' appears 2 times in the given string 'InterviewBit'. As you can see, the above program checks how many times the character ch occurs in the string str. Whenever we encounter the character ch in the string, we increase the count by one. Finally, we print the total character count at the end."
"31. In what way should two strings be compared to determine whether they are anagrams? If two strings contain the same characters but in a diﬀerent order, they can be said to be anagrams. Consider dusty and study. In this case, dusty's characters can be formed into a study, or study's characters can be formed into dusty. Below is a java program to check if two strings are anagrams or not. public class CkeckforOccurences { public static void main(String[] args) { String str= ""InterviewBit""; char ch = 'e'; //character to look for occurrences is e int count = 0; for (int i = 0; i < str.length(); i++) { if (str.charAt(i) == ch) { count++; } } System.out.println(""The character '"" + ch + ""' appears "" + count + "" times in the } } Java String Interview Questions Output: bored and robed are anagrams of each other. import java.util.Arrays; public class CheckAngagram { public static void main(String[] args) { String str1 = ""Bored""; String str2 = ""Robed""; //Convert strings to lowercase str1 = str1.toLowerCase(); str2 = str2.toLowerCase(); // Check to see if the lengths are the same if(str1.length() == str2.length()) { // convert strings into char array char[] str1charArray = str1.toCharArray(); char[] str2charArray = str2.toCharArray(); // sort the char array Arrays.sort(str1charArray); Arrays.sort(str2charArray); // if the sorted char arrays are same or identical // then the strings are anagram boolean result = Arrays.equals(str1charArray, str2charArray); if(result) { System.out.println(str1 + "" and "" + str2 + "" are anagrams of each other } else { System.out.println(str1 + "" and "" + str2 + "" are not anagrams of each o } } else { System.out.println(str1 + "" and "" + str2 + "" are not anagrams of each other. } } } Java String Interview Questions In the above program, there are two strings i.e., str1 and str2. Here, we are comparing str1 and str2 to determine if they are anagrams. The strings are first converted to lowercase since Java is case-sensitive and B and b are two diﬀerent characters in Java. Here, str1.toCharArray(): Convert or transform the string into a char array. Arrays.sort(): It sorts the char arrays. Arrays.equals(): Checks or verifies if sorted char arrays are equal. In the case where sorted arrays are equal, the strings are anagrams."
"32. How can we remove a specific character from a String? There are several ways to remove a character from a string, such as removing the character at the beginning of the string, the end of the string, or at a specific position. It is possible to remove a specific character from a string using the replace() method. You can also use remove() with diﬀerent variations like replaceFirst(), replaceAll(), etc. Below is a Java program that uses replace(), replaceFirst(), and replaceAll() methods to remove characters from a String. Output: public class RemoveCharacter { public static void main(String args[]) { String str = ""Scaler by InterviewBit""; //remove the specified character. System.out.println(""String after removing 'e' = ""+str.replace(""e"", """")); //remove the first occurrence of the specified character.

String str1 = ""scaler""; //Line1 String str2 = new String(""scaler""); //Line2 str2.intern(); //Line 3 System.out.println(str1 == str2); The output of the above program is false. We know that when the intern() method is executed or invoked on a string object, then it checks whether the String pool already has a same string value (scaler) or not, and if it is available, then the reference to the that string from the string constant pool is returned. In the above example, the intern method is invoked on str2. However, since we didn't assign it back to str2, str2 remains unchanged and therefore, both str1 and str2 have diﬀerent references. If we change the code in line 3 to str2 = str2.intern(), then the output will be true."
"Node.js Interview Questions When functions can be treated like any other variable then those functions are first- class functions. There are many other programming languages, for example, scala, Haskell, etc which follow this including JS. Now because of this function can be passed as a param to another function(callback) or a function can return another function(higher-order function). map() and filter() are higher-order functions that are popularly used."
"2. What is Node.js and how it works? Node.js is a virtual machine that uses JavaScript as its scripting language and runs Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine. Basically, Node.js is based on an event-driven architecture where I/O runs asynchronously making it lightweight and eﬀicient. It is being used in developing desktop applications as well with a popular framework called electron as it provides API to access OS-level features such as file system, network, etc."
3. How do you manage packages in your node.js project? It can be managed by a number of package installers and their configuration file accordingly. Out of them mostly use npm or yarn. Both provide almost all libraries of javascript with extended features of controlling environment-specific configurations. To maintain versions of libs being installed in a project we use package.json and package-lock.json so that there is no issue in porting that app to a diﬀerent environment.
"4. How is Node.js better than other frameworks most popularly used? Node.js Interview Questions Node.js provides simplicity in development because of its non-blocking I/O and even-based model results in short response time and concurrent processing, unlike other frameworks where developers have to use thread management. It runs on a chrome v8 engine which is written in c++ and is highly performant with constant improvement. Also since we will use Javascript in both the frontend and backend the development will be much faster. And at last, there are ample libraries so that we don’t need to reinvent the wheel."
5. Explain the steps how “Control Flow” controls the functions calls? Control the order of execution Collect data Limit concurrency Call the following step in the program.
6. What are some commonly used timing features of Node.js? setTimeout/clearTimeout – This is used to implement delays in code execution. setInterval/clearInterval – This is used to run a code block multiple times. setImmediate/clearImmediate – This is used to set the execution of the code at the end of the event loop cycle. process.nextTick – This is used to set the execution of code at the beginning of the next event loop cycle.
7. What are the advantages of using promises instead of callbacks? Node.js Interview Questions The main advantage of using promise is you get an object to decide the action that needs to be taken a
8. What is fork in node JS? A fork in general is used to spawn child processes. In node it is used to create a new instance of v8 engine to run multiple workers to execute the code.
9. Why is Node.js single-threaded? Node.js was created explicitly as an experiment in async processing. This was to try a new theory of doing async processing on a single thread over the existing thread- based implementation of scaling via diﬀerent frameworks.
"10. How do you create a simple server in Node.js that returns Hello World? var http = require(""http""); http.createServer(function (request, response) { response.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'}); response.end('Hello World\\n'); }).listen(3000);"
"11. How many types of API functions are there in Node.js? There are two types of API functions: Asynchronous, non-blocking functions - mostly I/O operations which can be fork out of the main loop. Synchronous, blocking functions - mostly operations that influence the process running in the main loop."

13. List down the two arguments that async.queue takes as input? Task Function Concurrency Value
"14. What is the purpose of module.exports? This is used to expose functions of a particular module or file to be used elsewhere in the project. This can be used to encapsulate all similar functions in a file which further improves the project structure. For example, you have a file for all utils functions with util to get solutions in a diﬀerent programming language of a problem statement. const getSolutionInJavaScript = async ({ problem_id }) => { ... }; const getSolutionInPython = async ({ problem_id }) => { ... }; module.exports = { getSolutionInJavaScript, getSolutionInPython } Thus using module.exports we can use these functions in some other file: const { getSolutionInJavaScript, getSolutionInPython} = require(""./utils"")"
15. What tools can be used to assure consistent code style? ESLint can be used with any IDE to ensure a consistent coding style which further helps in maintaining the codebase. Intermediate Node.js Interview Questions
"16. What do you understand by callback hell? Node.js Interview Questions async_A(function(){ async_B(function(){ async_C(function(){ async_D(function(){ .... }); }); }); }); For the above example, we are passing callback functions and it makes the code unreadable and not maintainable, thus we should change the async logic to avoid this."
"17. What is an event-loop in Node JS? Whatever that is async is managed by event-loop using a queue and listener. We can get the idea using the following diagram: Node.js Event Loop Node.js Interview Questions So when an async function needs to be executed(or I/O) the main thread sends it to a diﬀerent thread allowing v8 to keep executing the main code. Event loop involves diﬀerent phases with specific tasks such as timers, pending callbacks, idle or prepare, poll, check, close callbacks with diﬀerent FIFO queues. Also in between iterations it checks for async I/O or timers and shuts down cleanly if there aren't any."
"18. If Node.js is single threaded then how does it handle concurrency? The main loop is single-threaded and all async calls are managed by libuv library. For example: const crypto = require(""crypto""); const start = Date.now(); function logHashTime() { crypto.pbkdf2(""a"", ""b"", 100000, 512, ""sha512"", () => { console.log(""Hash: "", Date.now() - start); }); } logHashTime(); logHashTime(); logHashTime(); logHashTime(); This gives the output: Hash: 1213 Hash: 1225 Hash: 1212 Hash: 1222 This is because libuv sets up a thread pool to handle such concurrency. How many threads will be there in the thread pool depends upon the number of cores but you can override this."
"19. Diﬀerentiate between process.nextTick() and setImmediate()? Node.js Interview Questions Both can be used to switch to an asynchronous mode of operation by listener functions. process.nextTick() sets the callback to execute but setImmediate pushes the callback in the queue to be executed. So the event loop runs in the following manner timers–>pending callbacks–>idle,prepare–>connections(poll,data,etc)–>check– >close callbacks In this process.nextTick() method adds the callback function to the start of the next event queue and setImmediate() method to place the function in the check phase of the next event queue."
"20. How does Node.js overcome the problem of blocking of I/O operations? Since the node has an event loop that can be used to handle all the I/O operations in an asynchronous manner without blocking the main function. So for example, if some network call needs to happen it will be scheduled in the event loop instead of the main thread(single thread). And if there are multiple such I/O calls each one will be queued accordingly to be executed separately(other than the main thread). Thus even though we have single-threaded JS, I/O ops are handled in a nonblocking way."
"21. How can we use async await in node.js? Here is an example of using async-await pattern: Node.js Interview Questions // this code is to retry with exponential backoff function wait (timeout) { return new Promise((resolve) => { setTimeout(() => { resolve() }, timeout); }); } async function requestWithRetry (url) { const MAX_RETRIES = 10; for (let i = 0; i <= MAX_RETRIES; i++) { try { return await request(url); } catch (err) { const timeout = Math.pow(2, i); console.log('Waiting', timeout, 'ms'); await wait(timeout); console.log('Retrying', err.message, i); } } }"
"22. What is node.js streams? Streams are instances of EventEmitter which can be used to work with streaming data in Node.js. They can be used for handling and manipulating streaming large files(videos, mp3, etc) over the network. They use buﬀers as their temporary storage. There are mainly four types of the stream: Writable: streams to which data can be written (for example, fs.createWriteStream()). Readable: streams from which data can be read (for example, fs.createReadStream()). Duplex: streams that are both Readable and Writable (for example, net.Socket). Transform: Duplex streams that can modify or transform the data as it is written and read (for example, zlib.createDeflate())."
"23. What are node.js buﬀers? Node.js Interview Questions In general, buﬀers is a temporary memory that is mainly used by stream to hold on to some data until consumed. Buﬀers are introduced with additional use cases than JavaScript’s Unit8Array and are mainly used to represent a fixed-length sequence of bytes. This also supports legacy encodings like ASCII, utf-8, etc. It is a fixed(non- resizable) allocated memory outside the v8."
"24. What is middleware? Middleware comes in between your request and business logic. It is mainly used to capture logs and enable rate limit, routing, authentication, basically whatever that is not a part of business logic. There are third-party middleware also such as body- parser and you can write your own middleware for a specific use case."
"25. Explain what a Reactor Pattern in Node.js? Reactor pattern again a pattern for nonblocking I/O operations. But in general, this is used in any event-driven architecture. There are two components in this: 1. Reactor 2. Handler. Reactor: Its job is to dispatch the I/O event to appropriate handlers Handler: Its job is to actually work on those events"
"26. Why should you separate Express app and server? The server is responsible for initializing the routes, middleware, and other application logic whereas the app has all the business logic which will be served by the routes initiated by the server. This ensures that the business logic is encapsulated and decoupled from the application logic which makes the project more readable and maintainable."
"27. For Node.js, why Google uses V8 engine? Well, are there any other options available? Yes, of course, we have Spidermonkey from Firefox, Chakra from Edge but Google’s v8 is the most evolved(since it’s open- source so there’s a huge community helping in developing features and fixing bugs) and fastest(since it’s written in c++) we got till now as a JavaScript and WebAssembly engine. And it is portable to almost every machine known. Node.js Interview Questions"
28. Describe the exit codes of Node.js? Exit codes give us an idea of how a process got terminated/the reason behind termination. A few of them are: Uncaught fatal exception - (code - 1) - There has been an exception that is not handled Unused - (code - 2) - This is reserved by bash Fatal Error - (code - 5) - There has been an error in V8 with stderr output of the description Internal Exception handler Run-time failure - (code - 7) - There has been an exception when bootstrapping function was called Internal JavaScript Evaluation Failure - (code - 4) - There has been an exception when the bootstrapping process failed to return function value when evaluated.
"29. Explain the concept of stub in Node.js? Stubs are used in writing tests which are an important part of development. It replaces the whole function which is getting tested. This helps in scenarios where we need to test: External calls which make tests slow and diﬀicult to write (e.g HTTP calls/ DB calls) Triggering diﬀerent outcomes for a piece of code (e.g. what happens if an error is thrown/ if it passes) For example, this is the function: Node.js Interview Questions const request = require('request'); const getPhotosByAlbumId = (id) => { const requestUrl = `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/albums/${id}/photos?_limit=3`; return new Promise((resolve, reject) => { request.get(requestUrl, (err, res, body) => { if (err) { return reject(err); } resolve(JSON.parse(body)); }); }); }; module.exports = getPhotosByAlbumId; To test this function this is the stub const expect = require('chai').expect; const request = require('request'); const sinon = require('sinon'); const getPhotosByAlbumId = require('./index'); describe('with Stub: getPhotosByAlbumId', () => { before(() => { sinon.stub(request, 'get') .yields(null, null, JSON.stringify([ { ""albumId"": 1, ""id"": 1, ""title"": ""A real photo 1"", ""url"": ""https://via.placeholder.com/600/92c952"", ""thumbnailUrl"": ""https://via.placeholder.com/150/92c952"" }, { ""albumId"": 1, ""id"": 2, ""title"": ""A real photo 2"", ""url"": ""https://via.placeholder.com/600/771796"", ""thumbnailUrl"": ""https://via.placeholder.com/150/771796"" }, { ""albumId"": 1, ""id"": 3, ""title"": ""A real photo 3"", ""url"": ""https://via.placeholder.com/600/24f355"", ""thumbnailUrl"": ""https://via.placeholder.com/150/24f355"" } ])); }); after(() => { request.get.restore(); }); it('should getPhotosByAlbumId', (done) => { getPhotosByAlbumId(1).then((photos) => { expect(photos.length).to.equal(3); photos.forEach(photo => { expect(photo).to.have.property('id'); expect(photo).to.have.property('title'); expect(photo).to.have.property('url'); }); done(); }) Node.js Interview Questions Advanced Node.js Interview Questions"
"30. What is an Event Emitter in Node.js? EventEmitter is a Node.js class that includes all the objects that are basically capable of emitting events. This can be done by attaching named events that are emitted by the object using an eventEmitter.on() function. Thus whenever this object throws an even the attached functions are invoked synchronously. const EventEmitter = require('events'); class MyEmitter extends EventEmitter {} const myEmitter = new MyEmitter(); myEmitter.on('event', () => { console.log('an event occurred!'); }); myEmitter.emit('event');"
"31. Enhancing Node.js performance through clustering. Node.js applications run on a single processor, which means that by default they don’t take advantage of a multiple-core system. Cluster mode is used to start up multiple node.js processes thereby having multiple instances of the event loop. When we start using cluster in a nodejs app behind the scene multiple node.js processes are created but there is also a parent process called the cluster manager which is responsible for monitoring the health of the individual instances of our application. Node.js Interview Questions Clustering in Node.js"
"32. What is a thread pool and which library handles it in Node.js The Thread pool is handled by the libuv library. libuv is a multi-platform C library that provides support for asynchronous I/O-based operations such as file systems, networking, and concurrency. Thread Pool"
33. What is WASI and why is it being introduced? Node.js Interview Questions Web assembly provides an implementation of WebAssembly System Interface specification through WASI API in node.js implemented using WASI class. The introduction of WASI was done by keeping in mind its possible to use the underlying operating system via a collection of POSIX-like functions thus further enabling the application to use resources more eﬀiciently and features that require system-level access.
"34. How are worker threads diﬀerent from clusters? Cluster: There is one process on each CPU with an IPC to communicate. In case we want to have multiple servers accepting HTTP requests via a single port, clusters can be helpful. The processes are spawned in each CPU thus will have separate memory and node instance which further will lead to memory issues. Worker threads: There is only one process in total with multiple threads. Each thread has one Node instance (one event loop, one JS engine) with most of the APIs accessible. Shares memory with other threads (e.g. SharedArrayBuﬀer) This can be used for CPU-intensive tasks like processing data or accessing the file system since NodeJS is single-threaded, synchronous tasks can be made more eﬀicient leveraging the worker's threads."
"35. How to measure the duration of async operations? Performance API provides us with tools to figure out the necessary performance metrics. A simple example would be using async_hooks and perf_hooks Node.js Interview Questions 'use strict'; const async_hooks = require('async_hooks'); const { performance, PerformanceObserver } = require('perf_hooks'); const set = new Set(); const hook = async_hooks.createHook({ init(id, type) { if (type === 'Timeout') { performance.mark(`Timeout-${id}-Init`); set.add(id); } }, destroy(id) { if (set.has(id)) { set.delete(id); performance.mark(`Timeout-${id}-Destroy`); performance.measure(`Timeout-${id}`, `Timeout-${id}-Init`, `Timeout-${id}-Destroy`); } } }); hook.enable(); const obs = new PerformanceObserver((list, observer) => { console.log(list.getEntries()[0]); performance.clearMarks(); observer.disconnect(); }); obs.observe({ entryTypes: ['measure'], buffered: true }); setTimeout(() => {}, 1000); This would give us the exact time it took to execute the callback."
"Statistics Interview Questions The central limit theorem is extremely useful in estimating confidence intervals and testing hypotheses. For instance, let's say I want to estimate the worldwide average height. I would take a sample of people from the general population and calculate the mean. Because it is diﬀicult or impossible to collect data on every person's height, the mean of my sample will serve as my estimate. To create a normal curve, we can plot the mean value and the frequency on a graph and then multiply them several times. The resulting curve will be similar to the original data set, but it will be slightly shi"
"3. What is a hypothesis test? How is the statistical significance of an insight determined? The statistical significance of an experiment's insights can be assessed using hypothesis testing. Hypothesis testing examines the probability of a given experiment's results occurring by chance. The null hypothesis is defined first, and then p-values are computed. If the null hypothesis is true, other values are determined as well. As its name suggests, the alpha value indicates the degree of significance. In a two-tailed test, the p-value is less than alpha if the null hypothesis is rejected but is greater than alpha if the null hypothesis is accepted. In a one-tailed test, the p- value is less than alpha if the null hypothesis is accepted but is greater than alpha if the null hypothesis is rejected. The rejection of the null hypothesis indicates that the results obtained are statistically significant."
"4. Why are statistical data referred to as observational and experimental? Correlations between variables can be discovered through the collection of observational data. To determine the cause or eﬀect of a particular variable, experimental data is collected from those experiments where it is kept constant."
5. What is the definition of an inlier? Statistics Interview Questions An error instance is usually identified as an Inliner within a data set. It is usually a lower-level data point and should therefore be removed. Finding inliers is usually diﬀicult and requires outside data to identify.
"6. What is the Six sigma in statistic? In quality control, an error-free data set is generated using six sigma statistics. σ is known as standard deviation. The lower the standard deviation, the less likely that a process performs accurately and commits errors. If a process delivers 99.99966% error-free results, it is said to be six sigma. A six sigma model is one that outperforms 1σ, 2σ, 3σ, 4σ, and 5σ processes and is suﬀiciently reliable to deliver defect-free work."
"7. What does KPI stand for in statistics? A KPI is a quantifiable measure to evaluate whether the objectives are being met or not. It is a reliable metric to measure the performance level of an organisation or individual. An example of a KPI in an organisation such as the expense ratio. In terms of performance, KPIs are an eﬀective way of measuring whether an organisation or individual is meeting expectations."
8. Why is the Pareto principle famous? The Pareto principle states that 80% of the eﬀects or results in an experiment come from 20% of the causes. The Pareto principle is o
"9. What are the characteristics of large numbers in statistics? When the number of trials in an experiment increases, the results will approach the expected value in a desirable proportion because of the law of large numbers. To determine the probability of rolling a six-sided die three times, we can use this example. The outcome is far from the expected value, and if we roll the die a large number of times, we will more likely obtain our desired result closer to the expected value (3.5 in this instance). Statistics Interview Questions"
"10. What do you think of the phrase ‘p-value’? It is a number that helps determine the probability of a random occurrence when evaluating a hypothesis. In statistics, the p-value indicates how likely it is that a particular dataset occurred by chance. If the p-value is less than alpha, we can conclude that there is a probability of 5% that the experiment results occurred by chance or 5% of the time, we would see these results."
"11. What are cherry-picking, P-hacking, and significance chasing? Cherry-picking is the act of exclusively taking the bits of information that support a particular conclusion and ignoring all the bits of information that contradict it. P-hacking, also known as data collection or analysis manipulation, is a technique that produces significant patterns even though they have no underlying eﬀect. Reporting insignificant results as if they are almost significant, is known as Significance Chasing. Data Dredging, Data Fishing, and Data Snooping are all names for this behaviour."
"12. What is the diﬀerence between an error of type I and an error of type II? When the null hypothesis is rejected even though it is correct, a type 1 error occurs. False positives are also known as type 1 errors. When the null hypothesis is not rejected despite being incorrect, a type 2 error occurs. This is also known as a false negative."
"13. How does one define statistical interaction? When an input variable influences an output variable, a statistical interaction occurs. In real life, for example, the interaction of adding sugar to the stirring of tea is an example of statistical interaction. Neither of the variables has an impact on sweetness, but the two variables combine to produce sweetness. Statistics Interview Questions"

"15. How does linear regression work? When utilised in statistics, linear regression is a technique that models the relationship between one or more predictor variables and one outcome variable. For example, linear regression may be used to study the connection between various predictors, such as age, gender, heredity, diet, and height."
16. What are the necessary conditions for a Binomial Distribution? The three most important characteristics of a Binomial Distribution are listed below.
"1. The number of observations must be prearranged. In other words, one can only determine the probability of an event happening a specific number of times if a fixed number of trials are performed."
2. It is important that each trial is independent of the others. This means that the probability of each subsequent trial should not be aﬀected by previous trials.
3. The chance of getting the job remains the same no matter how many times you try.
"17. What is the diﬀerence between a sample and a population? The subset of the population from which numbers are obtained is known as the sample. The numbers obtained from the population are known as parameters, while the numbers obtained from the sample are known as statistics. It is through sample data that conclusions may be made about the population. Statistics Interview Questions Population Sample A parameter is an observable quality that can be measured.Statistics is an observable quality that can be measured. Every element of the population is a unique individual.A subset of the population is used to explore some aspects of the population. An opinion report is a true representation of what happened.The reported values have a confidence level and an error margin. All members of a group are included in the list.A particular portion of the population is represented by that subset."

Scale and Continuous are sometimes used to describe Interval and Ratio levels of measurement, respectively. Statistics Interview Questions"
"19. What is the diﬀerence between Descriptive and Inferential Statistics? Descriptive Inferential Describe the data in terms of its key characteristics.To conclude the population, it is used. Data can be organised, analysed, and presented in a meaningful way thanks to charts.The purpose of data analysis is to compare data and make predictions through hypotheses. Using charts, tables, and graphs to present information.Probability was responsible for achieving this goal."
"20. What are the diﬀerences between Data Science and Statistics? Statistics Interview Questions Data Science, which is a scientific discipline that employs data, includes interdisciplinary methods, algorithms, and even the procedure for extracting data knowledge. The data can be either coded or uncoerced. Data mining and data science are similar because both provide abstract data from a large amount of data. Data science now includes computer science, mathematical statistics, and computer science and behavioural applications. Data science, which integrates data analysis, understanding, organization, and communication together, produces insights and knowledge from a large amount of data by combining statistical analysis, visualization, and applied mathematical economics. The collection, analysis, interpretation, organization, and presentation of data are the main components of data science. The points listed below provide information on the diﬀerences between data science and statistics: Statistics Interview Questions On Comparison Data Science Statistics Definition A branch of scientific techniques that is related to disciplines other than science. Data mining involves processes, algorithms, and systems, too. To obtain information from data, use structured or unstructured data.A set of operations for dealing with data is provided.

"21. What is sampling? Selecting an unbiased or random subset of individual observations in a population is regarded as part of the statistical practice of sampling. In order to obtain some understanding of the population, sampling is used."
"22. How do you determine the statistical significance of an insight? The p-value is used to determine whether the null hypothesis is true or false. To put it another way, the null hypothesis states that there is no diﬀerence between the conditions, and the alternate hypothesis states that there is a diﬀerence. The p-value is then calculated. Once the p-value has been calculated, the null hypothesis is accepted and the sample values are determined. The alpha value, which indicates the significance of the result, is adjusted to fine-tune the result. If the p-value is lower than the alpha, the null hypothesis is rejected and the result is statistically significant."
23. How does the central limit theorem work? A stable distribution is one whose parameters change only slightly when the sample size changes. The central limit theorem says that a normal distribution is a result when the sample size is unchanged and the population shape doesn't change. The central limit theorem is crucial because it provides us with the correct formula for calculating confidence intervals. It is also used to test hypotheses correctly.
"24. How do you define exploratory data analysis? The goal of an exploratory data analysis is to better understand data by conducting investigations on it. During this stage, patterns are detected, hypotheses are tested, anomalies are spotted, and the foundation for the research is established."
"25. What is the definition of selection bias? Statistics Interview Questions The process of selecting individual or group data in a way that is not random is known as selection bias. Randomization is crucial in evaluating model functionality and performing analysis. Therefore, if incorrect randomization is not avoided, the obtained sample will not accurately represent the population."
"26. What does it mean by inlier? Finding an inlier in a dataset is more challenging than finding an outlier. Because finding an inlier requires external data, model accuracy is o"
27. What are the applications of long-tailed distributions? The part of the curve that extends to the end is known as a long tail. It gradually gets smaller towards the end of the curve. The long-tailed distribution is used to demonstrate the Pareto principle and the product sales distribution in these examples. It is also utilised in classification and regression problems.
"28. In what situation would the median be a more suitable measure compared to the mean? In situations where outliers can aﬀect data in either a positive or negative manner, the median is preferable due to its ability to accurately gauge this."
"29. How might root cause analysis be applied to a real-life situation? The technique of identifying the source of a problem by identifying the root cause is known as root cause analysis. Examples: A positive correlation between the higher crime rate in a city and the higher sales of red shirts can be inferred from the above sentence. However, this does not mean that one causes the other. Correlational and experimental approaches can always be used to test causation. Statistics Interview Questions"
30. How does the Design of Experiments in statistics work? The Design of Experiments in Statistics is an experimental design that defines an inquiry task that specifies how variable changes when another variable change. It is also known as the Design of Experiments.
"31. What does standard deviation mean? When a set of data points is near the mean, a low value of standard deviation indicates that the points are close to the mean, and a high value indicates that the points are far away from the mean. On the other hand, when the data points are far apart from each other, a high standard deviation indicates that the points are far away from the mean, and a low standard deviation indicates that the points are close to the mean."
32. What are the characteristics of a bell-curve distribution? The characteristic bell curve shape of a normal distribution is what gives it its name. We can perceive the bell curve as we look at the distribution.
"33. What is your definition of skewness? Skewed data distribution has a non-symmetrical pattern relative to the mean, the mode, and the median. The skewness of data indicates that there are significant diﬀerences between the mean, the mode, and the median. Data that is skewed cannot be used to create a normal distribution."
"34. How do you define kurtosis? Outliers are detected in a data distribution using kurtosis. It measures the extent to which the tail values diverge from the central portion of the distribution. The higher the kurtosis, the higher the number of outliers in the data. To reduce their eﬀect, we may either include more data or eliminate the outliers."
"35. What is the definition of correlation? Statistics Interview Questions The degree to which variables correlate is tested by covariance and correlation. In contrast to covariance, correlation indicates how closely linked two variables are. Values for correlation range from -1 to +1, with -1 indicating a strong negative correlation and +1 indicating a strong positive correlation. A high negative correlation, where if one variable increases, the other variable will decrease drastically, is represented by the -1 value. A positive correlation, where an increase in one variable will cause an increase in the other, is represented by the +1 value. There is no correlation between 0 and +1 variables, whereas 0 and -1 variables have a negative correlation. If the statistical model is aﬀected negatively by two variables that are strongly correlated, then one of them must be removed."

"37. How does the term covariance relate to understanding? When two items are associated in a random process, covariance is the measure of how closely they fluctuate together. Is there a connection between one of the variables in a random pair and the other variable? If there is, then the systematic connection is determined."
"38. How do you define Bessel's correction? Bessel’s correction corrects the flaw in using a sample to estimate a population standard deviation. It lowers the bias in the estimated standard deviation, resulting in more accurate measurements."

From government operations to quality control and quality assurance teams in multinational corporations, inferential statistics are used in a variety of fields."
40. How are mean and median related in a normal distribution? The mean and the median of a dataset are in agreement if the dataset’s distribution is normal. We can immediately tell if a dataset’s distribution is normal if we simply check its mean and median.
"41. What is the relationship between standard error and the margin of error? The margin of error is proportionally influenced by the standard error. In other words, the margin of error is computed using standard error. As standard error increases, the margin of error also rises."
"42. What does a degree of freedom (DF) represent in statistics? The t-distribution is used to calculate degrees of freedom and not the z-distribution. When speaking about degrees of freedom, we are referring to the number of options at our disposal when conducting an analysis. The t-distribution will shi"
"43. How do you explain the law of large numbers in statistics? Inference from statistical data can be said to follow the law of large numbers, which purports that, as the number of trials increases, the average result will increase in proportion to it. The percentage of heads obtained by repeatedly flipping a fair coin is lower the more times it is flipped, 100,000 times in this example."
44. How does TF/IDF vectorization relate to meaning? A numerical value representing the importance of a word in a document is referred to as TF-IDF. It is measured using the Term Frequency – Inverse Document Frequency Statistics Interview Questions The phrase frequency-inverse document frequency value is directly proportional to the number of times a word appears in a document. Text mining and information retrieval are mainly dependent on phrase frequency-inverse document frequency values.
"45. What is the purpose of Hash tables in statistics? When key-value pairs are stored in a hash table, the information regarding keys and associated values are stored in a hierarchical fashion using hash tables. The hashing function is used to provide an index that contains all of the information regarding keys and their associated values."
"46. Symmetric distributions need to be unimodal, does it? Bi- or multi-modal symmetric distributions do not have to have only one mode or value that occurs most frequently, nor do they have to be unimodal (having only one mode or value that occurs most frequently)."
"47. Is there any significance to outliers in statistics? Outliers have a significant detrimental impact on the calculation of any statistical query result. For example, if we seek to compute the mean of a dataset that contains outliers, we will get a diﬀerent result than the actual mean (i.e., the mean we would get a"

"2. Median: The median is the value located in the middle when the data is ordered (e.g. ordered in ascending or descending order). If n values are provided (such as x1, x2, x3,……xn), then the median is x ƪ = { x1, x2, x3,……xn } . If n is odd, the case is I. If n is even, the case is II. Statistics Interview Questions"
"3. Mode: In the dataset, there may be more than one value that is the mode. Therefore, the mode is the most frequent value."
"49. How do you define Normal Distribution? The mean of a Normal Distribution is located symmetrically about the distribution's centre. It is also known as a Gaussian Distribution. A symmetric curve resembles a bell, with the most frequent data occurring at the centre (see the figure). Statistics Interview Questions"
"Linked List Interview Questions A linked list is a dynamic data structure that can grow and shrink in size at runtime by allocating and deallocating memory. As a result, there is no need to specify the linked list's initial size. There is no memory wastage in the linked list since the size of the linked list increases or decreases at run time, hence there is no memory wastage and no need to pre-allocate memory. A linked list is frequently used to build linear data structures such as stacks and queues. The linked list makes it much easier to insert and delete items. A"

"1. How will you find the middle element of a singly linked list without iterating the list more than once? To solve this problem, we can use the two-pointer method. You have two pointers, one fast and one slow, in the two-pointer approach. The fast pointer travels two nodes per step, while the slow pointer only moves one. The slow pointer will point to the middle node of the linked list when the fast pointer points to the last node, i.e. when the next node is null. Node* getMiddle(Node *head) { struct Node *slow = head; struct Node *fast = head; if (head) { while (fast != NULL && fast->next != NULL) { fast = fast->next->next; slow = slow->next; } } return slow; } Time Complexity: O(n) Space Complexity: O(1)"

"4. What algorithm will you implement to find similar elements from two Linked Lists given and return the result in the form of a Linked List? Assume there are no duplicates. Create an empty hash table and set the result list to NULL. While traversing List1, insert the element in the hash table for each element visited in List1. While traversing List2, look for the entries in the hash table for each element visited in List2. If the element is already existing, add it to the result list. If the element isn't present, it is to be ignored. Linked List Interview Questions The overall time and space complexity are linear. Node* getIntersection(Node* head1, Node* head2) { unordered_map < int > m; Node* n1 = head1; Node* n2 = head2; Node* head = NULL; // loop stores all the elements of list1 in hset while (n1) { m[n1->value] = 1; n1 = n1->next; } // For every element of list2 present in hset // loop inserts the element into the result while (n2 != null) { if (m[n2->value] == 1) { Node* temp = new Node(); temp->value = n2->value; temp->next = head; head = temp; } n2 = n2->next; } return head; }"
"5. Why is merge sort a better option than quicksort for linked lists? Linked List Interview Questions When it comes to linked lists, there are a few things to keep in mind. The issue is unique due to the memory allocation diﬀerences between arrays and linked lists. Unlike arrays, linked list nodes in memory may not be adjacent. We can insert items in the middle of a linked list in O(1) extra space and O(1) time if we are given a reference/pointer to the previous node, unlike an array. As a result, the merge sort operation can be accomplished without the need for additional linked list space. We can do random access in arrays since the elements are continuous in memory. In contrast to arrays, we can't access a linked list at random. Quick Sort necessitates a great deal of this type of access. Because we don't have a continuous block of memory, we have to travel from the head to the i'th node to get to the i'th index in a linked list. Merge sort accesses data in a sequential manner, with less requirement for random access."
"6. Write a program to delete all odd positioned nodes from a circular linked list. (Consider 1-based indexing). Linked List Interview Questions The approach is to begin traversing the circular linked list by keeping track of the current node's position using a count variable. Delete the current node if it is at an odd position. Implementation: Linked List Interview Questions // l is the length of the linked list void DeleteAllOddNodes(struct Node** head_reference, int l) { int cnt = 0; struct Node *prev = *head_reference, *next = *head_reference; // check if the list is empty if (*head_reference == NULL) { cout<<""List is empty""<<endl; return; } // check if there is a single node in the list if (l == 1) { // Function to delete first node *head_reference=NULL; return; } while (l > 0) { // delete first position node as it is odd if (cnt == 0) { struct Node *t1 = *head_reference, *t2 = *head_reference; if (t1->next == t1) { *head_reference = NULL; } while(t1->next!=*head_reference) { t1 = t1->next; t2 = t1->next; } t1->next = t2->next; *head_reference = t1->next; free(t2); } // if the position is odd, delete that node if (cnt % 2 == 0 && cnt != 0) { struct Node* tmp = head_reference; if (head_reference == prev) { head_reference = prev->next; } while (tmp->next != prev) { tmp = tmp->next; } tmp->next = prev->next; free(prev); } Linked List Interview Questions Time Complexity: O(n^2) Space Complexity: O(1)"

"9. The task is to determine pairs in a doubly-linked list whose sum equals the provided value ‘val’ without consuming any extra space for a given sorted doubly-linked list of positive distinct entries. The expected complexities are O(n) time and O(1) space. The approach is as follows: Two pointer variables are to be initialized to find the possible elements in the sorted doubly linked list. Initialize num1 with the head of the doubly linked list,i.e., num1=head, and num2 with the last node of the doubly linked list, i.e., num2=lastNode. If the current sum of num1 and num2 is less than Val, then we advance num1 in the forward direction. If the current total of the num1 and num2 is greater than x, then num2 is moved in the backward direction. When the two pointers cross each other (num2->next = num1) or they become equal (num1 == num2), the loop ends. The condition ""num1==num2"" will handle the circumstance where no such pairs are present. Implementation: Linked List Interview Questions vector<pair<int,int>> sumPair(struct Node *head, int val) { // Two pointers are to be set, one to the beginning // and the other to the last of the DLL. struct Node *num1 = head; struct Node *num2 = head; while (num2->next != NULL) //to get to the last node num2 = num2->next; vector<pair<int,int>> ans; // The loop ends when two pointers // cross each other or they are equal while (num1 != num2 && num2->next != num1) { if ((num1->value + num2->value) == val) { ans.push_back(make_pair(num1->value,num2->value)); // move num1 in the forward direction num1 = num1->next; // move num2 in the backward direction num2 = num2->prev; } else { if ((num1->value + num2->value) > val) num2 = num2->prev; else num1 = num1->next; } } return ans; } Time Complexity: O(n) Space Complexity: O(1)"

"12. How will you modify a linked list of integers so that all even numbers appear before all odd numbers in the modified linked list? Also, keep the even and odd numbers in the same order. Example: Input: 17->15->8->12->10->5->4->1->7->6->NULL Output: 8->12->10->4->6->17->15->5->1->7->NULL Algorithm: The approach is to divide the linked list into two sections, one with all even nodes and the other with all odd nodes. In order to split the Linked List, traverse the original Linked List and move all odd nodes to a new Linked List. The original list will include all the even nodes at the end of the loop, while the odd node list will have all the odd nodes. We must place all the odd nodes at the end of the odd node list to maintain the same ordering of all nodes. And, in order to do it in real-time, we'll need to maintain track of the last pointer in the odd node list. Finally, the odd node linked list is to be attached a"
"13. Given a linked list and a number n, you have to find the sum of the last n nodes of the linked list in a single traversal. Explain your approach in brief. The use of two-pointers will require a single traversal. We will have to maintain two pointers – reference pointer and main pointer. Both these pointers will be initialized to head. First, the reference pointer will be moved to n nodes from the head, and while traversing, we will keep adding the values and store them into a variable called sum1. Now both the pointers will move simultaneously until the reference pointer reaches the end of the list and while traversing, we will keep adding the values of the nodes. The reference pointer is storing this sum in the variable sum1, and the main pointer will be storing it in sum2. Now, (sum1 – sum2) is the answer, that is the required sum of the last n nodes. Linked List Interview Questions int getSum(Node* head, int n) { if (n <= 0) return 0; int sum1 = 0, sum2 = 0; struct Node* ptr1 = head; struct Node* ptr2 = head; // the sum of the first n nodes is to be calculated for (ptr1 = head; ptr1 != NULL; ptr1 = ptr1->next;) { sum += ptr1->value; n--; if(n == 0) break; } // now there is a distance of n nodes between the two pointers // move to the end of the linked list while (ptr1 != NULL) { // sum of all the nodes sum1 += ptr1->value; // sum of the first length - n nodes sum2 += ptr2->value; ptr1 = ptr2->next; ptr2 = ptr2->next; } // returning the required sum return (sum1 - sum2); } Time Complexity is O(n) and space complexity is O(1)."

"15. How will you find the length of a linked list which contains a cycle? The algorithm to determine the length of the list: Linked List Interview Questions At a time, pointer A advances one node while pointer B advances two nodes. Starting from the head, they move until B reaches null (no loop) or A and B refer to the same node. Now, if A simply advances, A will run into B again. The length of the loop, let's call it x, may be calculated from this. Begin again from the head, but this time have a pointer C which has moved x nodes, followed by a pointer D behind it. Both will move one node further at a time. When they meet, the length of the linked list with a loop is equal to the number of nodes traversed by D plus x. Linked List Interview Questions int calcLen( Node* head ) { struct Node *A = head, *B = head; while ( A && B && B->next ) { A = A->next; B = B->next->next; /* If slow_p and fast_p meet at some point then there is a loop */ if (A == B) { int x = 1; struct Node *t = A; while (t->next != A) { x++; t = t->next; } } } struct Node *C = head, *D = head; int y = 0; for ( int i = 0; i < x; i++ ) { C = C->next; } while( C != D ) { y++; C = C->next; D = D->next; } return x+y; } Time Complexity: O(n) Space Complexity: O(1)"

Here, all of the merge sort methods are altered to work with arbit pointers rather than the next pointers. Linked List Interview Questions"
"21. In a standard Doubly Linked List, two address fields are required to contain the addresses of previous and next nodes. Can you create a doubly linked list using only one space for the address field with every node? Yes, there is a memory-saving version of the Doubly Linked List that uses only one space for the address field in each node. Because the list uses the bitwise XOR operation to save space for one address, it is known as the XOR Linked List or Memory Eﬀicient. Instead of storing actual memory addresses, each node in the XOR linked list stores the XOR of previous and next node addresses. In the XOR representation, let's call the address variable npx (XOR of next and previous). We can traverse the XOR Linked List in both forward and reverse directions while traversing it. We must remember the address of the previously visited node when traversing the list in order to determine the address of the next node. Node W: npx = 0 XOR add(X) Node X: npx = add(W) XOR add(Y) Node Y: npx = add(X) XOR add(Z) Node Z: npx = add(Y) XOR 0 Calculation: npx(Y) XOR add(X) => (add(X) XOR add(Z)) XOR add(X) // npx(Y) = add(X) XOR add(Z) => add(X) XOR add(Z) XOR add(X) // w ^x = w^x and (w^x)^y = w^(x^y) => add(Z) XOR 0 // x ^x = 0 => add(Z) // x ^0 = x Linked List Interview Questions"

"1. Explain Django Architecture? Django follows the MVT (Model View Template) pattern which is based on the Model View Controller architecture. It’s slightly diﬀerent from the MVC pattern as it maintains its own conventions, so, the controller is handled by the framework itself. The template is a presentation layer. It is an HTML file mixed with Django Template Language (DTL). The developer provides the model, the view, and the template then maps it to a URL, and finally, Django serves it to the user. Django Interview Questions"
2. Explain the django project directory structure? manage.py - A command-line utility that allows you to interact with your Django project __init__.py - An empty file that tells Python that the current directory should be considered as a Python package settings.py - Comprises the configurations of the current project like DB connections. urls.py - All the URLs of the project are present here wsgi.py - This is an entry point for your application which is used by the web servers to serve the project you have created.
"3. What are models in Django? A model in Django refers to a class that maps to a database table or database collection. Each attribute of the Django model class represents a database field. They are defined in app/models.py Example: Django Interview Questions from django.db import models class SampleModel(models.Model): field1 = models.CharField(max_length = 50) field2 = models.IntegerField() class Meta: db_table = “sample_model” Every model inherits from django.db.models.Model Our example has 2 attributes (1 char and 1 integer field), those will be in the table fields. The metaclass helps you set things like available permissions, singular and plural versions of the name, associated database table name, whether the model is abstract or not, etc. To get more information about models you can refer here: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/db/models/."
"4. What are templates in Django or Django template language? Templates are an integral part of the Django MVT architecture. They generally comprise HTML, CSS, and js in which dynamic variables and information are embedded with the help of views. Some constructs are recognized and interpreted by the template engine. The main ones are variables and tags. A template is rendered with a context. Rendering just replaces variables with their values, present in the context, and processes tags. Everything else remains as it is. The syntax of the Django template language includes the following four constructs : Variables Tags Filters Comments To read more about templates you can refer to this: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/templates/ Django Interview Questions"
"5. What are views in Django? A view function, or “view” for short, is simply a Python function that takes a web request and returns a web response. This response can be HTML contents of a web page, or a redirect, or a 404 error, or an XML document, or an image, etc. Example: from django.http import HttpResponse def sample_function(request): return HttpResponse(“Welcome to Django”) There are two types of views: Function-Based Views: In this, we import our view as a function. Class-based Views: It’s an object-oriented approach."
"6. What is Django ORM? This ORM (an acronym for Object Relational Mapper) enables us to interact with databases in a more pythonic way like we can avoid writing raw queries, it is possible to retrieve, save, delete and perform other operations over the database without ever writing any SQL query. It works as an abstraction layer between the models and the database."
"7. Define static files and explain their uses? Websites generally need to serve additional files such as images. Javascript or CSS. In Django, these files are referred to as “static files”, Apart from that Django provides django.contrib.staticfiles to manage these static files."
8. What is Django Rest Framework(DRF)? Django Rest Framework is an open-source framework based upon Django which lets you create RESTful APIs rapidly.
"9. What is django-admin and manage.py and explain its commands? Django Interview Questions django-admin is Django’s command-line utility for administrative tasks. In addition to this, a manage.py file is also automatically created in each Django project. Not only does it perform the same purpose as the django-admin but it also sets the DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE environment variable to point to the project's settings.py file. Django Interview Questions django-admin help - used to display usage information and a list of the commands provided by each application. django-admin version - used to check your Django version. django-admin check - used to inspect the entire Django project for common problems. django-admin compilemessages - Compiles .po files created by makemessages to .mo files for use with the help of built-in gettext support. django-admin createcachetable - Creates the cache tables for use in the database cache backend. django-admin dbshell - Runs the command-line client for the database engine specified in your ENGINE setting(s), with the connection parameters (USER, PASSWORD, DB_NAME, USER etc.) specified settings file. django-admin diﬀsettings - Shows the diﬀerence between the existing settings file and Django’s default settings. django-admin dumpdata - Used to the dumpdata from the database. django-admin flush - Flush all values from the database and also re-executes any post-synchronization handlers specified in the code. django-admin inspectdb - It generates django models from the existing database tables. django-admin loaddata - loads the data into the database from the fixture file. django-admin makemessages - Used for translation purpose and it generates a message file too. django-admin makemigrations - Generates new migrations as per the changes detected to your models. django-admin migrate - Executes SQL commands a"
"10. What is Jinja templating? Jinja Templating is a very popular templating engine for Python, the latest version is Jinja2. Some of its features are: Sandbox Execution - This is a sandbox (or a protected) framework for automating the testing process HTML Escaping - It provides automatic HTML Escaping as <, >, & characters have special values in templates and if using a regular text, these symbols can lead to XSS Attacks which Jinja deals with automatically. Template Inheritance Generates HTML templates much faster than default engine Easier to debug as compared to the default engine."
"11. What are Django URLs? URLs are one of the most important parts of a web application and Django provides you with an elegant way to design your own custom URLs with help of its module known as URLconf (URL Configuration). The basic functionality of this python module is to You can design your own URLs in Django in the way you like and then map them to the python function (View function). These URLs can be static as well as dynamic. These URLs as present in the urls.py where they are matched with the equivalent view function. Basic Syntax: from django.urls import path from . import views urlpatterns = [ path('data/2020/', views.data_2020), path('data/<int:year>/', views.data_year) ]"
"12. What is the diﬀerence between a project and an app in Django? Django Interview Questions In simple words Project is the entire Django application and an app is a module inside the project that deals with one specific use case. For eg, payment system(app) in the eCommerce app(Project)."
13. What are diﬀerent model inheritance styles in the Django? Abstract Base Class Inheritance: Used when you only need the parent class to hold information that you don’t want to write for each child model. Multi-Table Model Inheritance: Used when you are subclassing an existing model and need each model to have its own table in the database. Proxy Model Inheritance: Used when you want to retain the model's field while altering the python level functioning of the model. Intermediate Django Interview Questions

The signals are the utilities that allow us to associate events with actions. We can implement these by developing a function that will run when a signal calls it. List of built-in signals in the models: Django Interview Questions Signals Description django.db.models.pre_init & django.db.models.post_initSent before or a"
"15. Explain the caching strategies in the Django? Django Interview Questions Caching refers to the technique of storing the output results when they are processed initially so that next time when the same results are fetched again, instead of processing again those already stored results can be used, which leads to faster accessing as well us less resource utilization. Django provides us with a robust cache system that is able to store dynamic web pages so that these pages don’t need to be evaluated again for each request. Some of the caching strategies in Django are listed below: Strategy Description MemcachedA memory-based cache server is the fastest and most eﬀicient FileSystem CachingValues of the cache are stored as separate files in a serialized order Local- memory CachingThis is used as the default cache strategy by Django if you haven’t set anything. It is per- process as well as thread-safe. Database Caching Cache data will be stored in the database and works very well if you have a fast and well- indexed DB server."
"16. Explain user authentication in Django? Django comes with a built-in user authentication system, which handles objects like users, groups, user-permissions, and few cookie-based user sessions. Django User authentication not only authenticates the user but also authorizes him. The system consists and operates on these objects: Django Interview Questions Users Permissions Groups Password Hashing System Forms Validation A pluggable backend system"
"17. How to configure static files? Ensure that django.contrib.staticfiles is added to your INSTALLED_APPS In your settings file. define STATIC_URL for ex. STATIC_URL = '/static/' In your Django templates, use the static template tag to create the URL for the given relative path using the configured STATICFILES_STORAGE. {% load static %} <img src=""{% static 'my_sample/abcxy.jpg' %}"" alt=""ABC image""> Store your static files in a folder called static in your app. For example my_sample/static/my_sample/abcxy.jpg"
"18. Explain Django Response lifecycle? Whenever a request is made to a web page, Django creates an HttpRequest object that contains metadata about the request. A"
1. First of the Django settings.py file is loaded which also contain various middleware classes (MIDDLEWARES)
2. The middlewares are also executed in the order in which they are mentioned in the MIDDLEWAREST
"3. From here on the request is now moved to the URL Router, who simply gets the URL path from the request and tries to map with our given URL paths in the urls.py."
"4. As soon as it has mapped, it will call the equivalent view function, from where an equivalent response is generated"
5. The response also passes through the response middlewares and send back to the client/browser.
"19. What databases are supported by Django? PostgreSQL and MySQL, SQLite and Oracle. Apart from these, Django also supports databases such as ODBC, Microso"
"20. What's the use of a session framework? Using the session framework, you can easily store and retrieve arbitrary data based on the pre-site-visitors. It stores data on the server-side and takes care of the process of sending and receiving cookies. These cookies just consist of a session ID, not the actual data itself unless you explicitly use a cookie-based backend."
"21. What’s the use of Middleware in Django? Middleware is something that executes between the request and response. In simple words, you can say it acts as a bridge between the request and response. Similarly In Django when a request is made it moves through middlewares to views and data is passed through middleware as a response."
"22. What is context in the Django? Context is a dictionary mapping template variable name given to Python objects in Django. This is the general name, but you can give any other name of your choice if you want. Django Interview Questions"
"23. What is django.shortcuts.render function? When a view function returns a webpage as HttpResponse instead of a simple string, we use render(). Render function is a shortcut function that lets the developer easily pass the data dictionary with the template. This function then combines the template with a data dictionary via templating engine. Finally, this render() returns as HttpResponse with the rendered text, which is the data returned by models. Thus, Django render() bypasses most of the developer’s work and lets him use diﬀerent template engines. The basic syntax: render(request, template_name, context=None, content_type=None, status=None, using=None) The request is the parameter that generates the response. The template name is the HTML template used, whereas the context is a dict of the data passed on the page from the python. You can also specify the content type, the status of the data you passed, and the render you are returning."
"24. What’s the significance of the settings.py file? As the name suggests this file stores the configurations or settings of our Django project, like database configuration, backend engines, middlewares, installed applications, main URL configurations, static file addresses, templating engines, main URL configurations, security keys, allowed hosts, and much more."
25. How to view all items in the Model? ModelName.objects.all()
26. How to filter items in the Model? ModelName.objects.filter(field_name=”term”) Advanced Django Interview Questions
"27. How to use file-based sessions? To use the same, you need to set the SESSION_ENGINE settings to ""django.contrib.sessions.backends.file"" Django Interview Questions Mixin is a type of multiple inheritances wherein you can combine behaviors and attributes of more than one parent class. It provides us with an excellent way to reuse code from multiple classes. One drawback of using these mixins is that it becomes diﬀicult to analyze what a class is doing and which methods to override in case of its code being too scattered between multiple classes."
"29. What is Django Field Class? 'Field' refers to an abstract class that represents a column in the database table. The Field class is just a subclass of RegisterLookupMixin. In Django, these fields are used to create database tables (db_types()) which are used to map Python types to the database using get_prep_value() and the other way round using from_db_value() method. Therefore, fields are fundamental pieces in diﬀerent Django APIs such as models and querysets."
30. Why is permanent redirection not a good option? Permanent redirection is used only when you don’t want to lead visitors to the old URLs. The response of the permanent redirections is cached by the browser so when you try to redirect to something else it will cause issues. Since this is a browser-side operation if your user wants to move to a new page it will load the same page.
"31. Diﬀerence between Django OneToOneField and ForeignKey Field? Both of them are of the most common types of fields used in Django. The only diﬀerence between these two is that ForeignKey field consists of on_delete option along with a model’s class because it’s used for many-to-one relationships while on the other hand, the OneToOneField, only carries out a one-to-one relationship and requires only the model’s class."
"32. How can you combine multiple QuerySets in a View? Initially, Concatenating QuerySets into lists is believed to be the easiest approach. Here’s an example of how to do that: from itertools import chain result_list = list(chain(model1_list, model2_list, model3_list)) Django Interview Questions"
"33. How to get a particular item in the Model? ModelName.objects.get(id=”term”) Note: If there are no results that match the query, get() will raise a DoesNotExist exception. If more than one item matches the given get() query. In this case, it’ll raise MultipleObjectsReturned, which is also an attribute of the model class itself."
34. How to obtain the SQL query from the queryset? print(queryset.query)
"35. What are the ways to customize the functionality of the Django admin interface? There are multiple ways to customize the functionality of the Django admin interface. You can piggyback on top of an add/change form that’s automatically generated by Django, you can add JavaScript modules using the js parameter. This parameter is basically a list of URLs that point to the JavaScript modules that are to be included in your project within a <script> tag. You can also write views for the admin if you want."
"36. Diﬀerence between select_related and prefetch_related? Though both the functions are used to fetch the related fields on a model but their functioning is bit diﬀerent from each other. In simple words, select_related uses a foreign key relationship, i.e. using join on the query itself while on the prefetch_related there is a separate lookup and the joining on the python side. Let’s try to illustrate this via an example: Django Interview Questions"
"37. Explain Q objects in Django ORM? Q objects are used to write complex queries, as in filter() functions just `AND` the conditions while if you want to `OR` the conditions you can use Q objects. Let’s see an example: from django.db import models from django.db.models import Q >> objects = Models.objects.get( Q(tag__startswith='Human'), Q(category=’Eyes’) | Q(category=’Nose’) ) ```Query Executed SELECT * FROM Model WHERE tag LIKE ‘Human%’ AND (category=’Eyes’ OR category=’Nose’) ```"
"Multithreading Interview Questions There are various benefits of multithreading as given below: Allow the program to run continuously even if a part of it is blocked. Improve performance as compared to traditional parallel programs that use multiple processes. Allows to write eﬀective programs that utilize maximum CPU time Improves the responsiveness of complex applications or programs. Increase use of CPU resources and reduce costs of maintenance. Saves time and parallelism tasks. If an exception occurs in a single thread, it will not aﬀect other threads as threads are independent. Less resource-intensive than executing multiple processes at the same time."
"2. What is Thread in Java? Threads are basically the lightweight and smallest unit of processing that can be managed independently by a scheduler. Threads are referred to as parts of a process that simply let a program execute eﬀiciently with other parts or threads of the process at the same time. Using threads, one can perform complicated tasks in the easiest way. It is considered the simplest way to take advantage of multiple CPUs available in a machine. They share the common address space and are independent of each other."
"3. What are the two ways of implementing thread in Java? There are basically two ways of implementing thread in java as given below: Implementing Runnable interface in Java Example: Multithreading Interview Questions class MultithreadingDemo extends Thread { public void run() { System.out.println(""My thread is in running state.""); } public static void main(String args[]) { MultithreadingDemoobj=new MultithreadingDemo(); obj.start(); } } Output: My thread is in running state. Extending the Thread class. Example: class MultithreadingDemo implements Runnable { public void run() { System.out.println(""My thread is in running state.""); } public static void main(String args[]) { MultithreadingDemo obj=new MultithreadingDemo(); Threadtobj =new Thread(obj); tobj.start(); } } Output: My thread is in running state."
"4. What's the diﬀerence between thread and process? Multithreading Interview Questions Thread: It simply refers to the smallest units of the particular process. It has the ability to execute diﬀerent parts (referred to as thread) of the program at the same time. Process: It simply refers to a program that is in execution i.e., an active program. A process can be handled using PCB (Process Control Block). Multithreading Interview Questions Thread Process It is a subset of a subunit of a process.It is a program in execution containing multiple threads. In this, inter-thread communication is faster, less expensive, easy and eﬀicient because threads share the same memory address of the process they belong to. In this, inter-process communication is slower, expensive, and complex because each process has diﬀerent memory space or address., These are easier to create, lightweight, and have less overhead. These are diﬀicult to create, heavyweight, and have more overhead. It requires less time for creation, termination, and context switching.It requires more time for creation, termination, and context switching. Processes with multiple threads use fewer resources.Processes without threads use more resources. Threads are parts of a process, so they are dependent on each other but each thread executes independently.Processes are independent of each other. There is a need for synchronization in threads to avoid unexpected scenarios or problems.There is no need for synchronization in each process. They share data and information with each other. They do not share data with each other. Multithreading Interview Questions"
"5. What’s the diﬀerence between class lock and object lock? Class Lock: In java, each and every class has a unique lock usually referred to as a class level lock. These locks are achieved using the keyword ‘static synchronized’ and can be used to make static data thread-safe. It is generally used when one wants to prevent multiple threads from entering a synchronized block. Example: public class ClassLevelLockExample { public void classLevelLockMethod() { synchronized (ClassLevelLockExample.class) { //DO your stuff here } } } Object Lock: In java, each and every object has a unique lock usually referred to as an object-level lock. These locks are achieved using the keyword ‘synchronized’ and can be used to protect non-static data. It is generally used when one wants to synchronize a non-static method or block so that only the thread will be able to execute the code block on a given instance of the class. Example: public class ObjectLevelLockExample { public void objectLevelLockMethod() { synchronized (this) { //DO your stuff here } } } Multithreading Interview Questions"
"6. What's the diﬀerence between User thread and Daemon thread? User and Daemon are basically two types of thread used in Java by using a ‘Thread Class’. User Thread (Non-Daemon Thread): In Java, user threads have a specific life cycle and its life is independent of any other thread. JVM (Java Virtual Machine) waits for any of the user threads to complete its tasks before terminating it. When user threads are finished, JVM terminates the whole program along with associated daemon threads. Daemon Thread: In Java, daemon threads are basically referred to as a service provider that provides services and support to user threads. There are basically two methods available in thread class for daemon thread: setDaemon() and isDaemon(). User Thread vs Daemon Thread Multithreading Interview Questions User Thread Daemon Thread JVM waits for user threads to finish their tasks before termination. JVM does not wait for daemon threads to finish their tasks before termination. These threads are normally created by the user for executing tasks concurrently. These threads are normally created by JVM. They are used for critical tasks or core work of an application. They are not used for any critical tasks but to do some supporting tasks. These threads are referred to as high- priority tasks, therefore are required for running in the foreground. These threads are referred to as low priority threads, therefore are especially required for supporting background tasks like garbage collection, releasing memory of unused objects, etc."
"7. How can we create daemon threads? Multithreading Interview Questions We can create daemon threads in java using the thread class setDaemon(true). It is used to mark the current thread as daemon thread or user thread. isDaemon() method is generally used to check whether the current thread is daemon or not. If the thread is a daemon, it will return true otherwise it returns false. Example: Program to illustrate the use of setDaemon() and isDaemon() method. public class DaemonThread extends Thread { public DaemonThread(String name){ super(name); } public void run() { // Checking whether the thread is Daemon or not if(Thread.currentThread().isDaemon()) { System.out.println(getName() + "" is Daemon thread""); } else { System.out.println(getName() + "" is User thread""); } } public static void main(String[] args) { DaemonThread t1 = new DaemonThread(""t1""); DaemonThread t2 = new DaemonThread(""t2""); DaemonThread t3 = new DaemonThread(""t3""); // Setting user thread t1 to Daemon t1.setDaemon(true); // starting first 2 threads t1.start(); t2.start(); // Setting user thread t3 to Daemon t3.setDaemon(true); t3.start(); } } Output: Multithreading Interview Questions t1 is Daemon thread t3 is Daemon thread t2 is User thread But one can only call the setDaemon() method before start() method otherwise it will definitely throw IllegalThreadStateException as shown below: public class DaemonThread extends Thread { public void run() { System.out.println(""Thread name: "" + Thread.currentThread().getName()); System.out.println(""Check if its DaemonThread: "" + Thread.currentThread().isDaemon()); } public static void main(String[] args) { DaemonThread t1 = new DaemonThread(); DaemonThread t2 = new DaemonThread(); t1.start(); // Exception as the thread is already started t1.setDaemon(true); t2.start(); } } Output: Thread name: Thread-0 Check if its DaemonThread: false"
"8. What are the wait() and sleep() methods? wait(): As the name suggests, it is a non-static method that causes the current thread to wait and go to sleep until some other threads call the notify () or notifyAll() method for the object’s monitor (lock). It simply releases the lock and is mostly used for inter-thread communication. It is defined in the object class, and should only be called from a synchronized context. Example: Multithreading Interview Questions synchronized(monitor) { monitor.wait(); Here Lock Is Released by Current Thread } sleep(): As the name suggests, it is a static method that pauses or stops the execution of the current thread for some specified period. It doesn’t release the lock while waiting and is mostly used to introduce pause on execution. It is defined in thread class, and no need to call from a synchronized context. Example:"
"9. What’s the diﬀerence between notify() and notifyAll()? notify(): It sends a notification and wakes up only a single thread instead of multiple threads that are waiting on the object’s monitor. synchronized(monitor) { Thread.sleep(1000); Here Lock Is Held by The Current Thread //after 1000 milliseconds, the current thread will wake up, or after we call that is in } Multithreading Interview Questions notifyAll(): It sends notifications and wakes up all threads and allows them to compete for the object's monitor instead of a single thread."
"10. Why wait(), notify(), and notifyAll() methods are present in Object class? We know that every object has a monitor that allows the thread to hold a lock on the object. But the thread class doesn't contain any monitors. Thread usually waits for the object’s monitor (lock) by calling the wait() method on an object, and notify other threads that are waiting for the same lock using notify() or notifyAll() method. Therefore, these three methods are called on objects only and allow all threads to communicate with each that are created on that object."
"11. What is Runnable and Callable Interface? Write the diﬀerence between them. Multithreading Interview Questions Both the interfaces are generally used to encapsulate tasks that are needed to be executed by another thread. But there are some diﬀerences between them as given below: Running Interface: This interface is basically available in Java right from the beginning. It is simply used to execute code on a concurrent thread. Callable Interface: This interface is basically a new one that was introduced as a part of the concurrency package. It addresses the limitation of runnable interfaces along with some major changes like generics, enum, static imports, variable argument method, etc. It uses generics to define the return type of object. public interface Runnable { public abstract void run(); } public interface Callable<V> { V call() throws Exception; } Runnable Interface vs Callable Interface Multithreading Interview Questions Runnable Interface Callable Interface It does not return any result and therefore, cannot throw a checked exception. It returns a result and therefore, can throw an exception. It cannot be passed to invokeAll method. It can be passed to invokeAll method. It was introduced in JDK 1.0.It was introduced in JDK 5.0, so one cannot use it before Java 5. It simply belongs to Java.lang.It simply belongs to java.util.concurrent. It uses the run() method to define a task.It uses the call() method to define a task. To use this interface, one needs to override the run() method. To use this interface, one needs to override the call() method."
"12. What is the start() and run() method of Thread class? Multithreading Interview Questions start(): In simple words, the start() method is used to start or begin the execution of a newly created thread. When the start() method is called, a new thread is created and this newly created thread executes the task that is kept in the run() method. One can call the start() method only once. run(): In simple words, the run() method is used to start or begin the execution of the same thread. When the run() method is called, no new thread is created as in the case of the start() method. This method is executed by the current thread. One can call the run() method multiple times."
"13. Explain thread pool? A Thread pool is simply a collection of pre-initialized or worker threads at the start-up that can be used to execute tasks and put back in the pool when completed. It is referred to as pool threads in which a group of fixed-size threads is created. By reducing the number of application threads and managing their lifecycle, one can mitigate the issue of performance using a thread pool. Using threads, performance can be enhanced and better system stability can occur. To create the thread pools, java.util.concurrent.Executors class usually provides factory methods."
"14. What’s the purpose of the join() method? join() method is generally used to pause the execution of a current thread unless and until the specified thread on which join is called is dead or completed. To stop a thread from running until another thread gets ended, this method can be used. It joins the start of a thread execution to the end of another thread’s execution. It is considered the final method of a thread class."
"15. What do you mean by garbage collection? Garbage collection is basically a process of managing memory automatically. It uses several GC algorithms among which the popular one includes Mark and Sweep. The process includes three phases i.e., marking, deletion, and compaction/copying. In simple words, a garbage collector finds objects that are no longer required by the program and then delete or remove these unused objects to free up the memory space. Multithreading Interview Questions"
"16. Explain the meaning of the deadlock and when it can occur? Deadlock, as the name suggests, is a situation where multiple threads are blocked forever. It generally occurs when multiple threads hold locks on diﬀerent resources and are waiting for other resources to complete their task. The above diagram shows a deadlock situation where two threads are blocked forever. Thread 1 is holding Object 1 but needs object 2 to complete processing whereas Thread 2 is holding Object 2 but needs object 1 first. In such conditions, both of them will hold lock forever and will never complete tasks."
"17. Explain volatile variables in Java? A volatile variable is basically a keyword that is used to ensure and address the visibility of changes to variables in multithreaded programming. This keyword cannot be used with classes and methods, instead can be used with variables. It is simply used to achieve thread-safety. If you mark any variable as volatile, then all the threads can read its value directly from the main memory rather than CPU cache, so that each thread can get an updated value of the variable."
"18. How do threads communicate with each other? Threads can communicate using three methods i.e., wait(), notify(), and notifyAll(). Multithreading Interview Questions"
"19. Can two threads execute two methods (static and non-static concurrently)? Yes, it is possible. If both the threads acquire locks on diﬀerent objects, then they can execute concurrently without any problem."
20. What is the purpose of the finalize() method? Finalize() method is basically a method of Object class specially used to perform cleanup operations on unmanaged resources just before garbage collection. It is not at all intended to be called a normal method. A
21. What is the synchronization process? Why use it? Synchronization is basically a process in java that enables a simple strategy for avoiding thread interference and memory consistency errors. This process makes sure that resource will be only used one thread at a time when one thread tries to access a shared resource. It can be achieved in three diﬀerent ways as given below: By the synchronized method By synchronized block By static synchronization Syntax: synchronized (object) { //statement to be synchronized }
"22. What is synchronized method and synchronized block? Which one should be preferred? Multithreading Interview Questions Synchronized Method: In this method, the thread acquires a lock on the object when they enter the synchronized method and releases the lock either normally or by throwing an exception when they leave the method. No other thread can use the whole method unless and until the current thread finishes its execution and release the lock. It can be used when one wants to lock on the entire functionality of a particular method. Synchronized Block: In this method, the thread acquires a lock on the object between parentheses a"
23. What is thread starvation? Thread starvation is basically a situation or condition where a thread won’t be able to have regular access to shared resources and therefore is unable to proceed or make progress. This is because other threads have high priority and occupy the resources for too long. This usually happens with low-priority threads that do not get CPU for its execution to carry on. Multithreading Interview Questions
"24. What is Livelock? What happens when it occurs? Similar to deadlock, livelock is also another concurrency problem. In this case, the state of threads changes between one another without making any progress. Threads are not blocked but their execution is stopped due to the unavailability of resources."
"25. What is BlockingQueue? BlockingQueue basically represents a queue that is thread-safe. Producer thread inserts resource/element into the queue using put() method unless it gets full and consumer thread takes resources from the queue using take() method until it gets empty. But if a thread tries to dequeue from an empty queue, then a particular thread will be blocked until some other thread inserts an item into the queue, or if a thread tries to insert an item into a queue that is already full, then a particular thread will be blocked until some threads take away an item from the queue. Multithreading Interview Questions Example: Multithreading Interview Questions package org.arpit.java2blog; import java.util.concurrent.ArrayBlockingQueue; import java.util.concurrent.BlockingQueue; public class BlockingQueuePCExample { public static void main(String[] args) { BlockingQueue<String> queue=new ArrayBlockingQueue<>(5); Producer producer=new Producer(queue); Consumer consumer=new Consumer(queue); Thread producerThread = new Thread(producer); Thread consumerThread = new Thread(consumer); producerThread.start(); consumerThread.start(); } static class Producer implements Runnable { BlockingQueue<String> queue=null; public Producer(BlockingQueue queue) { super(); this.queue = queue; } @Override public void run() { try { System.out.println(""Producing element 1""); queue.put(""Element 1""); Thread.sleep(1000); System.out.println(""Producing element 2""); queue.put(""Element 2""); Thread.sleep(1000); System.out.println(""Producing element 3""); queue.put(""Element 3""); } catch (InterruptedException e) { e.printStackTrace(); } } } static class Consumer implements Runnable { BlockingQueue<String> queue=null; public Consumer(BlockingQueue queue) { super(); this.queue = queue; } @id Multithreading Interview Questions Output: Producing element 1 Consumed Element 1 Producing element 2 Consumed Element 2 Producing element 3 Consumed Element 3"
"26. Can you start a thread twice? No, it's not at all possible to restart a thread once a thread gets started and completes its execution. Thread only runs once and if you try to run it for a second time, then it will throw a runtime exception i.e., java.lang.IllegalThreadStateException. Example: public class TestThreadTwice1 extends Thread{ public void run(){ System.out.println("" thread is executing now........""); } public static void main(String args[]){ TestThreadTwice1 t1=new TestThreadTwice1(); t1.start(); t1.start(); } } Output: thread is executing now........ Exception in thread ""main"" java.lang.IllegalThreadStateException"
"27. Explain context switching. Multithreading Interview Questions Context switching is basically an important feature of multithreading. It is referred to as switching of CPU from one thread or process to another one. It allows multiple processes to share the same CPU. In context switching, the state of thread or process is stored so that the execution of the thread can be resumed later if required."
"28. What is CyclicBarrier and CountDownLatch? CyclicBarrier and CountDownLatch, both are required for managing multithreaded programming. But there is some diﬀerence between them as given below: CyclicBarrier: It is a tool to synchronize threads processing using some algorithm. It enables a set of threads to wait for each other till they reach a common execution point or common barrier points, and then let them further continue execution. One can reuse the same CyclicBarrier even if the barrier is broken by setting it. CountDownLatch: It is a tool that enables main threads to wait until mandatory operations are performed and completed by other threads. In simple words, it makes sure that a thread waits until the execution in another thread completes before it starts its execution. One cannot reuse the same CountDownLatch once the count reaches 0."
"29. What do you mean by inter-thread communication? Multithreading Interview Questions Inter-thread communication, as the name suggests, is a process or mechanism using which multiple threads can communicate with each other. It is especially used to avoid thread polling in java and can be obtained using wait(), notify(), and notifyAll() methods."
"30. What is Thread Scheduler and Time Slicing? Thread Scheduler: It is a component of JVM that is used to decide which thread will execute next if multiple threads are waiting to get the chance of execution. By looking at the priority assigned to each thread that is READY, the thread scheduler selects the next run to execute. To schedule the threads, it mainly uses two mechanisms: Preemptive Scheduling and Time slicing scheduling. Time Slicing: It is especially used to divide CPU time and allocate them to active threads. In this, each thread will get a predefined slice of time to execute. When the time expires, a particular thread has to wait till other threads get their chances to use their time in a round-robin fashion. Every running thread will get executed for a fixed time period."
"31. What is a shutdown hook? A shutdown hook is simply a thread that is invoked implicitly before JVM shuts down. It is one of the most important features of JVM because it provides the capacity to do resource cleanup or save application state JVM shuts down. By calling the halt(int) method of the Runtime class, the shutdown hook can be stopped. Using the following method, one can add a shutdown hook. public void addShutdownHook(Thread hook){} Runtime r=Runtime.getRuntime(); r.addShutdownHook(new MyThread());"
"32. What is busy spinning? Multithreading Interview Questions Busy Spinning, also known as Busy-waiting, is a technique in which one thread waits for some condition to happen, without calling wait or sleep methods and releasing the CPU. In this condition, one can pause a thread by making it run an empty loop for a certain time period, and it does not even give CPY control. Therefore, it is used to preserve CPU caches and avoid the cost of rebuilding cache."
"33. What is ConcurrentHashMap and Hashtable? In java, why is ConcurrentHashMap considered faster than Hashtable? ConcurrentHashMap: It was introduced in Java 1.5 to store data using multiple buckets. As the name suggests, it allows concurrent read and writes operations to the map. It only locks a certain portion of the map while doing iteration to provide thread safety so that other readers can still have access to the map without waiting for iteration to complete. Hashtable: It is a thread-safe legacy class that was introduced in old versions of java to store key or value pairs using a hash table. It does not provide any lock-free read, unlike ConcurrentHashMap. It just locks the entire map while doing iteration. ConcurrentHashMap and Hashtable, both are thread-safe but ConcurrentHashMap generally avoids read locks and improves performance, unlike Hashtable. ConcurrentHashMap also provides lock-free reads, unlike Hashtable. Therefore, ConcurrentHashMap is considered faster than Hashtable especially when the number of readers is more as compared to the number of writers."
34. Explain thread priority. Thread priority simply means that threads with the highest priority will get a chance for execution prior to low-priority threads. One can specify the priority but it's not necessary that the highest priority thread will get executed before the lower-priority thread. Thread scheduler assigns processor to thread on the basis of thread priority. The range of priority changes between 1-10 from lowest priority to highest priority. Multithreading Interview Questions
"35. What do you mean by the ThreadLocal variable in Java? ThreadLocal variables are special kinds of variables created and provided by the Java ThreadLocal class. These variables are only allowed to be read and written by the same thread. Two threads cannot be able to see each other’s ThreadLocal variable, so even if they will execute the same code, then there won't be any race condition and the code will be thread-safe. Example: Multithreading Interview Questions public class ThreadLocalExp { public static class MyRunnable implements Runnable { private ThreadLocal<Integer> threadLocal = new ThreadLocal<Integer>(); @Override public void run() { threadLocal.set( (int) (Math.random() * 50D) ); try { Thread.sleep(1000); } catch (InterruptedException e) { } System.out.println(threadLocal.get()); } } public static void main(String[] args) { MyRunnable runnableInstance = new MyRunnable(); Thread t1 = new Thread(runnableInstance); Thread t2 = new Thread(runnableInstance); // this will call run() method t1.start(); t2.start(); } } Output: 10 33 10 33"
36. What is semaphore? Semaphore is regarded as a thread synchronization construct that is usually required to control and manage the access to the shared resource using counters. It simply sets the limit of the thread. The semaphore class is defined within the package java.util.concurrent and can be used to send signals between threads to avoid missed signals or to guard critical sections. It can also be used to implement resource pools or bounded collection. Multithreading Interview Questions
"37. Explain Thread Group. Why should we not use it? ThreadGroup is a class that is used to create multiple groups of threads in a single object. This group of threads is present in the form of three structures in which every thread group has a parent except the initial thread. Thread groups can contain other thread groups also. A thread is only allowed to have access to information about its own thread group, not other thread groups. Previously in the old version of Java, the only functionality that did not work without a thread group was uncaughtException( Thread t, Throwable e). But now in Java 5 versions, there is Thread.setUncaughtExceptionHandler(UncaughtExceptionHandler). So now even that works without thread groups and therefore, there is no need to use thread groups. t1.setUncaughtExceptionHandler(new UncaughtExceptionHandler() { @Override public void uncaughtException(Thread t, Throwable e) { System.out.println(""exception occured:""+e.getMessage()); } };"
"38. What is the ExecutorService interface? ExecutorService interface is basically a sub-interface of Executor interface with some additional methods or features that help in managing and controlling the execution of threads. It enables us to execute tasks asynchronously on threads. Multithreading Interview Questions Example: Multithreading Interview Questions Output: Shutdown executor shutdown finished import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService; import java.util.concurrent.Executors; import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit; public class TestThread { public static void main(final String[] arguments) th ExecutorService e = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor(); try { e.submit(new Thread()); System.out.println(""Shutdown executor""); e.shutdown(); e.awaitTermination(5, TimeUnit.SECONDS); } catch (InterruptedException ex) { System.err.println(""tasks interrupted""); } finally { if (!e.isTerminated()) { System.err.println(""cancel non-finished tasks""); } e.shutdownNow(); System.out.println(""shutdown finished""); } } static class Task implements Runnable { public void run() { try { Long duration = (long) (Math.random() * 20); System.out.println(""Running Task!""); TimeUnit.SECONDS.sleep(duration); } catch (InterruptedException ex) { ex.printStackTrace(); } } } } Multithreading Interview Questions"
"39. What will happen if we don’t override the thread class run() method? Nothing will happen as such if we don’t override the run() method. The compiler will not show any error. It will execute the run() method of thread class and we will just don’t get any output because the run() method is with an empty implementation. Example: class MyThread extends Thread { //don't override run() method } public class DontOverrideRun { public static void main(String[] args) { System.out.println(""Started Main.""); MyThread thread1=new MyThread(); thread1.start(); System.out.println(""Ended Main.""); } } Output: Started Main. Ended Main."
"40. What is the lock interface? Why is it better to use a lock interface rather than a synchronized block.? Lock interface was introduced in Java 1.5 and is generally used as a synchronization mechanism to provide important operations for blocking. Advantages of using Lock interface over Synchronization block: Multithreading Interview Questions Methods of Lock interface i.e., Lock() and Unlock() can be called in diﬀerent methods. It is the main advantage of a lock interface over a synchronized block because the synchronized block is fully contained in a single method. Lock interface is more flexible and makes sure that the longest waiting thread gets a fair chance for execution, unlike the synchronization block."
"41. Is it possible to call the run() method directly to start a new thread? No, it's not possible at all. You need to call the start method to create a new thread otherwise run method won't create a new thread. Instead, it will execute in the current thread."
"42. Is it possible that each thread can have its stack in multithreaded programming? Of course, it is possible. In multithreaded programming, each thread maintains its own separate stack area in memory because of which every thread is independent of each other rather than dependent. "

"7. What are the advantages and disadvantages of cloud computing? Cloud computing has the following advantages and disadvantages: System Engineer Interview Questions Advantages: Ideal as a regular backup source of data storage due to its flexibility. You can recover data in case of accidental deletion, natural disaster, or a hard drive crash. With the cloud, you save money in a variety of ways including zero investment in infrastructure; since you do not own the infrastructure; no management or staﬀing costs; as the cloud oﬀers a pay-as-you-go model, so you only pay for resources that you need. You have complete access to your cloud resources from anywhere, anytime and on any device. Centralizes data from various projects and branches into one place, which means you can access the data without having to visit each location individually. With cloud-based applications, the system can automatically be updated without users' involvement. Disadvantages: System Engineer Interview Questions Cloud deployments are not ideal for large-scale IoT deployments. The cloud requires high internet speeds and high bandwidth, so service outages are always possible, which can cause business downtime. Because you don't own the cloud infrastructure, you have no control or limited access to it. The cloud oﬀers a wide range of services, but using them comes with several restrictions and limited flexibility. Data security is a major concern for everyone. Using a public cloud could put you at risk for security breaches."
"8. How do you troubleshoot failed systems or websites? Employers can use this question to gauge how the candidate defines and approaches a particular problem statement. Tips: Have knowledge of system analysis control, requirements analysis, functional analysis and allocation, as well as design synthesis. Even though there are no standard definitions for troubleshooting, these are the most common procedures. Demonstrate your ability to adapt processes to meet current needs. Sample Answer: ""Before moving to the SE process, I always ask what the problem is, and why it needs to be solved. As I try to identify the problem and possible solutions to it, I come up with several options. Keeping systems running smoothly is a major part of my job, and in some cases, I may need to modify processes to resolve certain problems""."
"9. What is DNS? How does it operate on an internal network? System Engineer Interview Questions DNS stands for Domain Name System. It is the Internet's phone book. On the internet, humans access information by using domain names, such as scaler.com or interviewbit.com. Internet Protocol (IP) addresses are used by web browsers to interact with websites. A domain name is translated to an IP address (such as 152.178.1.1) by DNS, and the browser requests that IP address from the DNS server to make a connection and access the internet resources. In a nutshell, DNS is a network service that allows connections to be made to local or internet addresses using domain names rather than IP addresses."
"10. How do you resolve conflict between two diﬀerent tech teams? A system engineer is capable of working with several technology teams within an organization or on projects with varying scopes and complexity.

Child themes let you change small details of your site's appearance while still preserving the parent theme's appearance and functionality. The child theme is designed to inherit the features and appearance of the parent theme, while also enabling the user to make modifications/alterations to any part of the theme."
"41. Explain WordPress Taxonomies. WordPress Taxonomies group content or data together in WordPress. Shortly, it allows you to organize/group your posts based on what they have in common (characteristics). Several default taxonomies are available, and you can also design your own. WordPress's Categories and Tags are two of its most popular taxonomies."
"42. Explain Category and Tags in WordPress. How to convert a category into a tag? Categorization and tags play a much greater role in the content organization as well as SEO. Categories: Essentially, categories are a general way to group content on a WordPress website. The idea of a category is to represent a topic or a group of topics that are somehow related to one another. A post can belong to several categories at once. Nevertheless, assigning more than two or three categories to one post is perhaps not the best idea. Tags: Tags provide a good way to identify a piece of content by specific keywords. Just choose a few words that best describe a given post."
Data Structure Interview Questions Basic Data Structure Interview Questions for Freshers Data Structure Interview Questions for Experienced Data Structure MCQ Basic Data Structure Interview Questions for Freshers
"1. What are Data Structures? A data structure is a mechanical or logical way that data is organized within a program. The organization of data is what determines how a program performs. There are many types of data structures, each with its own uses. When designing code, we need to pay particular attention to the way data is structured. If data isn't stored eﬀiciently or correctly structured, then the overall performance of the code will be reduced."
"2. Why Create Data Structures? Data structures serve a number of important functions in a program. They ensure that each line of code performs its function correctly and eﬀiciently, they help the programmer identify and fix problems with his/her code, and they help to create a clear and organized code base."
3. What are some applications of Data structures? Following are some real-time applications of data structures: Data Structure Interview Questions Decision Making Genetics Image Processing Blockchain Numerical and Statistical Analysis Compiler Design Database Design and many more
"4. Explain the process behind storing a variable in memory. A variable is stored in memory based on the amount of memory that is needed. Following are the steps followed to store a variable: The required amount of memory is assigned first. Then, it is stored based on the data structure being used. Using concepts like dynamic allocation ensures high eﬀiciency and that the storage units can be accessed based on requirements in real-time."
"5. Can you explain the diﬀerence between file structure and storage structure? Data Structure Interview Questions File Structure: Representation of data into secondary or auxiliary memory say any device such as a hard disk or pen drives that stores data which remains intact until manually deleted is known as a file structure representation. Storage Structure: In this type, data is stored in the main memory i.e RAM, and is deleted once the function that uses this data gets completely executed. The diﬀerence is that the storage structure has data stored in the memory of the computer system, whereas the file structure has the data stored in the auxiliary memory."
"6. Describe the types of Data Structures? Linear Data Structure: A data structure that includes data elements arranged sequentially or linearly, where each element is connected to its previous and next nearest elements, is referred to as a linear data structure. Arrays and linked lists are two examples of linear data structures. Non-Linear Data Structure: Non-linear data structures are data structures in which data elements are not arranged linearly or sequentially. We cannot walk through all elements in one pass in a non-linear data structure, as in a linear data structure. Trees and graphs are two examples of non-linear data structures."
"7. What is a stack data structure? What are the applications of stack? Data Structure Interview Questions A stack is a data structure that is used to represent the state of an application at a particular point in time. The stack consists of a series of items that are added to the top of the stack and then removed from the top. It is a linear data structure that follows a particular order in which operations are performed. LIFO (Last In First Out) or FILO (First In Last Out) are two possible orders. A stack consists of a sequence of items. The element that's added last will come out first, a real-life example might be a stack of clothes on top of each other. When we remove the cloth that was previously on top, we can say that the cloth that was added last comes out first. Following are some applications for stack data structure: It acts as temporary storage during recursive operations Redo and Undo operations in doc editors Reversing a string Parenthesis matching Postfix to Infix Expressions Function calls order"
8. What are diﬀerent operations available in stack data structure? Data Structure Interview Questions Some of the main operations provided in the stack data structure are: push: This adds an item to the top of the stack. The overflow condition occurs if the stack is full. pop: This removes the top item of the stack. Underflow condition occurs if the stack is empty. top: This returns the top item from the stack. isEmpty: This returns true if the stack is empty else false. size: This returns the size of the stack.
"9. What is a queue data structure? What are the applications of queue? A queue is a linear data structure that allows users to store items in a list in a systematic manner. The items are added to the queue at the rear end until they are full, at which point they are removed from the queue from the front. Queues are commonly used in situations where the users want to hold items for a long period of time, such as during a checkout process. A good example of a queue is any queue of customers for a resource where the first consumer is served first. Following are some applications of queue data structure: Data Structure Interview Questions Breadth-first search algorithm in graphs Operating system: job scheduling operations, Disk scheduling, CPU scheduling etc. Call management in call centres"
10. What are diﬀerent operations available in queue data structure? enqueue: This adds an element to the rear end of the queue. Overflow conditions occur if the queue is full. dequeue: This removes an element from the front end of the queue. Underflow conditions occur if the queue is empty. isEmpty: This returns true if the queue is empty or else false. rear: This returns the rear end element without removing it. front: This returns the front-end element without removing it. size: This returns the size of the queue.
11. Diﬀerentiate between stack and queue data structure. Data Structure Interview Questions Stack Queue Stack is a linear data structure where data is added and removed from the top.Queue is a linear data structure where data is ended at the rear end and removed from the front. Stack is based on LIFO(Last In First Out) principleQueue is based on FIFO(First In First Out) principle Insertion operation in Stack is known as push.Insertion operation in Queue is known as eneque. Delete operation in Stack is known as pop.Delete operation in Queue is known as pop. Only one pointer is available for both addition and deletion: top()Two pointers are available for addition and deletion: front() and rear() Used in solving recursion problemsUsed in solving sequential processing problems
"12. How to implement a queue using stack? Data Structure Interview Questions A queue can be implemented using two stacks. Let q be the queue andstack1 and stack2 be the 2 stacks for implementing q. We know that stack supports push, pop, and peek operations and using these operations, we need to emulate the operations of the queue - enqueue and dequeue. Hence, queue q can be implemented in two methods (Both the methods use auxillary space complexity of O(n)):"
"1. By making enqueue operation costly: Here, the oldest element is always at the top of stack1 which ensures dequeue operation occurs in O(1) time complexity. To place the element at top of stack1, stack2 is used. Pseudocode: Enqueue: Here time complexity will be O(n) enqueue(q, data): While stack1 is not empty: Push everything from stack1 to stack2. Push data to stack1 Push everything back to stack1. Dequeue: Here time complexity will be O(1) deQueue(q): If stack1 is empty then error else Pop an item from stack1 and return it"
"2. By making the dequeue operation costly: Data Structure Interview Questions Here, for enqueue operation, the new element is pushed at the top of stack1. Here, the enqueue operation time complexity is O(1). In dequeue, if stack2 is empty, all elements from stack1 are moved to stack2 and top of stack2 is the result. Basically, reversing the list by pushing to a stack and returning the first enqueued element. This operation of pushing all elements to a new stack takes O(n) complexity. Pseudocode: Enqueue: Time complexity: O(1) enqueue(q, data): Push data to stack1 Dequeue: Time complexity: O(n) dequeue(q): If both stacks are empty then raise error. If stack2 is empty: While stack1 is not empty: push everything from stack1 to stack2. Pop the element from stack2 and return it."
"13. How do you implement stack using queues? A stack can be implemented using two queues. We know that a queue supports enqueue and dequeue operations. Using these operations, we need to develop push, pop operations. Let stack be ‘s’ and queues used to implement be ‘q1’ and ‘q2’. Then, stack ‘s’ can be implemented in two ways:"
"1. By making push operation costly: Data Structure Interview Questions This method ensures that the newly entered element is always at the front of ‘q1’ so that pop operation just dequeues from ‘q1’. ‘q2’ is used as auxillary queue to put every new element in front of ‘q1’ while ensuring pop happens in O(1) complexity. Pseudocode: Push element to stack s: Here push takes O(n) time complexity. push(s, data): Enqueue data to q2 Dequeue elements one by one from q1 and enqueue to q2. Swap the names of q1 and q2 Pop element from stack s: Takes O(1) time complexity. pop(s): dequeue from q1 and return it."
"2. By making pop operation costly: In push operation, the element is enqueued to q1. In pop operation, all the elements from q1 except the last remaining element, are pushed to q2 if it is empty. That last element remaining of q1 is dequeued and returned. Pseudocode: Push element to stack s: Here push takes O(1) time complexity. push(s,data): Enqueue data to q1 Pop element from stack s: Takes O(n) time complexity. Data Structure Interview Questions"
"14. What is array data structure? What are the applications of arrays? An array data structure is a data structure that is used to store data in a way that is eﬀicient and easy to access. It is similar to a list in that it stores data in a sequence. However, an array data structure diﬀers from a list in that it can hold much more data than a list can. An array data structure is created by combining several arrays together. Each array is then given a unique identifier, and each array’s data is stored in the order in which they are created. Array data structures are commonly used in databases and other computer systems to store large amounts of data eﬀiciently. They are also useful for storing information that is frequently accessed, such as large amounts of text or images."
"15. Elaborate on diﬀerent types of array data structure There are several diﬀerent types of arrays: pop(s): Step1: Dequeue every elements except the last element from q1 and enqueue to q2. Step2: Dequeue the last item of q1, the dequeued item is stored in result variable. Step3: Swap the names of q1 and q2 (for getting updated data after dequeue) Step4: Return the result. Data Structure Interview Questions One-dimensional array: A one-dimensional array stores its elements in contiguous memory locations, accessing them using a single index value. It is a linear data structure holding all the elements in a sequence. Two-dimensional array: A two-dimensional array is a tabular array that includes rows and columns and stores data. An M × N two-dimensional array is created by grouping M rows and N columns into N columns and rows. Data Structure Interview Questions Three-dimensional array: A three-dimensional array is a grid that has rows, columns, and depth as a third dimension. It comprises a cube with rows, columns, and depth as a third dimension. The three-dimensional array has three subscripts for a position in a particular row, column, and depth. Depth (dimension or layer) is the first index, row index is the second index, and column index is the third index."
"16. What is a linked list data structure? What are the applications for the Linked list? A linked list can be thought of as a series of linked nodes (or items) that are connected by links (or paths). Each link represents an entry into the linked list, and each entry points to the next node in the sequence. The order in which nodes are added to the list is determined by the order in which they are created. Data Structure Interview Questions Following are some applications of linked list data structure: Stack, Queue, binary trees, and graphs are implemented using linked lists. Dynamic management for Operating System memory. Round robin scheduling for operating system tasks. Forward and backward operation in the browser."
17. Elaborate on diﬀerent types of Linked List data structures? Following are diﬀerent types of linked lists: Data Structure Interview Questions
"1. Singly Linked List: A singly linked list is a data structure that is used to store multiple items. The items are linked together using the key. The key is used to identify the item and is usually a unique identifier. In a singly linked list, each item is stored in a separate node. The node can be a single object or it can be a collection of objects. When an item is added to the list, the node is updated and the new item is added to the end of the list. When an item is removed from the list, the node that contains the removed item is deleted and its place is taken by another node. The key of a singly linked list can be any type of data structure that can be used to identify an object. For example, it could be an integer, a string, or even another singly linked list. Singly-linked lists are useful for storing many diﬀerent types of data. For example, they are commonly used to store lists of items such as grocery lists or patient records. They are also useful for storing data that is time sensitive such as stock market prices or flight schedules."
"2. Doubly Linked List: A doubly linked list is a data structure that allows for two-way data access such that each node in the list points to the next node in the list and also points back to its previous node. In a doubly linked list, each node can be accessed by its address, and the contents of the node can be accessed by its index. It's ideal for applications that need to access large amounts of data in a fast manner. A disadvantage of a doubly linked list is that it is more diﬀicult to maintain than a single-linked list. In addition, it is more diﬀicult to add and remove nodes than in a single-linked list. Data Structure Interview Questions"
"3. Circular Linked List: A circular linked list is a unidirectional linked list where each node points to its next node and the last node points back to the first node, which makes it circular."
4. Doubly Circular Linked List: A doubly circular linked list is a linked list where each node points to its next node and its previous node and the last node points back to the first node and first node’s previous points to the last node. Data Structure Interview Questions
"5. Header List: A list that contains the header node at the beginning of the list, is called the header-linked list. This is helpful in calculating some repetitive operations like the number of elements in the list etc."
"18. Diﬀerence between Array and Linked List. Data Structure Interview Questions Arrays Linked Lists An array is a collection of data elements of the same type.A linked list is a collection of entities known as nodes. The node is divided into two sections: data and address. It keeps the data elements in a single memory.It stores elements at random, or anywhere in the memory. The memory size of an array is fixed and cannot be changed during runtime.The memory size of a linked list is allocated during runtime. An array's elements are not dependent on one another.Linked List elements are dependent on one another.

Asymptotic analysis helps us articulate the best case(Omega Notation, Ω), average case(Theta Notation, θ), and worst case(Big Oh Notation, Ο) performance of an algorithm."
20. What is hashmap in data structure? Hashmap is a data structure that uses an implementation of a hash table data structure which allows access to data in constant time (O(1)) complexity if you have the key.
21. What is the requirement for an object to be used as key or value in HashMap? The key or value object that gets used in the hashmap must implement equals() and hashcode() method. The hash code is used when inserting the key object into the map and the equals method is used when trying to retrieve a value from the map.
"22. How does HashMap handle collisions in Java? The java.util.HashMap class in Java uses the approach of chaining to handle collisions. In chaining, if the new values with the same key are attempted to be pushed, then these values are stored in a linked list stored in a bucket of the key as a chain along with the existing value. In the worst-case scenario, it can happen that all keys might have the same hashcode, which will result in the hash table turning into a linked list. In this case, searching a value will take O(n) complexity as opposed to O(1) time due to the nature of the linked list. Hence, care has to be taken while selecting hashing algorithm."

"24. What is binary tree data structure? What are the applications for binary trees? A binary tree is a data structure that is used to organize data in a way that allows for eﬀicient retrieval and manipulation. It is a data structure that uses two nodes, called leaves and nodes, to represent the data. The leaves represent the data and the nodes represent the relationships between the leaves. Each node has two children, called siblings, and each child has one parent. The parent is the node that is closest to the root of the tree. When a node is deleted from the tree, it is deleted from both its child and its parent. Following are some applications for binary tree data structure: It's widely used in computer networks for storing routing table information. Decision Trees. Expression Evaluation. Database indices. Data Structure Interview Questions"
"25. What is binary search tree data structure? What are the applications for binary search trees? A binary search tree is a data structure that stores items in sorted order. In a binary search tree, each node stores a key and a value. The key is used to access the item and the value is used to determine whether the item is present or not. The key can be any type of value such as an integer, floating point number, character string, or even a combination of these types. The value can be any type of items such as an integer, floating point number, character string, or even a combination of these types. When a node is added to the tree, its key is used to access the item stored at that node. When a node is removed from the tree, its key is used to access the item stored at that node. A binary search tree is a special type of binary tree that has a specific order of elements in it. It has three basic qualities: All elements in the le"
26. What are tree traversals? Tree traversal is the process of visiting all the nodes of a tree. Since the root (head) is the first node and all nodes are connected via edges (or links) we always start with that node. There are three ways which we use to traverse a tree −
1. Inorder Traversal: Algorithm: Step 1. Traverse the le
2. Preorder Traversal: Algorithm: Step 1. Visit the root. Step 2. Traverse the le
3. Postorder Traversal: Algorithm: Step 1. Traverse the le
"27. What is a deque data structure and its types? What are the applications for deque? A deque can be thought of as an array of items, but with one important diﬀerence: Instead of pushing and popping items oﬀ the end to make room, deques are designed to allow items to be inserted at either end. This property makes deques well-suited for performing tasks such as keeping track of inventory, scheduling tasks, or handling large amounts of data. Data Structure Interview Questions There are two types of deque: Input Restricted Deque: Insertion operations are performed at only one end while deletion is performed at both ends in the input restricted queue. Output Restricted Deque: Deletion operations are performed at only one end while insertion is performed at both ends in the output restricted queue. Following are some real-time applications for deque data structure: It can be used as both stack and queue, as it supports all the operations for both data structures. Web browser’s history can be stored in a deque. Operating systems job scheduling algorithm. Data Structure Interview Questions"
28. What are some key operations performed on the Deque data structure? Following are the key operations available deque: insertFront(): This adds an element to the front of the Deque. insertLast(): This adds an element to the rear of the Deque. deleteFront(): This deletes an element from the front of the Deque. deleteLast():This deletes an element from the front of the Deque. getFront(): This gets an element from the front of the Deque. getRear(): This gets an element from the rear of the Deque. isEmpty(): This checks whether Deque is empty or not. isFull(): This checks whether Deque is full or not.
"29. What is a priority queue? What are the applications for priority queue? Priority Queue is an abstract data type that is similar to a queue in that each element is assigned a priority value. The order in which elements in a priority queue are served is determined by their priority (i.e., the order in which they are removed). If the elements have the same priority, they are served in the order they appear in the queue. Data Structure Interview Questions Following are some real-time applications for priority queue: Used in graph algorithms like Dijkstra, Prim’s Minimum spanning tree etc. Huﬀman code for data compression Finding Kth Largest/Smallest element"

"31. What is graph data structure and its representations? What are the applications for graphs? A graph is a type of non-linear data structure made up of nodes and edges. The nodes are also known as vertices, and edges are lines or arcs that connect any two nodes in the graph. The following are the two most common graph representations:"
"1. Adjacency Matrix: Adjacency Matrix is a two-dimensional array with the dimensions V x V, where V is the number of vertices in a graph. Representation is simpler to implement and adhere to. It takes O(1) time to remove an edge. Queries such as whether there is an edge from vertex 'u' to vertex 'v' are eﬀicient and can be completed in O(1). Data Structure Interview Questions One of the cons of this representation is that even if the graph is sparse (has fewer edges), it takes up the same amount of space. Adding a vertex takes O(V^2). It also takes O(V) time to compute all of a vertex's neighbours, which is not very eﬀicient."
"2. Adjacency List: In this method, each Node holds a list of Nodes that are directly connected to that vertex. Each node at the end of the list is connected with null values to indicate that it is the last node in the list. This saves space O(|V|+|E|). In the worst-case scenario, a graph can have C(V, 2) edges, consuming O(V^2) space. It is simpler to add a vertex. It takes the least amount of time to compute all of a vertex's neighbours. Data Structure Interview Questions One of the cons of this representation is that queries such as ""is there an edge from vertex u to vertex v?"" are ineﬀicient and take O (V) in the worst case."
"32. What is the diﬀerence between the Breadth First Search (BFS) and Depth First Search (DFS)? Data Structure Interview Questions Breadth First Search (BFS) Depth First Search (DFS) It stands for “Breadth First Search”It stands for “Depth First Search” BFS (Breadth First Search) finds the shortest path using the Queue data structure.DFS (Depth First Search) finds the shortest path using the Stack data structure. We walk through all nodes on the same level before passing to the next level in BFS.DFS begins at the root node and proceeds as far as possible through the nodes until we reach the node with no unvisited nearby nodes. When compared to DFS, BFS is slower.When compared to BFS, DFS is faster. BFS performs better when the target is close to the source.DFS performs better when the target is far from the source. BFS necessitates more memory.DFS necessitates less memory. Nodes that have been traversed multiple times are removed from the queue.When there are no more nodes to visit, the visited nodes are added to the stack and then removed. Backtracking is not an option in BFS.The DFS algorithm is a recursive algorithm that employs the concept of backtracking. ItisbasedontheFIFO ItisbasedontheLIFO Data Structure Interview Questions"

"34. What is a B-tree data structure? What are the applications for B-trees? The B Tree is a type of m-way tree that is commonly used for disc access. A B-Tree with order m can only have m-1 keys and m children. One of the primary reasons for using a B tree is its ability to store a large number of keys in a single node as well as large key values while keeping the tree's height relatively small. A B-tree of order 4 is shown below in the image: Following are the key properties of a B-tree data structure: Data Structure Interview Questions All of the leaves are at the same height. The term minimum degree 't' describes a B-Tree. The value of t is determined by the size of the disc block. Except for root, every node must have at least t-1 keys. The root must contain at least one key. All nodes (including root) can have no more than 2*t - 1 keys. The number of children of a node is equal to its key count plus one. A node's keys are sorted in ascending order. The child of two keys k1 and k2 contains all keys between k1 and k2. In contrast to Binary Search Tree, B-Tree grows and shrinks from the root. Following are real-time applications of a B-Tree data structure: It is used to access data stored on discs in large databases. Using a B tree, you can search for data in a data set in significantly less time. The indexing feature allows for multilevel indexing. The B-tree approach is also used by the majority of servers."

The Segment Tree is made up of nodes that represent intervals. Segment Tree is used when there are multiple range queries on an array and changes to array elements. The segment tree of array A[7] will look like this: Data Structure Interview Questions Following are key operations performed on the Segment tree data structure: Building Tree: In this step, we create the structure and initialize the segment tree variable. Updating the Tree: In this step, we change the tree by updating the array value at a point or over an interval. Querying Tree: This operation can be used to run a range query on the array. Following are real-time applications for Segment Tree: Used to eﬀiciently list all pairs of intersecting rectangles from a list of rectangles in the plane. The segment tree has become popular for use in pattern recognition and image processing.

"36. Define Trie data structure and its applications Data Structure Interview Questions The word ""Trie"" is an abbreviation for ""retrieval."" Trie is a data structure that stores a set of strings as a sorted tree. Each node has the same number of pointers as the number of alphabet characters. It can look up a word in the dictionary by using its prefix. Assuming that all strings are formed from the letters 'a' to 'z' in the English alphabet, each trie node can have a maximum of 26 points. Trie is also referred to as the digital tree or the prefix tree. The key to which a node is connected is determined by its position in the Trie. Trie allows us to insert and find strings in O(L) time, where L is the length of a single word. This is clearly faster than BST. Because of how it is implemented, this is also faster than Hashing. There is no need to compute a hash function. There is no need to handle collisions (like we do in open addressing and separate chaining) Another benefit of Trie is that we can easily print all words in alphabetical order, which is not easy with hashing. Trie can also perform prefix search (or auto-complete) eﬀiciently. The main disadvantage of tries is that they require a large amount of memory to store the strings. We have an excessive number of node pointers for each node Following are some real-time applications for Trie data structure: Data Structure Interview Questions Auto-Complete and Search for Search Engines Genome Analysis Data Analytics Browser History Spell Checker"
"37. Define Red-Black Tree and its applications Red Black Trees are a type of self-balancing binary search tree. Rudolf Bayer invented it in 1972 and dubbed it ""symmetric binary B-trees."" A red-black tree is a Binary tree in which each node has a colour attribute, either red or black. By comparing the node colours on any simple path from the root to a leaf, red-black trees ensure that no path is more than twice as long as any other, ensuring that the tree is generally balanced. Red-black trees are similar to binary trees in that they both store their data in two's complementary binary formats. However, red-black trees have one important advantage over binary trees: they are faster to access. Because red-black trees are so fast to access, they are o"
"38. Which data structures are used for implementing LRU cache? Data Structure Interview Questions LRU cache or Least Recently Used cache allows quick identification of an element that hasn’t been put to use for the longest time by organizing items in order of use. In order to achieve this, two data structures are used: Queue – This is implemented using a doubly-linked list. The maximum size of the queue is determined by the cache size, i.e by the total number of available frames. The least recently used pages will be near the front end of the queue whereas the most recently used pages will be towards the rear end of the queue. Hashmap – Hashmap stores the page number as the key along with the address of the corresponding queue node as the value."

"5. What is the diﬀerence between a script and a function in MATLAB? When would you use each? Scripts Functions The script is a file that contains a series of MATLAB commands that are executed in the order that they appear in the file. A function is a separate file that performs a specific task and can take input arguments and return output arguments. Scripts are typically used for automating a series of calculations or analyses. Functions are used when we want to reuse a set of operations in multiple places. Scripts allow for a quick repeat of a set of operations on diﬀerent datasets. We can use functions in multiple places. Scripts do not take any input arguments and return any output arguments.Functions can take any number of input arguments and can return any number of output arguments.

"7. How do you create a matrix in MATLAB? MATLAB Interview Questions We can create a matrix by entering its elements into the command window, a script file, or by using one of some built-in functions. To create a matrix by entering its elements directly, we enclose the elements in square brackets and separate them by spaces or commas. For Example - Suppose we need to create a 3 x 3 matrix with some initial values, then we can create it mat = [1 2 3; 4 5 6; 7 8 9]. We can also use built-in functions like - ""zeros"", ""ones"", and ""eye"". These functions are used for creating a matrix with a specific value. For Example - Suppose we need to create a 2 x 3 matrix with initial all zero values. Then we can use - mat = zeros(2, 3)"

"9. What are cell arrays in MATLAB? How are they diﬀerent from regular arrays? MATLAB Interview Questions Cell arrays are a type of data structure that allows for storing data of diﬀerent types and sizes in a single variable. But regular arrays, which can only store data of a single type and size, cell arrays can store a mixture of numeric, character, and other data types, as well as arrays of diﬀerent sizes. We can create cell arrays using curly braces { }, and their elements are accessed using parentheses ( ). For example - Suppose we need to create a cell array containing a mixture of numeric and character data, So we can do it like this: C = {1, 'hello', [2 3; 4 5]} This creates a 1x3 cell array called C, where the first element is a scalar 1, the second element is the character array 'hello', and the third element is a 2x2 numeric array [2 3; 4 5]. We can access this cell array using parentheses like this - C(1). This returns a 1x1 cell array containing the first element of ‘C’. The cell array is diﬀerent from the regular array in the following ways - MATLAB Interview Questions Cell Array Regular Array Data Types Can hold data of any type and size, including other cells, matrices, strings, etc.Can only hold data of the same type (numerical or logical), with the exception of character arrays Access Accessed using parentheses ( ) and can be indexed using both numerical and character- based indices.Accessed using brackets [ ] and can only be indexed using numerical indices. Memory Usage Has a higher memory overhead compared to regular arrays because each cell requires additional memory to store the type information of its contents.Has a more compact memory representation, which makes them more memory- eﬀicient.

Bar plot: A bar plot displays data as a series of vertical or horizontal bars, where the length or height of each bar represents the value of a variable. This type of plot is useful for comparing values across categories or groups. Pie chart: A pie chart displays data as a series of slices of a circular pie, where the size of each slice represents the proportion of a variable. This type of plot is useful for showing the relative distribution of values across categories or groups. Histogram: A histogram displays data as a series of bars, where each bar represents the frequency of values within a specified range or bin. This type of plot is useful for visualizing the distribution of data and identifying outliers or anomalies. Heatmap: A heatmap displays data as a grid of coloured rectangles, where each rectangle represents the value of a variable. This type of plot is useful for visualizing patterns and relationships in large datasets. MATLAB Interview Questions"
"14. How do you create a GUI in MATLAB? What are some common GUI elements? In MATLAB, we can create GUIs (Graphical User Interfaces) using the ""GUIDE"" (Graphical User Interface Development Environment) tool. GUIDE allows us to design a GUI interactively by adding and customizing various GUI elements, like - buttons, text boxes, sliders, and menus. Once the GUI is designed, GUIDE generates MATLAB code that we can modify and run to implement GUI. Some common GUI elements that we can add to MATLAB GUI are - pushbuttons, checkboxes, radio buttons, drop-down menus, text boxes."
"15. What do you mean by “get” and “set” in MATLAB? ""get"" and ""set"" refer to two functions that allow accessing and modifying the properties of a graphics object. The ""get"" function retrieves the values of the object properties, while the ""set"" function allows modifying the values of these properties. This enables customization of the appearance and behavior of MATLAB graphics objects, like - changing the color, font size, line style, and axis limits of a plot. By using these functions, we can create highly customized and interactive plots and visualizations in MATLAB. MATLAB Interview Questions for Experienced"
"16. Explain in detail about the MATLAB Compilation Process. In MATLAB, code compilation refers to the process of converting a MATLAB script or function to a standalone executable or shared library, also known as a MEX file. The compilation process typically involves the following steps: MATLAB Interview Questions"
1. Preprocessing: Firstly all the preprocessing directives are included in the code like - #define or #include.
"2. Parsing: In this step, the MATLAB code is parsed to identify its syntax, function calls, and dependencies."
"3. Optimization: Now, the code is optimized to improve its performance and reduce its memory usage."
4. Code generation: The optimized code is translated into C or C++ code that can be compiled by a standard C or C++ compiler.
"5. Compilation: The C or C++ code generated in the previous step is compiled into an executable or shared library. Note: The compilation process can be complex and may involve additional steps, like - linking with external libraries or specifying compiler options. However, the end result is a standalone executable or shared library that can be deployed and run on other machines without requiring MATLAB or any additional dependencies."
"17. What is the diﬀerence between size and length in MATLAB? In MATLAB, Both ""size"" and ""length"" are functions that provide information about the dimensions of an array. But there are some key diﬀerences between the two functions that can aﬀect how we use them. Consider the below table to understand the key diﬀerence. MATLAB Interview Questions Feature size() function length() function OutputVector of sizes.Length of longest dimension. UsageGeneral.Vectors/matrices only. InputAny array.Vectors/matrices only. Behavior with multi- dimensional arraysReturns a vector of sizes for all dimensions.Returns the length of the longest dimension. Behavior with empty arraysReturns vector of zeros.Returns 0."
"18. What is a structure in MATLAB? How do you define and access fields in a structure? In MATLAB, a structure is a data type that allows us to group related data together using named fields. Each field can contain a diﬀerent data type, such as numeric arrays, character arrays, or other structures. We can define a structure in MATLAB using the struct function, which creates a new structure with the specified fields and values. Here's an example of how to define a structure representing a person's name and age: personInfo = struct('person', 'XYZ', 'age', 35); MATLAB Interview Questions In this example, we define a new structure called a person with two fields: person and age. The name field is a character array containing the person's name, while the age field is a scalar numeric value representing their age. To access the fields of a structure in MATLAB, we can use dot notation. For example, to access the name field of the person structure we defined earlier, we can use the following syntax: name = person.name; This will assign the value 'XYZ' to the variable name. Similarly, to access the age field, we can use the following syntax: age = person.age; This will assign the value 33 to the variable age."
"19. Both structure and cell array in MATLAB are used for storing diﬀerent values. So how is it diﬀerent? While both structures and cell arrays in MATLAB can store diﬀerent types of data, they have diﬀerent properties and uses. A cell array is an indexed data structure like a normal array. In this, each element can be of a diﬀerent type and size, and it can hold both numeric and non-numeric data. It is useful for storing and manipulating data with varying types and sizes, but it can be less eﬀicient than other data structures for some operations. A structure, on the other hand, is a composite data type that can contain multiple fields, each of which can be of a diﬀerent data type. Structures are typically used for organizing and working with complex data, and they allow for easy access to specific pieces of data within the structure. They are o"
"20. What is the diﬀerence between a handle object and a value object in MATLAB? Explain with an example. In MATLAB, there are two types of objects: handle objects and value objects. Handle objects are objects whose variables are handled (i.e., references) to the objects themselves. This means that when you copy a handle object, you are copying a reference to the same underlying object. Any changes made to the object through one handle will be reflected in all other handles to the same object. Value objects, on the other hand, are objects whose variables are values (i.e., copies) of the objects themselves. This means that when you copy a value object, you are creating a new, independent copy of the object. Changes made to the object through one copy will not aﬀect any other copies. Handle Objects Value Objects Copying Creates a new handle for the same underlying objectCreates an independent copy of the object Memory usageOnly one copy of the object is storedMultiple copies of the object may be stored Example figure handles, object handlesmatrices, strings, cell arrays To understand this better, consider the below code: MATLAB Interview Questions % Define a handle object h = plot(1:10, rand(1,10)); % Copy the handle object h2 = h; % Modify the handle object through one handle set(h, 'LineWidth', 2); % The change is reflected in the other handle as well assert(get(h, 'LineWidth') == get(h2, 'LineWidth')); % Define a value object a = [1 2 3; 4 5 6]; % Copy the value object a2 = a; % Modify the value object through one copy a(2,2) = 0; % The change is not reflected in the other copy assert(a(2,2) ~= a2(2,2));"
"21. What is a continuous-time signal and a discrete-time signal in MATLAB? How do you represent each? In MATLAB, signals can be classified as either continuous-time or discrete-time. A continuous-time signal is a signal whose amplitude is defined at every instant of time within a specific time interval. Continuous-time signals are represented using a function of time, usually denoted by the variable t. In MATLAB, such signals can be plotted using the ""plot"" function, which takes two vectors as arguments - one for the time values and one for the amplitude values. For example, the following code generates a sinusoidal continuous-time signal and plots it: t = 0:0.01:2*pi; % time vector x = sin(t); % amplitude vector plot(t,x); % plot the signal MATLAB Interview Questions A Discrete-time signal is a signal whose amplitude is only defined at discrete time instants. Discrete-time signals, on the other hand, are represented using a sequence of values, usually denoted by the variable n. In MATLAB, such signals can be plotted using the ""stem"" function, which takes two vectors as arguments - one for the sample indices and one for the amplitude values. For example, the following code generates a random discrete-time signal and plots it: n = 0:9; % sample indices x = randn(size(n)); % amplitude vector stem(n,x); % plot the signal"
"22. How do you use the eval function in MATLAB? What are some potential drawbacks of using it? The eval function in MATLAB is used for evaluating a string or character vector as if it were a MATLAB command. For example, Suppose we have a string ""x = 5+3"" and we pass it to the eval function, MATLAB will execute the command ""x = 5+3"". Consider the below code - str = “disp(""Hello world"")”; eval(str); eval(""x = 5+3"") This code will output ""Hello world"" to the command window and assign 8 to variable x. Eval function in Matlab also has some drawbacks, Some of them are - MATLAB Interview Questions Security risks: It can be used to execute arbitrary code, which can be a potential security risk if the code being evaluated is not carefully checked. Readability: The code that uses eval can be diﬀicult to read and understand, especially if the evaluated code is complex or long. Debugging: Debugging code that uses eval can be diﬀicult because the evaluated code is not visible in the source code. Performance: eval can be slower than alternative approaches, such as vectorization or pre-allocation, especially when used with large datasets."
"23. Explain in detail the concept of Error Handling in MATLAB. Error handling is an important part of programming, as it allows the handling of abnormal termination of programs that may occur during program execution. MATLAB provides a range of tools for error handling -"
"1. The try-catch block is a common method used to catch errors in MATLAB. It allows you to specify a block of code that should be executed, and if an error occurs, a corresponding catch block will be executed. This catch block can then be used to handle the error, such as by displaying an error message to the user or taking corrective action. For example, consider the below code: try data = load('data.mat'); result = process_data(data); catch ex disp(['An error occurred: ' ex.message]); end In this code, the try block attempts to load the data from a file and process it. If an error occurs, means if the file is not found or it cannot be opened, the catch block will be executed. This block displays an error message to the user, which may help them to diagnose and correct the problem. MATLAB Interview Questions"
"2. Other than try-catch, MATLAB also provides a range of functions for error handling, such as the error and warning functions. These are used to generate an error message and terminate program execution, while the warning function can be used to display a warning message to the user without stopping the program. For Example - Error Functions: if x < 0 error('Input must be non-negative.'); end This will display an error message and terminate the program if the condition is not met. Warning Functions: if x > 100 warning('Input value is very high.'); end This will display a warning message if the condition is met, but the program will continue running."
"3. Other than these, MATLAB also provides assertions, which are statements that check that a particular condition is true during program execution. If the assertion fails, an error message will be displayed and program execution will be terminated. Assertions are useful for verifying that your code is working as intended and can help you catch bugs early in the development process. For Example: assert(isnumeric(x), 'Input must be numeric.'); This will check if the condition is true, and if not, it will display an error message and terminate the program. In this case, the assertion checks if the input x is numeric, and displays an error message if it is not. MATLAB Interview Questions"
"24. What is the diﬀerence between a MEX file and a MATLAB function? How do you create and use MEX files? MEX Files MATLAB Functions Compiled C/C++ code.Interpreted MATLAB code.

It can be used to check what variables have been defined and loaded into the workspace. whos - The whos command is similar to the who command but provides more detailed information about each variable, such as its size, data type, and memory usage. It is useful for checking the memory usage of variables, especially when working with large data sets. pi - The pi command returns the value of the mathematical constant pi (approximately 3.1416). It can be used in mathematical computations and is o"
26. Explain Stress Analysis in MATLAB. Stress analysis in MATLAB refers to the process of using MATLAB so
"27. How do you optimize a function in MATLAB? What are some optimization techniques? In MATLAB, we can optimize a function using various optimization techniques. Here are some commonly used optimization techniques: MATLAB Interview Questions Gradient-based methods: Gradient-based optimization methods use the gradient of the objective function to search for the optimum. Examples include the steepest descent method, conjugate gradient method, and Newton's method. Genetic algorithms: Genetic algorithms are optimization algorithms that are inspired by the process of natural selection. They use a population of candidate solutions that evolve over time to find the global optimum. Particle swarm optimization: Particle swarm optimization is an optimization algorithm that is inspired by the behaviour of birds and fish. It uses a population of particles that move around the search space to find the optimum. Simulated annealing: Simulated annealing is an optimization algorithm that is inspired by the process of annealing in metallurgy. It uses a random walk through the search space to find the optimum, with a decreasing probability of accepting worse solutions over time. Interior point methods: Interior point methods are optimization algorithms that solve convex optimization problems by finding the optimal solution as the limit of a sequence of interior points. FAQs"

PHP Interview Questions Variables Constants The value of a variable can be changed during the execution.The constant value can’t be changed during script execution. Variables require compulsory usage of the $ sign at the start.No dollar sign ($) is required before using a constant. It is possible to define a variable by simple assignment.Constants can’t be defined by simple assignments. They are defined using the define() function. The default scope is the current access scope.Constants can be accessed throughout without any scoping rules.
"2. What is a session in PHP? A session in PHP is a way to store information to be used across multiple pages of an entire website. The information is not stored on the user’s computer, unlike cookies. In a temporary directory on the server, a file will be created by the session where registered session variables and their values are stored. This information will be available to all pages on the site during that visit. When you work with an application, you open it, do some modifications, and then you close it. This is much like a Session. The computer knows who you are. It knows when the application is started and ended by you. PHP Interview Questions But on the internet, the webserver does not know who you are or what you do, because the HTTP address doesn’t maintain a state. This problem is solved using session variables by storing user information to be used across multiple pages (e.g. username, favorite color, etc). By default, session variables will last until the user closes the browser. So Session variables hold single user information and are available to all pages in one application."
3. What does PEAR stands for? PEAR stands for “PHP Extension and Application Repository”. PEAR is a framework and repository for all of the reusable PHP components. PEAR provides a higher level of programming for web developers. It contains all kinds of PHP code snippets and libraries. It also provides you with a command-line interface to automatically install packages.
4. Explain the diﬀerence between dollar message and $$message. The main diﬀerence between the $message and $$message is given below: PHP Interview Questions $message $$message $message is a regular variable.$$message is a reference variable. It has a fixed name and stores a fixed value.It stores data about the variable. Data stored in $message is fixed.The value of the $$message can change dynamically as the value of the variable changes.
"5. Is PHP a case-sensitive language? PHP can be considered as a partial case-sensitive language. The variable names are completely case-sensitive but function names are not. Also, user-defined functions are not case-sensitive but the rest of the language is case-sensitive. For example, user-defined functions in PHP can be defined in lowercase but later referred to in uppercase, and it would still function normally."
"6. What are the diﬀerent types of variables present in PHP? PHP Interview Questions Types of PHP Variables There are 8 primary data types in PHP which are used to construct the variables. They are: Integers: Integers are whole numbers without a floating-point. Ex: 1253. Doubles: Doubles are floating-point numbers. Ex: 7.876 Booleans: It represents two logical states- true or false. NULL: NULL is a special type that only has one value, NULL. When no value is assigned to a variable, it can be assigned with NULL. Arrays: Array is a named and ordered collection of similar type of data. Ex: $colors = array(""red"", ""yellow"", ""blue""); Strings: Strings are a sequence of characters. Ex: “Hello InterviewBit!” Resources: Resources are special variables that consist of references to resources external to PHP(such as database connections). Objects: An instance of classes containing data and functions. Ex: $mango = new Fruit();"
"7. What are the rules for naming a PHP variable? The following two rules are needed to be followed while naming a PHP variable: PHP Interview Questions A variable must start with a dollar symbol, followed by the variable name. For example: $price=100; where price is a variable name. Variable names must begin with a letter or underscore. A variable name can consist of letters, numbers, or underscores. But you cannot use characters like + , – , % , & etc. A PHP variable name cannot contain spaces. PHP variables are case-sensitive. So $NAME and $name both are treated as diﬀerent variables."
"8. What is the diﬀerence between “echo” and “print” in PHP? The main diﬀerence between echo and print in PHP are given below: echo print echo can output one or more strings.print can only output one string and it always returns 1. echo is faster than print because it does not return any value.print is slower compared to echo. If you want to pass more than one parameter to echo, a parenthesis should be used.Use of parenthesis is not required with the argument list."
"9. Tell me some of the disadvantages of PHP The cons of PHP are: PHP Interview Questions PHP is not suitable for giant content-based web applications. Since it is open-source, it is not secure. Because ASCII text files are easily available. Change or modification in the core behavior of online applications is not allowed by PHP. If we use more features of the PHP framework and tools, it will cause poor performance of online applications. PHP features a poor quality of handling errors. PHP lacks debugging tools, which are needed to look for warnings and errors. It has only a few debugging tools in comparison to other programming languages. Intermediate Interview Questions"
"10. How can PHP and HTML interact? PHP scripts have the ability to generate HTML, and it is possible to pass information from HTML to PHP. PHP is a server-side language whereas HTML is a client-side language. So PHP executes on the server-side and gets its results as strings, objects, arrays, and then we use them to display its values in HTML. This interaction helps bridge the gaps and use the best of both languages."
"11. What is the purpose of @ in PHP? In PHP, @ is used for suppressing error messages. If any runtime error occurs on the line which consists @ symbol at the beginning, then the error will be handled by PHP."
12. Explain the importance of Parser in PHP? A PHP parser is so
13. What are the diﬀerent types of Array in PHP? There are 3 main types of arrays that are used in PHP: PHP Interview Questions Types of Arrays in PHP Indexed Array An array with a numeric key is known as the indexed array. Values are stored and accessed in linear order. PHP Interview Questions Indexed Array Associative Array An array with strings for indexing elements is known as the associative array. Element values are stored in association with key values rather than in strict linear index order. PHP Interview Questions Associative Array Multidimensional Array An array containing one or more arrays within itself is known as a multidimensional array. The values are accessed using multiple indices. Multidimensional Array PHP Interview Questions
"14. Explain the main types of errors. The 3 main types of errors in PHP are: Notices: Notices are non-critical errors that can occur during the execution of the script. These are not visible to users. Example: Accessing an undefined variable. Warnings: These are more critical than notices. Warnings don’t interrupt the script execution. By default, these are visible to the user. Example: include() a file that doesn’t exist. Fatal: This is the most critical error type which, when occurs, immediately terminates the execution of the script. Example: Accessing a property of a non- existent object or require() a non-existent file."
15. What are traits? Traits are a mechanism that lets you create reusable code in PHP and similar languages where multiple inheritances are not supported. It’s not possible to instantiate it on its own. A trait is intended to reduce the limitations of single inheritance by enabling a developer to reuse sets of methods freely in many independent classes living in diﬀerent hierarchies of class.
"16. Does JavaScript interact with PHP? JavaScript is a client-side programming language, whereas PHP is a server-side scripting language. PHP has the ability to generate JavaScript variables, and this can be executed easily in the browser. Thereby making it possible to pass variables to PHP using a simple URL."
"17. How does the ‘foreach’ loop work in PHP? The foreach statement is a looping construct that is used in PHP to iterate and loop through the array data type. The working of foreach is simple, with every single pass of the value, elements get assigned a value, and pointers are incremented. This process is repeatedly done until the end of the array has been reached. PHP Interview Questions The syntax for using the foreach statement in PHP is given below: foreach($array as $value) { Code inside the loop; }"
"18. What is the most used method for hashing passwords in PHP? The crypt() function is used for this functionality as it provides a large number of hashing algorithms that can be used. These algorithms include sha1, sha256, or md5 which are designed to be very fast and eﬀicient."
"19. What is the diﬀerence between the include() and require() functions? include() function This function is used to copy all the contents of a file called within the function, text wise into a file from which it is called. When the file is included cannot be found, it will only produce a warning (E_WARNING) and the script will continue the execution. require() function: The require() function performs same as the include() function. It also takes the file that is required and copies the whole code into the file from where the require() function is called. When the file is included cannot be found, it will produce a fatal error (E_COMPILE_ERROR) and terminates the script."
"20. What are cookies? How to create cookies in PHP? A cookie is a small record that the server installs on the client’s computer. They store data about a user on the browser. It is used to identify a user and is embedded on the user’s computer when they request a particular page. Each time a similar PC asks for a page with a program, it will send the cookie as well.

It has a license cost associated with it.PHP is open-source and freely available. PHP Interview Questions
"22. What is the meaning of ‘escaping to PHP’? The PHP parsing engine needs a way to diﬀerentiate PHP code from other page elements. The mechanism to achieve this is known as ‘escaping to PHP’. Escaping a string means reducing ambiguity in quotes used in that string. For example, when you’re defining a string, you surround it in either double quotes or single quotes: ""Hello, InterviewBit."" But what if I include double quotes within the string? ""Hello ""InterviewBit."""" Now I have ambiguity - the interpreter doesn’t know where does my string end. If I want to keep my double quotes, I have various options. I could use single quotes around my string: 'Hello ""InterviewBit.""' Or I can escape my quotes: ""Hello \\""InterviewBit.\\"""" Any quote that is preceded by a slash is escaped and understood to be part of the value of the string."
"23. Explain Path Traversal Path traversal is a form of attack to read into the files of a web application. '../' (dot- dot-sequences) is a cross-platform symbol to go up in the directory. Path traversal makes use of this symbol to operate the web application file. The attacker can reveal the content of the file attacked using the path traversal outside the root directory of a web server or application. It is usually done to gain access to secret passwords, tokens, and other sensitive information stored in the files. Path Traversal is also called “Directory Traversal”. It allows the attacker to exploit vulnerabilities present in the web file under attack. Let’s take a simple example. Consider we have a “Show File” button that opens up some URL. PHP Interview Questions For a classic directory traversal attack, the attacker may try to access the system file /etc/passwd (assuming a UNIX/LINUX system). If the application receives the value of the file parameter from the URL and passes it to a system call, it would traverse the relative path ../../etc/passwd starting from /var/www and ask the system to load the password file. This technique is also called a dot-dot-slash attack, because it usually uses the special characters ../ (or \\.. on Windows) to climb to a higher-level directory."
"24. What is the meaning of a final method and a final class? The final keyword in a declaration of the method indicates that the method cannot be overridden by subclasses. A class that is declared as final cannot be subclassed. This is especially useful when we are creating an immutable class like the String class. Only classes and methods may be declared final, properties cannot be declared as final. PHP Interview Questions For Experienced"

"26. What is the use of session_start() and session_destroy() functions in PHP? The session_start() function is used to start a new session. Also, it can resume an existing session if it is stopped. In this particular case, the return will be the current session if resumed. Syntax: PHP Interview Questions session_start(); The session_destroy() function is used to destroy all of the session variables as given below: <?php session_start(); session_destroy(); ?>"
"27. What is Memcache and Memcached in PHP? Is it possible to share a single instance of a Memcache between several projects of PHP? Memcached is an eﬀicient caching daemon designed specifically for decreasing database load in dynamic web applications. Memcache oﬀers a handy procedural and object-oriented interface to Memcached. Memcache is a memory storage space. We can run Memcache on a single or several servers. Therefore, it is possible to share a single instance of Memcache between multiple projects. It is possible to configure a client to speak to a separate set of instances. Therefore, it is allowed to run two diﬀerent Memcache processes on the same host. Despite running on the same host, both of such Memcache processes stay independent, unless there is a partition of data."
"28. What are the diﬀerent ways of handling the result set of MySQL in PHP? There are 4 ways of handling the result set of MySQL in PHP. They are: PHP Interview Questions mysqli_fetch_array(): Returns the current row of the result set as an associative array, a numeric array, or both. mysqli_fetch_assoc(): Returns the current row of the result set as an associative array. mysqli_fetch_object(): Returns the current row of a result set, as an object. mysqli_fetch_row(): Returns result row as an enumerated array."
"29. How to connect to a URL in PHP? Any URL can be connected to PHP easily by making use of the library called cURL. This comes as a default library with the standard installation of PHP. The term cURL stands for client-side URL. cURL make use of libcurl(client-side URL Transfer Library) which supports many protocols like FTP, FTPS, HTTP/1, HTTP POST, HTTP PUT, HTTP proxy, HTTPS, IMAP, Kerberos etc. It allows you to connect to a URL and retrieve and display information from that page – like the HTML content of the page, HTTP headers, and their associated data, etc. Steps for connecting with URL using PHP cURL POST are given below: Initialize cURL session.

"33. Explain type hinting in PHP In PHP, type hinting is used to specify the expected data type (arrays, objects, interface, etc.) for an argument in a function declaration. It was introduced in PHP 5. Whenever the function is called, PHP checks if the arguments are of a user-preferred type or not. If the argument is not of the specified type, the run time will display an error and the program will not execute. It is helpful in better code organization and improved error messages. Example usage:"

"3. What is a data model? What are its types? A data model is an information schema that sorts and normalizes diﬀerent information components and establishes relations between them. These models subsequently become tables in the database which can be retrieved and processed based on the organization’s requirements. There are three types of data models, they are: Data Modelling Interview Questions Conceptual data model: This type of model focuses on high-level, abstract and users view of data representation. It defines what the system contains and is created by data architects and business stakeholders. The main purpose of this model is data organization and defining the scope and business rules. Following are the characteristics of the conceptual data model: This provides an overall overview of data structure in terms of business context. Contains some concepts that are not required for database implementation but are required for a business for understanding the need for features in the applications. Represents data needed for performing business processes and operations. Physical data model: In this model, we define the database schema and how the data is stored in the database physically. Following are the characteristics of the physical data model: It describes the data required for the application. It can be integrated with diﬀerent physical models depending on the scope of the application. This defines relationships between diﬀerent tables which addresses cardinality and nullability of relationships. This model is developed for specific DBMS versions, data storage, locations or technologies used in the application. This model also consists of exact data types, constraints, lengths and default values. It also defines primary and foreign key references, indexes, views, profiles and authorizations. Logical data models: This data model lies between the conceptual and physical model and describes the logical representation of data. Following are the characteristics of the model: It describes the data needs of a project and can also be integrated with other logical models depending on the scope of the application which in turn guides the physical model. This data model is designed and developed independently from DBMS. It also consists of attributes like data types and exact length and precisions. It contains normalization processes of the model and is applied till it achieves 3NF. Data Modelling Interview Questions"
4. What do you understand by dimension in data? Dimensions represent the set of unique values that are useful for identifying and categorizing the data from the data warehouse.
5. What is granularity? Granularity represents the information level stored in a database table. It can be high or low level with tables that contain transaction-level or fact table respectively. Granularity is also a measure of smallest set of data which can be independently processed by any component/task/application.
6. What do you mean by data sparsity? Data sparsity refers to the number of empty cells in the database. It represents how much data is available for a particular dimension in a data model. Inadequate information leads to large space consumption for saving aggregations.
7. What is hashing? Hashing is a technique that helps to search index values to retrieve required data. It is used for calculating the direct location of data using indexing.

"12. What is the significance of metadata? Metadata is the information about data that tells what data kind is stored in the system, what is the purpose and to whom it is intended. There are diﬀerent types of metadata depending on the purpose, they are: Data Modelling Interview Questions Technical Metadata – This type defines names of the database system and tables, size of tables, values, attributes, data types etc. It also includes constraint information like primary keys, foreign keys, indexes etc. Business Metadata – This data is specific to business and defines the data ownership, business regulations and rules, policies etc. Descriptive Metadata – This type of data gives information about folder, file, image, book or video. Information can be title, date, size, author, published on etc. Operational Metadata – This type includes information related to any business operation and is used by managers or executives for performing any task."
"13. What is a Relational Database? A relational database is a digital database system that is based on a relational data model and is useful for storing data in tables. Oracle, Teradata, MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite etc are types of relational databases. The data is transformed into rows and columns which is standardized and can be queried with SQL. RDBMS helps to add/ alter tables and column data into the database systematically by maintaining data integrity."
14. What is cardinality? Cardinality represents the level of uniqueness of data values present in a column. The high value of cardinality tells us that the column has a large percentage of unique values. Low cardinality indicates that the data is repeated (duplicated) in the column.
15. What is Normalization? The process of structuring a relational database based on a series of normal forms for reducing data redundancy and increasing data integrity is called Normalization. It divides larger tables into smaller ones and links them using references/relationships. This helps in reducing data repetition and ensuring it is stored logically. The following image represents the process of normalization: Data Modelling Interview Questions
16. What is Denormalization? Denormalization is the opposite of normalization which helps in improving the read performance by compensating the write performance by adding redundant data copies. It has duplicate data entries in the database for increasing the performance of read-heavy loads.
"17. What is a NoSQL database? NoSQL database is a type of database that does not require a fixed schema. It is non- relational and non-relational and usually avoids joins in preference of schema variation for achieving better performance. It is also very easy to scale based on the application’s needs. NoSQL is used for storing huge data in a distributed manner. NoSQL Databases are of four types: Data Modelling Interview Questions Column-based - These organize data in columns instead of rows. The rows in these databases have many columns associated with them. These are useful in fraud detection systems, catalogues, recommendation engines etc. Example: Cassandra, Hypertable, Hbase, Amazon DynamoDB etc Graph-based - These organize data into nodes and edges. The edges show connections between diﬀerent nodes. It is multi-relational. These are mostly used in social networks, Logistic domain etc. Example: Neo4J, OrientDB, Infinite Graph, FlockDB etc Document-based - These types store semi-structured data in the form of documents. These are similar to key-value type databases and the diﬀerence is that the values in this type store values in the form of JSON, BSON, XML etc. Example: MongoDB, RavenDB, Terrastore etc Key-value - Simple NoSQL data model consisting of unique keys and values linked with it. It performs eﬀiciently and is highly scalable. Redis and Memcached are some examples of this database type and is mostly used in caching applications, session management.

"21. What are the phases in the data modelling development cycle? There are 5 phases in data modelling: Data Modelling Interview Questions Gather Business Requirements: The first phase is to gather the functional requirements and what are the reporting needs from the business analysts and the end-users. Conceptual Data Modeling(CDM): Then depending on the requirements, come up with a conceptual data model that includes major entities and relationships between them. This model will be used in the Initial Planning Phase. Logical Data Modeling(LDM): Post the creation of a conceptual model, create a logical data model that describes the logical representation of the business requirements in the organization. Physical Data Modeling(PDM): Here, we create a complete data model which includes required tables, columns in them, relationships between diﬀerent entities and properties for the implementation of the database. Database: Based on the physical data model created, the SQL codes would be generated with the help of the data modelling tools and these codes (queries) are then executed on the server for creating the database entities."
"22. What do you understand by Star schema? A schema usually represents the data structure illustration and relationships between diﬀerent structures. A star schema constitutes a central fact table and diﬀerent dimension tables connected to it. The primary key of the dimension tables is a foreign key in the central fact table. This schema is called a star schema because the entity-relationship diagram can be visualized as a star whose points diverge from the central fact table as shown below: Data Modelling Interview Questions The central fact table has two column sets- one set belongs to the fact table and the others are foreign keys to the dimension tables. Dimensions symbolize one or more attributes/hierarchies that categorize data. If there are no hierarchies, they are called lists or flat dimensions. The dimensional tables are smaller in size when compared to the fact table. For example, The fact tables can store the entire sales information and the dimension tables store data about clients, products, geographic regions, channels etc that are linked as foreign key references to the Sales information fact table."
23. Explain snowflake schema database design. A snowflake schema is a schema that has one or more dimension tables that do not connect directly to the fact table but should be interacting with it via other dimension tables. The process of normalizing dimension tables in STAR schema to resemble a snowflake-like structure with the fact table at the centre is called snowflaking. It is represented in the image below: Data Modelling Interview Questions The tables in the snowflake schema are normalized to 3NF form and each dimension level in the schema represents one level in the hierarchy. The central fact table is linked to multiple dimension tables that can be linked to other dimension tables via many-to-many or many-to-one relationships. The schema is useful for enhancing the query performance as there are minimum disk requirements and the joining of smaller lookup tables.
"24. What are the critical relationship types in a Data Model? A relationship is normally used for connecting parent and child tables. There are 3 types of critical relationships in a data model, they are: Data Modelling Interview Questions Identifying: In this type, a reference column of a child’s table these are connected by a thick line is part of the primary key of the parent table which helps in identifying the records. This relationship is usually replaced by a thick line. These are called identifying because the foreign key can never change as it becomes part of the primary key. A child object cannot exist if there is no parent object. Non-identifying: Here, the reference column of a child table is not part of the primary key of the parent. This relationship is represented by a dotted line. This relationship can be optional or mandatory depending on the requirements. It means that the foreign key columns can (if optional) or cannot allow (if mandatory) NULL. Self-recursive: Here, a standalone column is connected to a primary key in the same table. This relationship is between diﬀerent column instances of the same entity type."
"25. What are the types of visual data modelling techniques? There are two types of visual techniques in data modelling, they are: Data Modelling Interview Questions Entity-Relationship (ER) Model: This is a data modelling methodology that designs traditional databases and aids in performing data normalization by reducing data redundancy. It helps in database schema visualization of top-level data view. The data modelling architect identifies the following: Entities and their attributes that represent objects/tables in the relational databases. Relationships between the entities. UML (Unified Modelling Language): UML is a general-purpose language used in database modelling, development and visualization in so"
"26. How can you relate CAP Theorem to database design? CAP(Consistency-Availability-Partition Tolerance) theorem says that a distributed system cannot guarantee C, A and P simultaneously. It can at max provide any 2 of the 3 guarantees. Consistency: This states that the data has to remain consistent a"
"27. What Are Recursive Relationships? Recursive relationships occur when there is a relationship between an entity and itself. These relationships are complex and would require more complex approaches of mapping the data to a schema. Consider an instance where a doctor is marked as a care provider in the health care database. Now if the doctor himself falls sick, he needs to go to another doctor as a patient which results in recursive relationships. To accommodate this, we add a foreign key to the health centre’s number in every patient’s record. Care needs to be taken for ensuring that the recursion has an exit path in such entity relations."
28. What is dimensional modelling? Data Modelling Interview Questions Dimensional Modeling is a technique of data structuring performed for optimizing the data storage and faster data retrieval in the data warehouse. It consists of 2 types of tables - fact tables and dimension tables. The fact tables are used for storing diﬀerent transactional data along with the foreign keys from the dimension tables qualifying the data. The purpose of Dimensional modelling is to achieve faster data retrieval and not the highest degree of normalization.
"29. What are the types of dimensions in data modelling? There are 5 types of dimensions, they are: Data Modelling Interview Questions Conformed dimension: These are the dimensions that are used in multiple tables in a database by allowing measures and facts to be categorized and described consistently across other facts or data marts. Junk dimension: Here the attributes do not belong to the fact table or any existing dimension table. They are usually text or are like flags indicating ‘Y’ or ‘N’ (yes or no) or true or false. Role-playing dimension: Here, there are multiple relationships valid between itself and other tables. It is used for deciding how the roles can be used with other facts which do not share the same concepts. Slowly changing dimension: These have attributes that change over time and also include dimensions where data is preserved or replaced in history. Degenerated dimension: These dimensions do not have their dimension tables but are part of the primary key in the fact table."
"30. How can you perform reverse engineering in data modelling? Reverse engineering is the process of building a data model from an existing database. This is more beneficial in cases when an organization has an existing outdated database solution, then while performing tech modernization, instead of developing solutions from scratch, it becomes more eﬀicient to reconstruct the data model from an existing system and make tweaks to that data model as per the vision and apply that tweak to the current system. The steps in reverse engineering are summarised as follows:"
"31. What is the importance of the third normal form? Data Modelling Interview Questions The third normal form (3NF) is used for preventing data duplication and data abnormalities. A relation is said to have met the third normal form when there are no transitive dependencies for non-prime attributes as present in the second normal form. A 3NF relation is said to have achieved if any one of the below conditions are met for every non-trivial functional dependency A->B: A- super key B- prime attribute where every attribute is a part of candidate key For a table to achieve 3NF form, it should first be in 1NF (First Normal Form) and achieve 2NF (Second Normal Form). The rows in the table should be dependent only on the keys. If the contents of fields apply to more than 1 primary key, then they should be put in another table. For instance, if a patient’s records have a doctor’s phone number stored with the patient’s details, it doesn’t meet the 3NF standards. Because the doctor’s number should be part of the doctor table for avoiding duplication in the patient table because a doctor can have more than one patient."

"4. What are the diﬀerent versions of the cloud? There are two primary deployment models of the cloud: Public and Private. Cloud Computing Interview Questions Public Cloud: The set of hardware, networking, storage, services, applications, and interfaces owned and operated by a third party for use by other companies or individuals is the public cloud. These commercial providers create a highly scalable data center that hides the details of the underlying infrastructure from the consumer. Public clouds are viable because they oﬀer many options for computing, storage, and a rich set of other services. Private Cloud: The set of hardware, networking, storage, services, applications, and interfaces owned and operated by an organization for the use of its employees, partners, or customers is the private cloud. This can be created and managed by a third party for the exclusive use of one enterprise. The private cloud is a highly controlled environment not open for public consumption. Thus, it sits behind a firewall. Hybrid Cloud: Most companies use a combination of private computing resources and public services, called the hybrid cloud environment. Multi-Cloud: Some companies, in addition, also use a variety of public cloud services to support the diﬀerent developer and business units – called a multi- cloud environment."

Each microservice runs a unique process and communicates through well-defined and standardized APIs, once created. These services are defined in the form of a catalog so that developers can easily locate the right service and also understand the governance rules for usage. Cloud Computing Interview Questions"
"15. Why are microservices important for a true cloud environment? The reason why microservices are so important for a true cloud environment is because of these four key benefits: Each microservice is built to serve a specific and limited purpose, and hence application development is simplified. Small development teams can then focus on writing code for some of the narrowly defined and easily understood functions. Code changes will be smaller and less complex than with a complex integrated application, making it easier and faster to make changes, whether to fix a problem or to upgrade service with new requirements. Scalability — S calability makes it easier to deploy an additional instance of a service or change that service as needs evolve. Microservices are fully tested and validated. When new applications leverage existing microservices, developers can assume the integrity of the new application without the need for continual testing."

"33. What is Dogpile eﬀect? How can it be prevented? It is also referred to as cache stampede which can occur when huge parallel computing systems employing caching strategies are subjected to very high load. It is referred to as that event that occurs when the cache expires (or invalidated) and multiple requests are hit to the website at the same time. The most common way of preventing dogpiling is by implementing semaphore locks in the cache. When the cache expires in this system, the first process to acquire the lock would generate the new value to the cache."
"34. What are the steps to be undertaken to configure git repository so that it runs the code sanity checking tooks before any commits? How do you prevent it from happening again if the sanity testing fails? DevOps Interview Questions Sanity testing, also known as smoke testing, is a process used to determine if it’s reasonable to proceed to test. Git repository provides a hook called pre-commit which gets triggered right before a commit happens. A simple script by making use of this hook can be written to achieve the smoke test. The script can be used to run other tools like linters and perform sanity checks on the changes that would be committed into the repository. The following snippet is an example of one such script: #!/bin/sh files=$(git diff –cached –name-only –diff-filter=ACM | grep ‘.py$’) if [ -z files ]; then exit 0 fi unfmtd=$(pyfmt -l $files) if [ -z unfmtd ]; then exit 0 fi echo “Some .py files are not properly fmt’d” exit 1 The above script checks if any .py files which are to be committed are properly formatted by making use of the python formatting tool pyfmt. If the files are not properly formatted, then the script prevents the changes to be committed to the repository by exiting with status 1."

In this case, the emphasis is on finding unusual records, detecting dependencies, and analyzing clusters. It also involves analyzing large datasets to determine trends and patterns in them. Data Profiling Process: It generally involves analyzing that data's individual attributes. In this case, the emphasis is on providing useful information on data attributes such as data type, frequency, etc. Additionally, it also facilitates the discovery and evaluation of enterprise metadata. Data Analyst Interview Questions Data Mining Data Profiling It involves analyzing a pre-built database to identify patterns.It involves analyses of raw data from existing datasets. It also analyzes existing databases and large datasets to convert raw data into useful information.In this, statistical or informative summaries of the data are collected. It usually involves finding hidden patterns and seeking out new, useful, and non-trivial data to generate useful information. It usually involves the evaluation of data sets to ensure consistency, uniqueness, and logic. Data mining is incapable of identifying inaccurate or incorrect data values.In data profiling, erroneous data is identified during the initial stage of analysis.

Outliers are detected using two methods: Box Plot Method: According to this method, the value is considered an outlier if it exceeds or falls below 1.5*IQR (interquartile range), that is, if it lies above the top quartile (Q3) or below the bottom quartile (Q1). Standard Deviation Method: According to this method, an outlier is defined as a value that is greater or lower than the mean ± (3*standard deviation)."
"11. Write diﬀerence between data analysis and data mining. Data Analysis: It generally involves extracting, cleansing, transforming, modeling, and visualizing data in order to obtain useful and important information that may contribute towards determining conclusions and deciding what to do next. Analyzing data has been in use since the 1960s.

It is possible to misuse the information obtained with data analytics by targeting people with certain political beliefs or ethnicities."
"21. Explain Collaborative Filtering. Data Analyst Interview Questions Based on user behavioral data, collaborative filtering (CF) creates a recommendation system. By analyzing data from other users and their interactions with the system, it filters out information. This method assumes that people who agree in their evaluation of particular items will likely agree again in the future. Collaborative filtering has three major components: users- items- interests. Example: Collaborative filtering can be seen, for instance, on online shopping sites when you see phrases such as ""recommended for you”."
"22. What do you mean by Time Series Analysis? Where is it used? In the field of Time Series Analysis (TSA), a sequence of data points is analyzed over an interval of time. Instead of just recording the data points intermittently or randomly, analysts record data points at regular intervals over a period of time in the TSA. It can be done in two diﬀerent ways: in the frequency and time domains. As TSA has a broad scope of application, it can be used in a variety of fields. TSA plays a vital role in the following places: Statistics Signal processing Econometrics Weather forecasting Earthquake prediction Astronomy Applied science"

"25. What do you mean by univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis? Data Analyst Interview Questions Univariate Analysis: The word uni means only one and variate means variable, so a univariate analysis has only one dependable variable. Among the three analyses, this is the simplest as the variables involved are only one. Example: A simple example of univariate data could be height as shown below: Bivariate Analysis: The word Bi means two and variate mean variables, so a bivariate analysis has two variables. It examines the causes of the two variables and the relationship between them. It is possible that these variables are dependent on or independent of each other. Example: A simple example of bivariate data could be temperature and ice cream sales in the summer season. Data Analyst Interview Questions Multivariate Analysis: In situations where more than two variables are to be analyzed simultaneously, multivariate analysis is necessary. It is similar to bivariate analysis, except that there are more variables involved."

Logistic Regression is basically a mathematical model that can be used to study datasets with one or more independent variables that determine a particular outcome. By studying the relationship between multiple independent variables, the model predicts a dependent data variable."
"29. What do you mean by the K-means algorithm? One of the most famous partitioning methods is K-mean. With this unsupervised learning algorithm, the unlabeled data is grouped in clusters. Here, 'k' indicates the number of clusters. It tries to keep each cluster separated from the other. Since it is an unsupervised model, there will be no labels for the clusters to work with."
"30. Write the diﬀerence between variance and covariance. Variance: In statistics, variance is defined as the deviation of a data set from its mean value or average value. When the variances are greater, the numbers in the data set are farther from the mean. When the variances are smaller, the numbers are nearer the mean. Variance is calculated as follows: Data Analyst Interview Questions Here, X represents an individual data point, U represents the average of multiple data points, and N represents the total number of data points. Covariance: Covariance is another common concept in statistics, like variance. In statistics, covariance is a measure of how two random variables change when compared with each other. Covariance is calculated as follows: Here, X represents the independent variable, Y represents the dependent variable, x- bar represents the mean of the X, y-bar represents the mean of the Y, and N represents the total number of data points in the sample."

What are the real-time use cases and the eﬀiciency of the so"
"4. What are the types of design patterns in Java? There are three types of design patterns. They are: Creational Patterns: These patterns provide freedom of choice between creating objects by hiding the logic. The objects constructed are decoupled from the implemented system. Some of the examples of creational patterns are - Factory design pattern, Builder design, Prototype design, Singleton design, Abstract Factory design. Structural Patterns: These patterns help in defining how the structures of classes and objects should be like for defining the composition between classes, interfaces and objects. Some of the examples of structural patterns are - Adaptor design, Facade design, Decorator design, proxy design etc. Behavioural Patterns: These patterns help to define how the objects should communicate and interact with one another. Some of the examples of behavioural patterns are - Command pattern, Iterator pattern, Observer pattern, Strategy pattern, etc. The following diagram represents the summary of the types of design patterns. Design Patterns Interview Questions"
"5. What is Inversion of Control? Inversion of control is a pattern used to decouple the dependencies between layers and components in the system. The Dependency-Injection (DI) pattern is an example of an IoC pattern that helps in removing dependencies in the code. Let us understand this with the help of an example. Consider we have a class A that makes use of class B as shown below: public class A{ private B b; public A(){ this.b = new B(); } } Here, we have a dependency between classes A and B. If we had the IoC pattern implemented, we would not have used the new operator to assign value to the dependent variable. It would have been something as shown below: Design Patterns Interview Questions public class A { private IocB b; public A(IocB b) { this.b = b; } } We have inverted the control of handing the dependency of instantiating the object of class B to the IoC class IocB."
"6. What Is Gang of Four (GOF) in Design Patterns? Gang of Four (GOF) are the 4 superheroes who invented the concept of design patterns. These heroes are Erich Gamma, Ralph Johnson, Richard Hel and John Vlissides. These people documented the design patterns in a book called “Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented So"
"7. What are the SOLID Principles? SOLID principles were the Object-Oriented principles introduced by Robert C. Martin in his paperwork “Design Principles and Design patterns” in the year 2000. The acronym for SOLID goes as follows: Design Patterns Interview Questions S - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): The single responsibility principle ensures that every class or module should be accountable and responsible for only one functionality. There should be one and only one reason for changing any class. O - Open Closed Principle (OCP): Every class is open for extension but closed for modification. Here, we are allowed to extend the entities behaviour by not modifying anything in the existing source code. L - Liskov Substitution Principle(LSP): LSP principle states that the objects can be replaced by the subtype instances without aﬀecting the correctness of the program. I - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): The ISP principle states that we can use as many interfaces specific to the client’s requirements instead of creating only one general interface. Clients should not be forced to implement the functionalities that they do not require. D - Dependency Inversion Principle: Here, the high-level modules should not be dependent on the lower level modules or concrete implementations. Instead, they should be dependent on the abstractions."
"8. What do you understand by the Open-Closed Principle (OCP)? Design Patterns Interview Questions The Open close principle states that any class, component or entity should be open for extension but closed for modification. A class can be extended via Inheritance, Interfaces, Composition whenever required instead of modifying the code of the class. Consider an instance where we have a class that calculates the area of a square. Later, we get the requirement of calculating the area of a rectangle. Here, instead of modifying the original class, we can create one base class and this base class can be extended by the new class rectangle."
"9. What are some of the design patterns used in Java’s JDK library? Following are some design patterns used in Java’s JDK library: Decorator pattern are used by the Wrapper classes. Singleton pattern is used in classes like Calendar and Runtime. Factory pattern is used for methods like Integer.valueOf methods in wrapper classes. Observer pattern is used for handling event frameworks like awt, swing etc."
10. How are design principles diﬀerent from design patterns? Design principles are those principles that are followed while designing so
11. How are design patterns diﬀerent from algorithms? Design Patterns Interview Questions Both Design Patterns and Algorithms describe typical solutions to any given problem. But the main diﬀerence is that the algorithm defines a clear set of actions for achieving a goal and a design pattern provides a high-level description of any solution. Design patterns applied to two diﬀerent problems might be the same but the logic of implementation would be diﬀerent and is based on the requirements. Design Patterns Interview Questions for Experienced
"12. What is a Factory Design Pattern? Factory design pattern belongs to the category of Creational Design Patterns. Here, the objects are created without exposing the logic of creation to the client. The objects refer to the common interface. Let us understand this with the help of an example. Let’s consider 3 classes Square, Rectangle and Triangle. We will be using factory patterns to create objects of these three classes without exposing the creation logic by making use of ShapeFactory class. The Driver class would be passing the information like RECTANGLE/SQUARE/TRIANGLE for getting the required object. The following UML diagram represents the scenario. Design Patterns Interview Questions Now to implement the factory design pattern for the above example, let us follow the below steps: Step 1: Create a Shape interface. //Shape.java public interface Shape { void draw(); } Step 2: Create concrete classes Rectangle, Square, Triangle that implements the Shape interface. //Rectangle.java public class Rectangle implements Shape { @Override public void draw() { System.out.println(""Rectangle Drawn""); } } Design Patterns Interview Questions //Square.java public class Square implements Shape { @Override public void draw() { System.out.println(""Square Drawn""); } } //Triangle.java public class Triangle implements Shape { @Override public void draw() { System.out.println(""Triangle Drawn""); } } Step 3: Create ShapeFactory class and create a method called getShapeInstance() for generating objects of the concrete classes defined above. //ShapeFactory.java public class ShapeFactory { //the method will be used to get object of required shape public Shape getShapeInstance(String type){ if(type == null){ return null; } if(type.equalsIgnoreCase(""TRIANGLE"")){ return new Triangle(); } else if(type.equalsIgnoreCase(""SQUARE"")){ return new Square(); } else if(type.equalsIgnoreCase(""RECTANGLE"")){ return new Rectangle(); } return null; } } Step 4: Implement the Driver class and utilise the factory class for getting the object of the required type. Design Patterns Interview Questions //Driver.java public class Driver { public static void main(String[] args) { ShapeFactory shapeFactory = new ShapeFactory(); //get Triangle object and call draw() Shape triangle = shapeFactory.getShape(""Triangle""); triangle.draw(); //get Rectangle object and call draw() Shape rectangle = shapeFactory.getShape(""RECTANGLE""); rectangle.draw(); //get Square object and call draw() Shape square = shapeFactory.getShape(""SQUARE""); square.draw(); } } Step 5: Validate the output The output of this implementation would be: Triangle Drawn Rectangle Drawn Square Drawn The advantages of a factory design pattern are: This pattern allows hiding the creation logic of the application by using interfaces and factory classes. It lets to test the seamlessness of the application by using mock or stubs. Introduces loose coupling in the application by allowing flexibility in the implementation of methods when new classes are introduced."
"13. What is an Adapter Design Pattern? The adapter design pattern falls under the category of a structural design pattern that lets incompatible objects collaborate. It acts as a wrapper between 2 diﬀerent objects. The adapter catches the call for one object and transforms them to be recognizable by the second object. Design Patterns Interview Questions Let us understand this with the help of an example of a USB to Ethernet adapter that is used when we have an ethernet interface at one end and the USB interface on the other end. The USB and ethernet are incompatible with each other which is why we require an adapter. The adapter class has a Client class that expects some object type and it has an Adaptee class that oﬀers the same feature but by exposing a diﬀerent interface. Now to make these both communicate, we have an Adapter class. The client requests the Adapter by using the target interface. The Adapter class translates the request using the Adaptee Interface on the adaptee. The Client receives the results unaware of the adapter’s role. This has been described in the class diagram as shown below: Class Diagram: Let us consider that we have a MediaPlayer Interface which is implemented by the AudioPlayer class. The AudioPlayer can play mp3 format by default. Consider another interface AdvancedPlayer that is being implemented by MP4Player class that plays mp4 formats and WAVPlayer that plays wav formats. If we want to make AudioPlayer class play other formats, then we make use of the MediaAdapter class that implements the MediaPlayer Interface and uses the AdvancedPlayer objects for playing the required format. The code implementation of this scenario is as follows: Design Patterns Interview Questions //MediaPlayer.java public interface MediaPlayer { public void play(String format, String file); } //AdvancedPlayer.java public interface AdvancedPlayer { public void playMp4(String file); public void playWav(String file); } //Mp4Player.java public class Mp4Player implements AdvancedPlayer{ @Override public void playMp4(String file) { System.out.println(""MP4 File ""+ file + "" Playing....""); } @Override public void playWav(String file) { //do nothing } } //WAVPlayer.java public class WAVPlayer implements AdvancedPlayer{ @Override public void playMp4(String file) { //do nothing } @Override public void playWav(String file) { System.out.println(""WAV File ""+ file + "" Playing....""); } } Design Patterns Interview Questions //MediaAdapter.java public class MediaAdapter implements MediaPlayer { AdvancedPlayer advancedPlayer; public MediaAdapter(String format){ if(format.equalsIgnoreCase(""mp4"") ){ advancedPlayer = new Mp4Player(); }else if(format.equalsIgnoreCase(""wav"") ){ advancedPlayer = new WAVPlayer(); } } @Override public void play(String format, String file) { if(format.equalsIgnoreCase(""mp4"")){ advancedPlayer.playMp4(file); } else if(format.equalsIgnoreCase(""wav"")){ advancedPlayer.playWav(file); } } } //AudioPlayer.java public class AudioPlayer implements MediaPlayer { MediaAdapter mediaAdapter; @Override public void play(String format, String file) { //inbuilt support to play mp3 music files if(format.equalsIgnoreCase(""mp3"")){ System.out.println(""MP3 file "" + file +"" Playing...""); } //Make use of Adapter to support different formats else if(format.equalsIgnoreCase(""wav"") || format.equalsIgnoreCase(""mp4"")){ mediaAdapter = new MediaAdapter(format); mediaAdapter.play(format, file); } else{ System.out.println(""Format not supported""); } } } Design Patterns Interview Questions //Driver.java public class Driver { public static void main(String[] args) { AudioPlayer audioPlayer = new AudioPlayer(); audioPlayer.play(""mp3"", ""music1.mp3""); audioPlayer.play(""wav"", ""music2.wav""); audioPlayer.play(""mp4"", ""music3.mp4""); audioPlayer.play(""avi"", ""music4.avi""); } } The output of this code would be: MP3 file music1.mp3 Playing... WAV File music2.wav Playing... MP4 File music3.mp4 Playing... Format not supported"
14. What is a Proxy Design Pattern? Proxy design pattern falls under the category of structural design that represents the functionality of other classes. This pattern lets the developers provide a substitute for another object. This is called a proxy object. This helps to control the access to the original object and allows us to perform many tasks before or a
"15. What is a Bridge Design Pattern? The bridge pattern is a type of structural design pattern that lets to split large class or closely related classes into 2 hierarchies - abstraction and implementation. These hierarchies are independent of each other and are used whenever we need to decouple an abstraction from implementation. This is called a Bridge pattern because it acts as a bridge between the abstract class and the implementation class. In this pattern, the abstract classes and the implementation classes can be altered or modified independently without aﬀecting the other one. Design Patterns Interview Questions The above image is the UML representation of the Bridge Pattern. There are 4 main elements of Bridge Pattern. They are: Abstraction – This is the core of the pattern and it defines its crux. This contains a reference to the implementer. Refined Abstraction – This extends the abstraction and takes refined details of the requirements and hides it from the implementors. Implementer – This is the interface for the implementation classes. Concrete Implementation – These are the concrete implementation classes that implement the Implementer interface."
"16. What are some instances where we prefer abstract classes over interfaces in Java? Both Abstract classes and interfaces in Java follow the principle of writing code for interface rather than the implementation. This principle ensures that flexibility is added to the code to tackle dynamic requirements. Some of the pointers for deciding what to prefer over what are as follows: Design Patterns Interview Questions Java lets to extend only one class and let’s implement multiple interfaces. If we extend one class then we cannot extend other classes. In such cases, it is better to implement the interfaces wherever possible and reserve the inheritance of classes to only important ones. Interfaces are used for representing the behaviour of the class. Java lets to implement multiple interfaces which is why we can take the help of interfaces to help classes have multiple behaviours at the same time. Abstract classes are slightly faster than interfaces. It can be used for time-critical applications. In cases where there are common behaviours across the inheritance hierarchy, these can be coded at one place in abstract classes. Interfaces and abstract classes can also be used together to define a function in interface and functionality in abstract class."
"17. What is a Chain of Responsibility pattern? In what scenarios to apply this pattern? Chain of Responsibility belongs to the category of a behavioural design pattern that passes requests via a chain of handlers. Whenever a request is received, the handler decides whether to process the request or pass it to the next handler of the chain. It is used for achieving loose coupling where the client request is passed through an object chain to process them. Design Patterns Interview Questions The above image represents the UML diagram of this pattern. There are 3 components of this design, they are: Client: This is the point of request origination and the component that accesses the handler for handling the request. Handler: Handler can either be a class or an interface that received the request primarily and dispatches it to the chain of handlers. This Handler knows only the first handler of the chain. Concrete Handlers: These are the actual request handlers in sequential order. This pattern can be used in the following cases: Whenever we want to decouple the sender and the receiver of the request. Whenever we want multiple objects to handle a request at runtime. Whenever we do not want to explicitly specify handlers in the code. Whenever we want to issue a request to several objects without explicitly specifying handlers."
"18. What is Decorator Design Pattern? Design Patterns Interview Questions Decorator design pattern belongs to the category of structural pattern that lets users add new features to an existing object without modifying the structure. This pattern creates a class called decorator class that acts as a wrapper to the existing class by keeping the signatures of class methods intact. This pattern makes use of abstract classes and interfaces with composition for implementing the wrapper. They are mostly used to apply SRP (Single Responsibility Principle) as we divide functionalities into classes with unique concerns. This pattern is structurally similar to the chain of responsibility pattern. Following are the steps to implement decorator design pattern: Create an interface and concrete classes that implement this interface. Create an abstract decorator class that implements the above interface. Create a concrete decorator class that extends the above abstract class. Use the concrete decorator class to decorate the interface objects and verify the output. Let us understand this with the help of an example. Here, we will be creating a Shape Interface and concrete classes- Rectangle and Triangle that implement this Shape interface. We will be creating an abstract decorator class “ShapeDecorator” that implements the Shape interface. We will create RedColorDecorator that extends ShapeDecorator. We will be then using this decorator to implement the functionalities. Design Patterns Interview Questions Creating “Shape” Interface // Shape.java public interface Shape { void draw(); } Create concrete classes Rectangle.java and Triangle.java that implement Shape Interface. // Rectangle.java public class Rectangle implements Shape { // Overriding the draw method @Override public void draw() { System.out.println(""Rectangle Drawn...""); } } Design Patterns Interview Questions // Triangle.java public class Triangle implements Shape { // Overriding the draw method @Override public void draw() { System.out.println(""Triangle Drawn...""); } } Create ShapeDecorator abstract class that implements the Shape interface. // ShapeDecorator.java public abstract class ShapeDecorator implements Shape { protected Shape shapeDecorated; public ShapeDecorator(Shape shapeDecorated) { this.shapeDecorated = shapeDecorated; } public void draw() { shapeDecorated.draw(); } } Create the RedColorDecorator.java class that extends the ShapeDecorator class. public class RedColorDecorator extends ShapeDecorator { public RedColorDecorator(Shape shapeDecorated) { super(shapeDecorated); } @Override public void draw() { shapeDecorated.draw(); setRedBorder(shapeDecorated); } private void setRedBorder(Shape shapeDecorated) { System.out.println(""Red color border added...""); } } Implement the Driver class to demo the decorator class.

"19. What is a Command pattern? The command pattern is a type of behavioural design pattern that transforms a request into a stand-alone object containing all the details about the request. This pattern is a data-driven pattern because we make use of the information about the request by wrapping it as an object and is passed to the invoker object as a command. The invoker object checks for the object that can handle the command and passes it to that object to execute the command. The following diagram is the UML diagram that represents the command design pattern. Design Patterns Interview Questions We have a client that calls the invoker to run a command. We have a Command interface that acts as an abstraction to the underlying concrete classes. Let us understand this with the help of an example of remote control that has only one button. Using this button, we will be controlling the behaviour of two objects tubelight and a radio. The command to control the objects will be implemented using the command design pattern. Create Command interface: // Command Interface interface Command { public void execute(); } Create Tubelight class and its command classes that extend the above interface to control the tubelight. Design Patterns Interview Questions // Tubelight class class TubeLight { public void lightOn(){ System.out.println(""TubeLight on...""); } public void lightOff(){ System.out.println(""TubeLight off...""); } } // Command class to turn on the tubelight class TubeLightOnCommand implements Command { TubeLight tubeLight; // The constructor is passed the light it // is going to control. public TubeLightOnCommand(TubeLight tubeLight){ this.tubeLight = tubeLight; } public void execute(){ tubeLight.lightOn(); } } // Command class to turn off the tubelight class TubeLightOffCommand implements Command { TubeLight tubeLight; public TubeLightOffCommand(TubeLight tubeLight) { this.tubeLight = tubeLight; } public void execute() { tubeLight.lightOff(); } } Create a Radio class and its command classes that extend the above interface to control the radio. Design Patterns Interview Questions // Radio class class Radio { public void radioOn() { System.out.println(""Radio on ...""); } public void radioOff() { System.out.println(""Radio off...""); } public void setVolume(int volumeLevel) { // code to set the volume System.out.println(""Radio volume set to "" + volumeLevel); } } // Command class to turn on the radio class RadioOnCommand implements Command { Radio radio; public RadioOnCommand(Radio radio) { this.radio = radio; } public void execute() { radio.radioOn(); } } // Command class to set the volume of the radio class RadioVolumeCommand implements Command { Radio radio; int volumeLevel; public RadioVolumeCommand(Radio radio, int volumeLevel) { this.radio = radio; this.volumeLevel=volumeLevel; } public void execute() { radio.setVolume(volumeLevel); } } Design Patterns Interview Questions Create a remote control class that has only one button and on click of the button, execute the command functionality: // remote control with one button class RemoteControl{ Command button; // only one button public RemoteControl(){} public void setCommand(Command command){ // set the command the remote will // execute button = command; } public void pressButton(){ // execute the command on click (call) of the button button.execute(); } } Create a Driver class to implement the pattern. Here we will be first turning on the tubelight on the first click of the button, on next click, we will be turning on the radio, then we will be setting the volume of the radio to 4 and then we will be turning oﬀ the tubelight. Design Patterns Interview Questions // Driver class public class Driver { public static void main(String[] args) { RemoteControl remote = new RemoteControl(); TubeLight tubeLight = new TubeLight(); Radio radio = new Radio(); // Turn on Tubelight remote.setCommand(new TubeLightOnCommand(tubeLight)); remote.pressButton(); //Turn on Radio remote.setCommand(new RadioOnCommand(radio)); remote.pressButton(); //Turn off Radio remote.setCommand(new RadioVolumeCommand(radio,4)); remote.pressButton(); // Turn off Tubelight remote.setCommand(new TubeLightOffCommand(tubeLight)); remote.pressButton(); } } Validate the result of this pattern to see if it’s working fine. The result of this code would be: TubeLight on... Radio on ... Radio volume set to 4 TubeLight off..."
"20. What is an Observer Design Pattern? An observer design pattern is a type of behavioural design pattern that is used for defining the one to many dependencies between the objects. It is most useful when we want to get notified about any change in the state of an object. In this pattern, when the state of one object changes, all the dependent objects are notified automatically. The object whose state is monitored is called the Subject whereas the dependents are called the Observers. In Java, we can implement this pattern by making use of the java.util.Observable class and the java.util.Observer interface. The following UML diagram represents the observer design pattern clearly: Design Patterns Interview Questions This design pattern has 3 main components: Subject - This can be an interface or an abstract class that defines operations for attaching (registerObserver()) and detaching the observers (removeObserver()) to the subject. Concrete Subject - This is a concrete class of the Subject. This maintains the object state and whenever any change occurs in that state, the observers are notified about it using notifyObservers() method. Observer - This is an interface or an abstract class that defines the operations for notifying this object (update()). One real work example of this pattern is Facebook or Twitter. Whenever a person updates the status, all the followers would get a notification about his update. An observer can get the notification of the subject as long as it is subscribed or keeping track of it."
"21. What problem does Builder Pattern try to solve? Design Patterns Interview Questions A builder pattern is a type of creational design pattern that lets to construct complex objects in a step by step manner. The pattern lets to produce diﬀerent representations of an object using the same construction logic. It helps in creating immutable classes having a large set of attributes. In the Factory and Abstract Factory Design Patterns, we encounter the following issues if the object contains a lot of attributes: When the arguments are too many, the program will be error-prone while passing from the client to the Factory Class in a specific order. It becomes tedious to maintain the order of arguments when the types are the same. There might be some optional attributes of the object and yet we would be forced to send all parameters and optional attributes as Null. When the object creation becomes complex due to heavy attributes, the complexity of this class would become confusing. The above problems can also be solved by using constructors of required parameters alone. But this causes an issue when there would be new parameters that are added as part of new requirements. This would result in inconsistency. That’s where Builder comes into the picture. This pattern solves the issue of a large number of optional attributes and the inconsistent state by providing means to build an object in a step- by-step way and return the final object utilizing another method. Builder pattern can be implemented by following the below steps: Design Patterns Interview Questions Create a static nested class, copy all arguments from the outer class. This nested class would be called the Builder class. Proper naming convention has to be followed while naming this builder class. For example, if the name of the class is Interviewbit, then the name of the builder would be InterviewbitBuilder. The builder class should have a public constructor with all required attributes sent as parameters. The builder class should have methods for setting optional parameters and return the same builder object post setting these values. The last step is to have a build() method inside the builder class that returns the Object needed by the client. This would require a private constructor in the class that takes the Builder class as the parameter. Following is the sample example of the builder pattern implementation. We have a User class and we will be building UserBuilder class to build the objects of the User class. Design Patterns Interview Questions class User { //All final attributes private final String firstName; // required private final String lastName; // required private final int age; // required private final String phoneNbr; // optional private final String address; // optional private final String nationality; //optional private User(UserBuilder builder) { this.firstName = builder.firstName; this.lastName = builder.lastName; this.age = builder.age; this.phoneNbr = builder.phoneNbr; this.address = builder.address; this.nationality = builder.nationality; } //Setters are not provided to make it immutable public String getFirstName() { return firstName; } public String getLastName() { return lastName; } public int getAge() { return age; } public String getPhoneNbr() { return phoneNbr; } public String getAddress() { return address; } public String getNationality() { return nationality; } @Override public String toString() { return ""User: ""+this.firstName+"" ""+this.lastName+"", ""+this.age+"", ""+this.nationa } public static class UserBuilder { private final String firstName; private final String lastName; private int age; private String phoneNbr; private String address; private String nationality; public UserBuilder(String firstName, String lastName) { this.firstName = firstName; this.lastName = lastName; } bliild(i){ Design Patterns Interview Questions The output of the above code would be: User: Harry Potter, 30, null, 1234567, 221B Baker Street - London User: Ron Weasley, 32, null, 5655, null User: Hermoine Granger, 20, English, null, null"
"22. Consider a scenario where you are writing classes for providing market data and we have the flexibility to switch to diﬀerent vendors or we can be directed to the Direct Exchange Feed. How will you approach this problem to design the system? We can do this by having an interface called “MarketData” which will consist of the methods required by the Client. The MarketData should have the MarketDataProvider as the dependency by employing Dependency Injection. This ensures that even if the provider changes, the market data will not be impacted. The implementation of this problem is le"
"23. What do you understand by the Null Object pattern? In this pattern, a null object is used for replacing the check of validating if the object instance is null or not. This Null Object has a “do nothing” relationship and these can be used for providing default behaviour if the data is unavailable."
"24. What is the MVC design pattern? MVC stands for Model-View-Controller. This pattern is used for separating the application’s concerns as listed below: Model - This represents the object (Java POJO) that carries the data. It can also consist of the logic of updating the controller in case the data changes. View - This represents the data visualization of the model. Controller - This is an interface between the Model and the View by controlling the flow of data into the model and updating the view whenever the model gets updated. This ensures that the model and the views are kept separate. Design Patterns Interview Questions The above image represents how the request flow happens in the MVC Pattern. First, the Browser (client) sends request for a page to the controller of the server. The controller invokes the model, retrieves the data and sends the response. The response is then sent to the view for rendering. The view will be rendered and it is sent back to the client for display."
"25. What are the components of the Composite Entity pattern? This pattern is used in EJB (Enterprise Java Beans) persistence mechanism. A composite entity represents the object graph and is an EJB entity. Whenever a composite entity is updated, the object beans that are internally dependent on this bean are updated automatically. There are 4 main components of the Composite Entity Pattern: Composite Entity - Primary entity bean that can have a coarse-grained object that is meant for persistence. Coarse-Grained Object - This contains the dependent objects which have their life cycle and in turn manages the lifecycle of dependent objects. Dependent Object - This object is dependent on the coarse-grained object throughout the persistence lifecycle. Strategies - These represent how to implement the composite entity."
"26. What is the main advantage of using a prototype design pattern over object creation using a new keyword? Design Patterns Interview Questions Prototype design pattern is used for creating duplicate objects based on the prototype of the already existing object using cloning. Doing this has a positive impact on the performance of object creation. Creating objects using the new keyword requires a lot of resources and is a heavyweight process that impacts performance. Hence, the prototype design pattern is more advantageous than the object created using a new keyword."
"27. How can you achieve thread-safe singleton patterns in Java? A thread-safe singleton class is created which helps in object initialization in the presence of multiple threads. It can be done using multiple ways: Using Enums: Enums are the simplest means of creating a thread-safe singleton class in Java because the synchronization support is inherently done by Java itself. Enums are by default final and this also helps in preventing multiple initializations at the time of serialization. public enum ThreadSafeSingleton{ SINGLETON_INSTANCE; public void display(){ System.out.println(""Thread-safe singleton Display""); } } // The Singleton class methods can be invoked as below ThreadSafeSingleton.SINGLETON_INSTANCE.show(); Using Static Field Initialization: Thread-safe singleton can also be created by creating the instance at the time of class loading. This is achieved by making use of static fields as the Classloader guarantees that the instances are initialized during class loading and the instance is not visible until that has been fully created. Design Patterns Interview Questions public class ThreadSafeSingleton{ private static final ThreadSafeSingleton INSTANCE = new ThreadSafeSingleton(); private ThreadSafeSingleton(){ } public static ThreadSafeSingleton getInstance(){ return INSTANCE; } public void display(){ System.out.println(""Thread-safe Singleon""); } } ThreadSafeSingleton.getInstance().display(); But the disadvantage of this way is that the initialization cannot be done lazily and the getInstance() method is called even before any client can call. Using synchronized keyword: We can make use of the synchronized keyword upon the getInstance method as shown below. In this method, we can achieve lazy initialization, and also since we use synchronized keywords, the object initialization is thread-safe. The only problem is that since the whole method is synchronized, the performance is impacted in the presence of multiple threads. public class ThreadSafeSingleton { // Creating private instance to make it accessible only by getInstance() method private static ThreadSafeSingleton instance; private ThreadSafeSingleton() { // Making constructor private so that objects cant be initialized outside the cla } //synchronized getInstance method synchronized public static ThreadSafeSingleton getInstance(){ if (this.instance == null) { // if instance is null, initialize this.instance = new ThreadSafeSingleton(); } return this.instance; } } Design Patterns Interview Questions Double-check locking: Here, we will be using a synchronized block of code within the getInstance method instead of making the whole method synchronized. This ensures that only a handful of threads have to wait only for the first time thereby not impacting the performance."
"28. What would happen if we do not have a synchronized method for returning Singleton instance in a multi-threaded environment? In a multi-threaded environment, if we have a non-synchronized method for returning instances, there are chances that the method can create more than one instance. Consider that we have 2 threads and both enter the condition for checking if the instance already exists. Both threads will find that the instance has not been created and hence both will create the class instances. This goes against the principle of the Singleton pattern. Hence, in a multi-threaded environment, it is recommended to use synchronized checks. Pattern Programming public class ThreadSafeSingleton { // Creating private instance to make it accessible only by getInstance() method private static ThreadSafeSingleton instance; private ThreadSafeSingleton(){ // Making constructor private so that objects cant be initialized outside the cla } public static ThreadSafeSingleton getInstance(){ if (instance == null){ //synchronized block of code synchronized (ThreadSafeSingleton.class){ if(instance==null) { // initialize only if instance is null instance = new ThreadSafeSingleton(); } } } return instance; } } Design Patterns Interview Questions"

"1. Let us consider the following schema: Table: Person Column Name Type id int email varchar SQL Query Interview Questions Here, id is the primary key column for this table. Email represents the email id of the person. For the sake of simplicity, we assume that the emails will not contain uppercase letters. Write an SQL query to report all the duplicate emails. You can return the result table in any order. Example: Input: Person table: id email 1 a@gmail.com 2 c@yahoo.com 3 a@gmail.com Output: Email a@gmail.com SQL Query Interview Questions Explanation: a@gmail.com is repeated two times. Approach 1: We can first have all the distinct email ids and their respective counts in our result set. For this, we can use the GROUP BY operator to group the tuples by their email id. We will use the COUNT operator to have the total number of a particular email id in the given table. The query for obtaining this resultant set can be written as: select email, count(email) as email_count from Person group by email; Now, we query in the above resultant query set to find out all the tuples which have an email id count greater than 1. This can be achieved using the following query: select email from ( select email, count(email) as email_count from Person group by email ) where email_count > 1; Approach 2: The HAVING clause, which is significantly simpler and more eﬀicient, is a more popular technique to add a condition to a GROUP BY. So, we can first group the tuples by the email ids and then have a condition to check if their count is greater than 1, only then do we include it in our result set. So we may change the solution above to this one. select email from Person group by email having count(email) > 1; SQL Query Interview Questions Approach 3: We can use the concept of joins to solve this problem. We will self-join the Person table with the condition that their email ids should be the same and their ids should be diﬀerent. Having done this, we just need to count the number of tuples in our resultant set with distinct email ids. For this, we use the DISTINCT operator. This can be achieved using the following query: SELECT DISTINCT p1.email FROM Person p1, Person p2 WHERE p1.email = p2.email and p1.id != p2.id;"
"2. Let us consider the following schema: Table: Activity Column Name Type playerId int deviceId int eventDate date gamesplayed int SQL Query Interview Questions This table's primary key is (playerId, eventDate). The activities of numerous game participants are depicted in this table. Each row indicates a person that logged in and played a particular number of games (perhaps 0) before moving on to another device at a later date. Construct a SQL query to provide each player's first login date. You can return the result table in any order. Example 1: Input: Activity table: SQL Query Interview Questions PlayerId deviceId eventDate gamesPlayed 1 22021-08- 099 1 22021-04- 073 2 32021-06- 251 3 12021-03- 021 3 42021-07- 033 Output: playerId firstLogin 1 2021-04-07 2 2021-06-25 3 2021-07-03 Explanation: SQL Query Interview Questions The player with playerId 1 has two login event dates in the example above. However, because the first login event date is 2021-04-07, we display it. Similarly, the first login event date for the player with playerId 2 is 2021-06-25, and the first login event date for the player with playerId 3 is 2021-07-03. Approach 1: We can first group the tuples by their player_id. Now, we want the most initial date when the player logged in to the game. For this, we can use the MIN operator and find the initial date on which the player logged in. The query can be written as follows: select playerId, min(eventDate) as firstLogin from Activity group by playerId Approach 2: We can partition the tuples by the player_id and order them by their event_id such that all the tuples having the same player_id are grouped together. We then number every tuple in each of the groups starting with the number 1. Now, we just have to display the event_date for the tuple having row number 1. For this, we use the ROW_NUMBER operator. The SQL query for it can be written as follows: Approach 3: We follow a similar kind of approach as used in Approach 2. But instead of using the ROW_NUMBER operator, we can use the FIRST_VALUE operator to find the first event_date. The SQL query for it can be written as follows: select distinct(playerId), FIRST_VALUE(eventDate) OVER(PARTITION BY playerId ORDER BY eventDate) as firstLogin from Activity; SELECT playerId, eventDate AS firstLogin FROM ( SELECT playerId, eventDate, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY playerId ORDER BY event FROM Activity ) AS t WHERE seq = 1 SQL Query Interview Questions"

"4. Given the following schema: Table: Cinema Column Name Type id int movie varchar description varchar rating float SQL Query Interview Questions The primary key for this table is id. Each row includes information about a movie's name, genre, and rating. rating is a float with two decimal digits in the range [0, 10]. Write an SQL query to report the movies with an odd-numbered ID and a description that is not ""boring"". Return the result table ordered by rating in descending order. Example: Input: Cinema table: id movie description rating 1 War thriller 8.9 2 Dhakkad action 2.1 3 Gippi boring 1.2 4 Dangal wrestling 8.6 5 P.K. Sci-Fi 9.1 Output SQL Query Interview Questions id movie description rating 5 P.K. Sci-Fi 9.1 1 War thriller 8.9 Explanation: There are three odd-numbered ID movies: 1, 3, and 5. We don't include the movie with ID = 3 in the answer because it's boring. We put the movie with id 5 at the top since it has the highest rating of 9.1. This question has a bit of ambiguity on purpose. You should ask the interviewer whether we need to check for the description to exactly match “boring” or we need to check if the word “boring” is present in the description. We have provided solutions for both cases. Approach 1 (When the description should not be exactly “boring” but can include “boring” as a substring): In this approach, we use the MOD operator to check whether the id of a movie is odd or not. Now, for all the odd-numbered id movies, we check if its description is not boring. At last, we sort the resultant data according to the descending order of the movie rating. The SQL query for this can be written as follows: select * from cinema where mod(id, 2) = 1 and description != 'boring' order by rating DESC; Approach 2 (When the description should not even contain “boring” as a substring in our resultant answer): SQL Query Interview Questions In this approach, we use the LIKE operator to match the description having “boring” as a substring. We then use the NOT operator to eliminate all those results. For the odd-numbered id, we check it similarly as done in the previous approach. Finally, we order the result set according to the descending order of the movie rating. The SQL query for it can be written as follows: SELECT * FROM Cinema WHERE id % 2 = 1 AND description NOT LIKE '%boring%' ORDER BY rating DESC;"

Consider the following Schema: SELECT COUNT(*), gender FROM Employee WHERE dateOfBirth BETWEEN '01/03/1975 ' AND '31/1 SQL Query Interview Questions Table: Tree Column Name Type id int parent_id int Here, id is the primary key column for this table. id represents the unique identity of a tree node and parent_id represents the unique identity of the parent of the current tree node. The id of a node and the id of its parent node in a tree are both listed in each row of this table. There is always a valid tree in the given structure. Every node in the given tree can be categorized into one of the following types:"
"1. ""Leaf"": When the tree node is a leaf node, we label it as “Leaf”"
"2. ""Root"": When the tree node is a root node, we label it as “Root”"

"1. Because node 1’s parent node is null, and it has child nodes 2 and 3, Node 1 is the root node."
"2. Because node 2 and node 3 have parent node 1 and child nodes 5 and 4 respectively, Node 2 and node 3 are inner nodes."
"3. Because nodes 4 and 5 have parent nodes but no child nodes, nodes 4, and 5 are leaf nodes. Approach 1: In this approach, we subdivide our problem of categorizing the type of each of the nodes in the tree. We first find all the root nodes and add them to our resultant set with the type “root”. Then, we find all the leaf nodes and add them to our resultant set with the type “leaf”. Similarly, we find all the inner nodes and add them to our resultant set with the type “inner”. Now let us look at the query for finding each of the node types. For root nodes: SELECT id, 'Root' AS Type FROM tree WHERE parent_id IS NULL Here, we check if the parent_id of the node is null, then we assign the type of node as ‘Root’ and include it in our result set. For leaf nodes: SQL Query Interview Questions SELECT id, 'Leaf' AS Type FROM tree WHERE id NOT IN (SELECT DISTINCT parent_id FROM tree WHERE parent_id IS NOT NULL) AND parent_id IS NOT NULL Here, we first find all the nodes that have a child node. Next, we check if the current node is present in the set of root nodes. If present, it cannot be a leaf node and we eliminate it from our answer set. We also check that the parent_id of the current node is not null. If both the conditions satisfy then we include it in our answer set. For inner nodes: SELECT id, 'Inner' AS Type FROM tree WHERE id IN (SELECT DISTINCT parent_id FROM tree WHERE parent_id IS NOT NULL) AND parent_id IS NOT NULL Here, we first find all the nodes that have a child node. Next, we check if the current node is present in the set of root nodes. If not present, it cannot be an inner node and we eliminate it from our answer set. We also check that the parent_id of the current node is not null. If both the conditions satisfy then we include it in our answer set. At last, we combine all three resultant sets using the UNION operator. So, the final SQL query is as follows: SQL Query Interview Questions SELECT id, 'Root' AS Type FROM tree WHERE parent_id IS NULL UNION SELECT id, 'Leaf' AS Type FROM tree WHERE id NOT IN (SELECT DISTINCT parent_id FROM tree WHERE parent_id IS NOT NULL) AND parent_id IS NOT NULL UNION SELECT id, 'Inner' AS Type FROM tree WHERE id IN (SELECT DISTINCT parent_id FROM tree WHERE parent_id IS NOT NULL) AND parent_id IS NOT NULL ORDER BY id; Approach 2: SQL Query Interview Questions In this approach, we use the control statement CASE. This simplifies our query a lot from the previous approach. We first check if a node falls into the category of “Root”. If the node does not satisfy the conditions of a root node, it implies that the node will either be a “Leaf” node or an “Inner” node. Next, we check if the node falls into the category of “Inner” node. If it is not an “Inner” node, there is only one option le"
"9. Consider the following schema: SELECT id AS `Id`, CASE WHEN tree.id = (SELECT aliastree.id FROM tree aliastree WHERE aliastree.parent_ THEN 'Root' WHEN tree.id IN (SELECT aliastree.parent_id FROM tree aliastree) THEN 'Inner' ELSE 'Leaf' END AS Type FROM tree ORDER BY `Id`; SQL Query Interview Questions Table: Seat Column Name type id int student varchar The table contains a list of students. Every tuple in the table consists of a seat id along with the name of the student. You can assume that the given table is sorted according to the seat id and that the seat ids are in continuous increments. Now, the class teacher wants to swap the seat id for alternate students in order to give them a last-minute surprise before the examination. You need to write a query that swaps alternate students' seat id and returns the result. If the number of students is odd, you can leave the seat id for the last student as it is. Example: SQL Query Interview Questions id student 1 Ram 2 Shyam 3 Vaibhav 4 Govind 5 Krishna For the same input, the output is: id student 1 Shyam 2 Ram 3 Govind 4 Vaibhav 5 Krishna Approach 1: SQL Query Interview Questions In this approach, first we count the total number of students. Having done so, we consider the case when the seat id is odd but is not equal to the total number of students. In this case, we simply increment the seat id by 1. Next, we consider the case when the seat id is odd but is equal to the total number of students. In this case, the seat id remains the same. At last, we consider the case when the seat id is even. In this case, we decrement the seat id by 1. The SQL query for this approach can be written as follows: SELECT CASE WHEN MOD(id, 2) != 0 AND counts != id THEN id + 1 -- for odd ids WHEN MOD(id, 2) != 0 AND counts = id THEN id -- special case for last seat ELSE id - 1 -- For even ids END as id, student FROM seat, (SELECT COUNT(*) as counts FROM seat) AS seat_count ORDER by id; Approach 2: In this approach, we use the ROW_NUMBER operator. We increment the id for the odd-numbered ids by 1 and decrement the even-numbered ids by 1. We then sort the tuples, according to the id values. Next, we assign the row number as the id for the sorted tuples. The SQL query for this approach can be written as follows: select row_number() over (order by (if(id%2=1,id+1,id-1)) ) as id, student from seat;"
"10. Given the following schema: Table: Employee SQL Query Interview Questions Column Name type id int name varchar salary int departmentId int id is the primary key column for this table. departmentId is a foreign key of the ID from the Department table. Each row of this table indicates the ID, name, and salary of an employee. It also contains the ID of their department. Table: Department Column Name type id int name varchar SQL Query Interview Questions id is the primary key column for this table. Each row of this table indicates the ID of a department and its name. The executives of an organization are interested in seeing who earns the most money in each department. A high earner in a department is someone who earns one of the department's top three unique salaries. Construct a SQL query to identify the high-earning employees in each department. You can return the result table in any order. Example: Input: Employee table: SQL Query Interview Questions id name salary departmentId 1 Ram 85000 1 2 Divya 80000 2 3 Tim 60000 2 4 Kim 90000 1 5 Priya 69000 1 6 Saket 85000 1 7 Will 70000 1 Department table: id name 1 Marketing 2 HR Output: SQL Query Interview Questions Department Employee Salary Marketing Kim 90000 Marketing Ram 85000 Marketing Saket 85000 Marketing Will 70000 HR Divya 80000 HR Tim 60000 Explanation: Kim has the greatest unique income in the Marketing department - Ram and Saket have the second-highest unique salary. Will has the third-highest unique compensation. In the HR department: Divya has the greatest unique income. Tim earns the second-highest salary. Because there are only two employees, there is no third-highest compensation. Approach 1: In this approach, let us first assume that all the employees are from the same department. So let us first figure out how we can find the top 3 high-earner employees. This can be done by the following SQL query: SQL Query Interview Questions select emp1.Name as 'Employee', emp1.Salary from Employee emp1 where 3 > ( select count(distinct emp2.Salary) from Employee emp2 where emp2.Salary > emp1.Salary ); Here, we have created two aliases for the Employee table. For every tuple of the emp1 alias, we compare it with all the distinct salaries to find out how many salaries are less than it. If the number is less than 3, it falls into our answer set. Next, we need to join the Employee table with the Department table in order to obtain the high-earner employees department-wise. For this, we run the following SQL command: SELECT d.Name AS 'Department', e1.Name AS 'Employee', e1.Salary FROM Employee e1 JOIN Department d ON e1.DepartmentId = d.Id WHERE 3 > (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT e2.Salary) FROM Employee e2 WHERE e2.Salary > e1.Salary AND e1.DepartmentId = e2.DepartmentId ); Here, we join the Employee table and the Department table based on the department ids in both tables. Also, while finding out the high-earner employees for a specific department, we compare the department ids of the employees as well to ensure that they belong to the same department. Approach 2: SQL Query Interview Questions In this approach, we use the concept of the DENSE_RANK function in SQL. We use the DENSE_RANK function and not the RANK function since we do not want the ranking number to be skipped. The SQL query using this approach can be written as follows: SELECT Final.Department, Final.Employee, Final.Salary FROM (SELECT D.name AS Department, E.name AS Employee, E.salary AS Salary, DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY D.name ORDER BY E.salary DESC) Rank FROM Employee E, Department D WHERE E.departmentId = D.id) Final WHERE Final.Rank < 4; Here, we first run a subquery where we partition the tuples by their department and rank them according to the decreasing order of the salaries of the employees. Next, we select those tuples from this set, whose rank is less than 4."

3. What are the diﬀerent approaches used to solve NLP problems? There are multiple approaches to solving NLP problems. These usually come in 3 categories: Heuristics Machine learning Deep Learning
"4. How do Conversational Agents work? The following NLP components are used in Conversational Agents: NLP Interview Questions Speech Recognition and Synthesis: In the first stage, speech recognition helps convert speech signals to their phonemes, and are then transcribed as words. Natural Language Understanding (NLU): Here, the transcribed text from stage one is further analysed through AI techniques within the natural language understanding system. Certain NLP tasks such as Named Entity Recognition, Text Classification, Language modelling, etc. come into play here. Dialog Management: Once the needed information from text is extracted, we move on to the stage of understanding the user’s intent. The user’s response can then be classified by using a text classification system as a pre-defined intent. This helps the conversational agent in figuring out what is actually being asked. Generating Response: Based on the above stages, the agent generates an appropriate response that is based on a semantic interpretation of the user’s intent."

"9. What do you mean by Stemming in NLP? When we remove the suﬀixes from a word so that the word is reduced to its base form, this process is called stemming. When the word is reduced to its base form, all the diﬀerent variants of that word can be represented by the same form (e.g., “bird” and “birds” are both reduced to “bird”). We can do this by using a fixed set of rules. For instance: if a word ends in “-es,” we can remove the “-es”). NLP Interview Questions Even though these rules might not really make sense as a linguistically correct base form, stemming is usually carried out to match user queries in search engines to relevant documents. And in text classification, is done to reduce the feature space to train our machine learning (ML) models. The code snippet given below depicts the way to use a well known NLP algorithm for stemming called Porter Stemmer using NLTK: from nltk.stem.porter import PorterStemmer stemmer = PorterStemmer() word1, word2 = ""bikes"", ""revolution"" print(stemmer.stem(word1), stemmer.stem(word2)) This gives “bike” as the stemmed version for “bikes,” but “revolut” as the stemmed form of “revolution,” even though the latter is not linguistically correct. Even if this might not aﬀect the performance of the search engine, a derivation of the correct linguistic form becomes useful in some other cases. This can be done by another process that is closer to stemming, known as lemmatization."
"10. What do you mean by Lemmatization in NLP? The method of mapping all the various forms of a word to its base word (also called “lemma”) is known as Lemmatization. Although this may appear close to the definition of stemming, these are actually diﬀerent. For instance, the word “better,” a"
"11. What is the meaning of Text Normalization in NLP? Consider a situation in which we’re operating with a set of social media posts to find information events. Social media textual content may be very exceptional from the language we’d see in, say, newspapers. A phrase may be spelt in multiple ways, such as in shortened forms, (for instance, with and without hyphens), names are usually in lowercase, and so on. When we're developing NLP tools to work with such kinds of data, it’s beneficial to attain a canonical representation of textual content that captures these kinds of variations into one representation. This is referred to as text normalization. Converting all text to lowercase or uppercase, converting digits to text (e.g., 7 to seven), expanding abbreviations, and so on are some frequent text normalisation stages."

"16. Explain how parsing is done in NLP. Parsing is the process of identifying and understanding a text's syntactic structure. It is accomplished by examining the text's constituent pieces. The machine parses each word one by one, then two by two, three by three, and so on. It's a unigram when the system parses the text one word at a time. A bigram is a text that is parsed two words at a time. When the machine parses three words at a time, the set of words is called a trigram. The following points will help us comprehend the importance of parsing in NLP: Any syntax errors are reported by the parser. It aids in the recovery of o"
"17. What do you mean by a Bag of Words (BOW)? NLP Interview Questions The Bag of Words model is a popular one that uses word frequency or occurrences to train a classifier. This methodology generates a matrix of occurrences for documents or phrases, regardless of their grammatical structure or word order. A bag-of-words is a text representation that describes the frequency with which words appear in a document. It entails two steps: A list of terms that are well-known. A metric for determining the existence of well-known terms. Because any information about the sequence or structure of words in the document is deleted, it is referred to as a ""bag"" of words. The model simply cares about whether or not recognised terms appear in the document, not where they appear."
"18. What do you mean by Parts of Speech (POS) tagging in NLP? A Part-Of-Speech Tagger (POS Tagger) reads the text in a language and assigns parts of speech to each word (and other tokens), such as noun, verb, adjective, and so on. To label terms in text bodies, PoS taggers employ an algorithm. With tags like ""noun- plural"" or even more complicated labels, these taggers create more complex categories than those stated as basic PoS."
"19. What is Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) in NLP? Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI), also known as Latent Semantic Analysis, is a mathematical method for improving the accuracy of information retrieval. It aids in the discovery of hidden(latent) relationships between words (semantics) by generating a set of various concepts associated with the terms of a phrase in order to increase information comprehension. Singular value decomposition is the NLP technique utilised for this aim. It's best for working with small groups of static documents."
"20. What is the diﬀerence between NLP and NLU? NLP Interview Questions Natural Language Processing (NLP) Natural Language Understanding NLP is a system that manages end- to-end conversations between computers and people at the same time.NLU aids in the solving of Artificial Intelligence's complex problems. Humans and machines are both involved in NLP.NLU allows machines to interpret unstructured inputs by transforming them into structured text. NLP focuses on interpreting language in its most literal sense, such as what was said.NLU, on the other hand, concentrat extracting context and meaning, or was meant. NLP can parse text-based on grammar, structure, typography, and point of view.It'll be NLU that helps the machine deduce the meaning behind the language content."
"21. What are some metrics on which NLP models are evaluated? The following are some metrics on which NLP models are evaluated: NLP Interview Questions Accuracy: When the output variable is categorical or discrete, accuracy is used. It is the percentage of correct predictions made by the model compared to the total number of predictions made. Precision: Indicates how precise or exact the model's predictions are, i.e., how many positive (the class we care about) examples can the model correctly identify given all of them? Recall: Precision and recall are complementary. It measures how eﬀectively the model can recall the positive class, i.e., how many of the positive predictions it generates are correct. F1 score: This metric combines precision and recall into a single metric that also represents the trade-oﬀ between accuracy and recall, i.e., completeness and exactness. (2 Precision Recall) / (Precision + Recall) is the formula for F1. AUC: As the prediction threshold is changed, the AUC captures the number of correct positive predictions versus the number of incorrect positive predictions."
"22. Explain the pipeline for Information extraction (IE) in NLP. In comparison to text classification, the typical pipeline for IE necessitates more fine- grained NLP processing. For example, we'd need to know the part-of-speech tags of words to identify named entities (people, organisations, etc.). We would require coreference resolution to connect various references to the same entity (e.g., Albert Einstein, Einstein, the scientist, he, etc.). It's worth noting that none of these stages are required for creating a text classification system. As a result, IE is a more NLP- intensive operation than text categorization. Not all steps in the pipeline are required for all IE jobs, as shown in the diagram, and the figure shows which IE tasks necessitate which degrees of analysis. NLP Interview Questions Other than named entity recognition, all other IE tasks require deeper NLP pre- processing followed by models developed for those specific tasks. Key phrase extraction is the task that requires the least amount of NLP processing (some algorithms also do POS tagging before extracting key phrases), whereas all other IE tasks require deeper NLP pre-processing followed by models developed for those specific tasks. Standard evaluation sets are o"

It is a type of unsupervised learning since labels aren’t needed for the process. This is mainly used to learn the mapping function from the input. In order to make the mapping useful, the input is reconstructed from the vector representation. A"
"24. What do you mean by Masked language modelling? Masked language modelling is an NLP technique for extracting the output from a contaminated input. Learners can use this approach to master deep representations in downstream tasks. Using this NLP technique, you may predict a word based on the other words in the sentence. The following is the process for Masked language modelling: Our text is tokenized. We start with text tokenization, just as we would with transformers. Make a tensor of labels. We're using a labels tensor to calculate loss against — and optimise towards — a s we train our model. Tokens in input ids are masked. We can mask a random selection of tokens now that we've produced a duplicate of input ids for labels. Make a loss calculation. We use our model to process the input ids and labels tensors and determine the loss between them. NLP Interview Questions"
"25. What is the meaning of Pragmatic Analysis in NLP? Pragmatic Analysis is concerned with outside word knowledge, which refers to information that is not contained in the documents and/or questions. The many parts of the language that require real-world knowledge are derived from a pragmatics analysis that focuses on what was described and reinterpreted by what it truly meant."
"26. What is the meaning of N-gram in NLP? Text N-grams are commonly used in text mining and natural language processing. They're essentially a collection of co-occurring words within a specific frame, and when computing the n-grams, you usually advance one word (although you can move X words forward in more advanced scenarios)."

The number of digits can be counted as follows: In the image above, we have shown the way of extracting the digits of a number. However, in our questions, we just need to count the digits in the number. So, we have to count the number of times we can divide our input number by 10 before it becomes 0. Let us write the code based on the above algorithm. Java Programming Interview Questions Java Program to Count the Number of Digits in a Number.

What if the number was already 0? It still has 1 digit. So, we have handled that separately. Also, to avoid any confusion, the negative numbers are converted to positive in our function and then we calculate their number of digits. Time Complexity: O(log10N) where N is the input number. This is because we keep dividing the number by 10. Auxiliary Space: O(1) as we have not used any extra space."

This is the follow-up question to the previous question. In the previous question, we discussed how you can check the value of a digit using the modulus (%) operator. So, we will just use the previous code and in every iteration, we will check whether the digit is “D” or not. If it is D, increment the counter. The program for the same is shown below: Java Code for Calculating Frequency of a Digit D in a Number N Java Programming Interview Questions import java.util.*; class Main { public static int countDigitFreq(int n,int D) { if(n == 0 && D == 0) return 1; //number 0 has 1 frequency of 0 //if a negative number is entered if(n < 0) n = -n; int counter = 0; while(n != 0) { int digit = n % 10; //calculate the digit if(digit == D) counter++; n = n/10; } return counter; } public static void main(String args[]) { // Your code goes here Scanner scn = new Scanner(System.in); int n = scn.nextInt(); //input the number int d = scn.nextInt(); //input the digit int x = countDigitFreq(n,d); System.out.println(""The digit "" + d + "" occurs "" + x + "" times in "" + n); } } Sample Input/Output Input: 142454 Output: The digit 4 occurs 3 times in 142454 Java Programming Interview Questions Corner Cases You Might Miss: If the input number is 0 and the digit is also 0, it becomes a crucial corner case. This is because the number 0 has 1 frequency of digit 0 but it will not be handled correctly by our loop. So, we do this separately. Also, we have converted the negative numbers to positive ones to solve this problem. Time Complexity: O(log10N) where N is the input number. This is because we keep dividing the number by 10. Auxiliary Space: We have not used any auxiliary Space here. So, it is O(1)."
"4. Write a Java Program to calculate xn (x to the power n) using Recursion. You can use O(N) time but can’t use any extra space apart from the Recursion Call Stack Space. In a recursive function, we need to find a relation between the smaller problem and the larger problem. Here, we have a clear mathematical relationship between the large problem xn and the problem that is smaller than it i.e. x to the power (n-1). The relation is: {""detectHand"":false} The relation is: (x to the power n) = x * x to the power(n-1) In terms of programming (using functions), we can write this relation as: power(x,n) = x * power(x,n-1) For example, 2 to the power 5 = 32. This can be calculated as 2 * (2 to the power 4) = 2 * 16 = 32. So, we have found the recurrence relation in the above equation. Now, what will be the base case? The base case will be the smallest such problem that we can solve. So, the smallest problem is calculating the power of 0 to any number. We know that any number to the power 0 gives the result as 1. So, this will be our base case. Now, let us write the code for the same. Java Code to Calculate x to the power n Java Programming Interview Questions import java.util.*; class Main { public static double power(double x, int n) { if(n == 0) return 1.0; double xpnm1 = power(x,n-1); //x power n-1 (xpnm1) return x * xpnm1; } public static double pow(double x, int n) { if(n < 0) { return 1.0 / power(x,-n); } return power(x,n); } public static void main(String args[]) { // Your code goes here Scanner scn = new Scanner(System.in); double x = scn.nextDouble(); int n = scn.nextInt(); System.out.println(pow(x,n)); } } Sample Output: For positive Power Input: 1.10 3 Output: 1.3676310000000003 For negative Power Java Programming Interview Questions Input: 1.110 -3 Output: 0.7311913813009502 Corner Cases You Might Miss: The power of a number can be negative too. So, we know that (x to the power -n) = [1/(x to the power n)]. In this way, we can handle the corner test case of a power being negative. What if the number is negative? Is our code handling that case? Yes, it does. Why? Try to think about this. Time Complexity: The time complexity of this code is O(N) where N is the power. We see that the time complexity does not depend on X i.e. the number. It only depends on the power of the number. Auxiliary Space: The auxiliary space is O(1) as we have not used any extra space."
"5. Write a program in Java to calculate pow(x,n) using recursion. The expected time complexity is O(log2N) where N is the power. You cannot use any extra space apart from the recursion call stack space. We have seen how we can calculate the pow(x,n) in linear time. We can optimize our approach by changing the recurrence relation. Let us understand this with the help of an example shown below: Java Programming Interview Questions So, we can see that if the power is even, we can divide the power by 2 and can multiply x to the power n/2 by itself to get our answer. What if the power of the number is odd? Java Programming Interview Questions In that case, we multiply the number x once to the term x to the power n/2 multiplied by itself. Here, n/2 will be the floor value of (n/2). You can verify this for any pair of x and n. So, doing this will reduce the time complexity from O(N) to O(log2N). This happens because of the change in recurrence relation and the recursion tree as shown below. Solving these recurrence relations gives us the respective time complexities. So, the code for O(log2N) approach is shown below Java Code for (x to the power N) in Logarithmic Time Complexity Java Programming Interview Questions import java.util.*; class Main { public static double power(double x, int n) { if(n == 0) return 1.0; double xpnby2 = power(x,n/2); //xpnby2 = x power n by 2 if(n % 2 == 0) return xpnby2 * xpnby2; //if power is even return x * xpnby2 * xpnby2; //if power is odd } public static double pow(double x, int n) { if(n < 0) { return 1.0 / power(x,-n); } return power(x,n); } public static void main(String args[]) { // Your code goes here Scanner scn = new Scanner(System.in); double x = scn.nextDouble(); int n = scn.nextInt(); System.out.println(pow(x,n)); } } Sample Output: For positive Power Input: 1.10 3 Output: 1.3676310000000003 For negative Power Java Programming Interview Questions Input: 1.110 -3 Output: 0.7311913813009502 Corner Cases, You Might Miss: The power of a number can be negative too. So, we know that x-n = (1/xn). In this way, we can handle the corner test case of a power being negative. Time Complexity: As already discussed, Time Complexity is O(log2N). Auxiliary Space: The auxiliary space is O(1) as we have not used any extra space."
"6. Write a program in Java to Toggle the case of every character of a string. For instance, if the input string is “ApPLe”, the output should be “aPplE”. We know that in Java, we cannot make changes to the same string as it is immutable. So, we have to return a new String. The lowercase ASCII characters diﬀer from the uppercase ASCII characters by 32. This means ‘a’ - 32 = ‘A’. So, we will use this concept to Toggle the String cases. Java Code to Toggle Cases Java Programming Interview Questions import java.util.*; class Main { public static void main(String args[]) { // Your code goes here Scanner scn = new Scanner(System.in); String str = scn.nextLine(); StringBuilder res = new StringBuilder(""""); for(int i=0;i<str.length();i++) { char ch = str.charAt(i); //current character if(ch >='A' && ch <= 'Z') { res.append((char)(ch + 32)); } else if(ch >='a' && ch<='z'){ res.append((char)(ch - 32)); } else { res.append(ch); } } String ans = res.toString(); System.out.println(""The string after toggling becomes: "" + ans); } } Sample Output: Input: Ab#$Cd Output: aB#$cD Java Programming Interview Questions Corner Cases, You Might Miss: The String can contain other characters apart from the alphabet.

However, it is not right to say that if it is not a vowel then it will be a consonant as it can also be any other character. So, we have to make sure that it is an alphabet and then make sure that it is not a vowel. The same is done in the code.

The 2 variables (that are) firstIndex and lastIndex will be initialized to -1. The third will be a boolean type variable found which will be initially false. If the element is found, we will make it true, and store the current index in firstIndex and lastIndex variables. If the element is found further, only the lastIndex variable will change.

"20. You are given 2 strings as input. You have to check whether they are anagrams or not. Anagrams are those strings that have the same characters occurring an equal number of times in both the strings. However, the order can be diﬀerent. For example “anagram” and “nagrama” are Anagrams. We will use HashMap to store the frequency of each character of the first string. Then, we will traverse the second string and keep on decrementing the frequency in the HashMap. If for any character in the second string, either the character is not present in the HashMap or its frequency is already 0, we will return false.

The answer is NO as they don’t have an equal number of characters so, they can never be anagrams. So, a separate check for the length of the strings will be beneficial. Time Complexity: O(N + M) where N and M are the lengths of the two strings. This is because we have traversed both the strings separately.

You can print any other order but the shape of the graph of elements of the array should look like a wave. The graph should always start with the peak and not a valley. You are not allowed to use any extra space and you have to solve this problem in O(N) time complexity. One basic approach to solve this problem is to sort the array and then swap the adjacent elements. The time complexity for which is O(NLog2N). Since we have to solve the problem in O(N) time complexity, we can solve it using the Wave Sort algorithm. Our aim is to generate the Wave Graph. The aim can be accomplished by aiming at generating the peaks in the array or aiming at generating the valleys in the array. So, let us try to generate peaks in the array. Since we want the first array to be the peak, we will leave it as it is and start from the index = 2. Here, since we want to generate a peak, we need to have the previous and next elements smaller than our current elements. So, we will check that if our previous element is larger than our element, we will swap them. Again, at the same position, we will also check that the next element should be smaller than our current element. If it is not, swap these 2 elements. This is shown below. Java Programming Interview Questions So, we have to take a jump of 2 indices every time till we reach the end of the array. Hence, we will be able to wave sort the array in O(N) time and O(1) space.

We can clearly see that the first diagonal has row = col i.e. the gap between them is 0. In the next diagonal, the column index is always greater than the row index by 1. The max gap up to which we can go is N-1, where N is the number of columns. So, we will use this gap strategy to traverse the matrix diagonally as shown below. Java Programming Interview Questions Java Code for Diagonal Traversal Java Programming Interview Questions import java.util.*; public class Main { public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception { // write your code here Scanner scn = new Scanner(System.in); int n = scn.nextInt(); int[][] mat = new int[n][n]; for(int i=0;i<n;i++) { for(int j=0;j<n;j++) { mat[i][j] = scn.nextInt(); } } diagonalTraversal(mat); } public static void diagonalTraversal(int[][] mat) { int maxGap = mat[0].length - 1; for(int gap=0;gap<=maxGap;gap++) { for(int i=0,j=gap;i<mat.length && j<mat[0].length;i++,j++) { System.out.print(mat[i][j] + "" ""); } System.out.println(); } } } Sample Output Java Programming Interview Questions Input: 5 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 Output: 1 7 13 19 25 2 8 14 20 3 9 15 4 10 5 Time Complexity: O(N2) as we have to traverse half matrix of size N x N. Auxiliary Space: O(1) is the auxiliary space."
"24. Write a program in Java to search an element in a row-wise and column-wise sorted 2-D matrix of size M x N. You have to search the element in O(N + M) time complexity without using any extra space. Print “true” if the element exists in the matrix else print “false”. The normal searching technique will take O(N2) time complexity as we will search every element in the matrix and see if it matches our target or not. The other approach uses the fact that the elements are sorted row-wise. We can apply binary search on every row. Hence, the time complexity will be O(Nlog2N) Since we want the solution in O(N + M), this approach is not the one we will use. We will use the Staircase Search Algorithm. See, we know that the elements are sorted column-wise and row-wise. So, we start from the last element of the first row as shown below Java Programming Interview Questions Let us say we want to search for 21. We know that 21 is larger than 15. Since the matrix is row-wise sorted, element 15 is the largest element of this row. So, we are not going to find 21 in this row. So, we move directly to the last element of the next row. The Same is the case here as well. So, we move to the next row. Here, the element is 22. So, 21 might be present in this row. So, we move one step backwards in this row only. Java Programming Interview Questions On moving one step backwards, we see that we reach 16. Since this number is smaller than our target of 21, we know that we will not find our target in this row. Hence, we move to the last element of the next row and the same happens here too. Now, we are in the last row. We know that element might exist in this row. So, we keep on moving back in this row and find element 21. Java Programming Interview Questions So, we will implement this same algorithm. This is called staircase search. Java Code for Staircase Search Sample Output import java.util.*; class Main { public static boolean staircaseSearch(int[][] matrix, int target) { if(matrix == null || matrix.length == 0 || matrix[0].length == 0) return false; int j = matrix[0].length - 1 ; int i = 0; while(i < matrix.length && j>=0) { if(matrix[i][j] == target) return true; else if(matrix[i][j] < target) { i++; } else { j--; } } return false; } public static void main(String args[]) { // Your code goes here Scanner scn = new Scanner(System.in); int N = scn.nextInt(); int M = scn.nextInt(); int[][] mat = new int[N][M]; for(int i=0;i<N;i++) { for(int j=0;j<M;j++) { mat[i][j] = scn.nextInt(); } } int target = scn.nextInt(); System.out.println(staircaseSearch(mat,target)); } } Java Programming Interview Questions 5 5 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 21 Output: true Time Complexity: O(N + M) is the time complexity of staircase search. This is because we will have to search for a maximum of one row and one column. Auxiliary Space: O(1) as we have not used any extra space."
"25. Write a program in Java to create a user defined exception and also show it working means when it throws an exception. Here, you have to explain and write a user-defined exception of your own. This code is just for reference purposes. So, we are going to create an exception called LowBalanceException for a bank. So, whenever a person comes to the bank to create a bank account, the minimum account balance should be 5000. So, if the balance is less than 5000, the exception will be thrown. Let us write the code for the same. Java Code for User-Defined Exception Java Programming Interview Questions public class Main { public static void main(String[] args) { Account a1 = new Account(500); Account a2 = new Account(); a2.setBalance(500); Account a3 = new Account(10000); System.out.println(""a1 balance = "" + a1.getBalance() + "" a2 balance = "" + a2.getBa } } class Account { private int balance; Account() { balance = 5000; } Account(int balance) { try { if(balance>=5000) { this.balance = balance; System.out.println(""The account is created and the balance is set to: ""+ balance); } else { this.balance=0; System.out.println(""Account can not be created""); throw new LowBalanceException(); } } catch(LowBalanceException e) { System.out.println(e); } } void setBalance(int balance) { try { if(balance>=5000) { this.balance = balance; System.out.println(""The account is created and the balance is set to: ""+ ba } else { this.balance=0; System.out.println(""Account can not be created""); throw new LowBalanceException(); } } catch(LowBalanceException e) { System.out.println(e); } } int getBalance() { return balance; } } class LowBalanceException extends Exception { bliii(){ Java Programming Interview Questions Output The account can not be created Low Balance: The balance cannot be less than Rs.5000/- The account can not be created Low Balance: The balance cannot be less than Rs.5000/- The account is created and the balance is set to 10000 a1 balance = 0 a2 balance = 0 a3 balance =10000"
"26. Write a program in Java to show multiple inheritance. Multiple inheritance is not possible in Java. So, we can use Interfaces in Java to create a scenario of multiple inheritance. In our example below, we have a class called Phone and a class called SmartPhone. We know that a SmartPhone is a Phone, however, it has various other features as well. For instance, a SmartPhone has a camera, a music player, etc. Notice that a SmartPhone is a Phone and has a camera and has a Music Player. So, there is one is-A relationship and multiple has-A relationships. The is-A relationship denotes extending the features and the has-A relationship denotes implementing the features. This means that a SmartPhone is a Phone i.e. it extends the features of a Phone however, it just implements the features of a Music Player and a Camera. It itself is not a music player or a camera. Following is the code for the above discussion. Java Code for Multiple Inheritance Java Programming Interview Questions public class Main { public static void main(String[] args) { SmartPhone sp1 = new SmartPhone(); Phone p1 = new SmartPhone(); ICamera c1 = new SmartPhone(); IMusicplayer m1 = new SmartPhone(); sp1.videocall(); p1.call(); p1.message(); c1.click(); c1.record(); m1.play(); m1.pause(); m1.stop(); } } class Phone { void call() { System.out.println(""call""); } void message() { System.out.println(""Message""); } } interface ICamera { void click(); void record(); } interface IMusicplayer { void play(); void pause(); void stop(); } class SmartPhone extends Phone implements ICamera, IMusicplayer { void videocall() { System.out.println(""Video call""); } @Override public void click() { System.out.println(""Picture click""); } Java Programming Interview Questions Output Video call Call Message Picture click Record Video Play music Pause Music Stop music"
"27. Write a program in Java, to show nesting of classes. Nesting of classes means writing a class inside another class. The inner classes in Java are usually static. This happens when we don’t want to use the variable of the outer class in the inner class. This helps to create an instance/object of the inner class without creating an instance of the Outer class. Following is a program to show the nesting of classes in Java. Java Code Java Programming Interview Questions public class Main { public static void main(String[] args) { Outer obj1 = new Outer(10, 20); Outer.Inner2 obj2 = new Outer.Inner2(40); obj2.showData(); Outer.Inner3.z = 100; System.out.println(Outer.Inner3.z); } } class Outer { private int x, y; Outer() { System.out.println(""Outer class default constructor called""); } Outer(int x, int y) { this.x = x; this.y = y; } void showData() { System.out.println(""the value of x is:"" + x + "" and the value of y is: "" + y); } class Inner1 { int z = 0; Inner1() { System.out.println(""Inner class default constructor called""); } Inner1(int z) { this.z = z; } void showData() { System.out.println(""The value of x is: "" + x + "" the value of y is: "" + y + "" a } } static class Inner2 { int z = 0; Inner2() { System.out.println(""Inner class default constructor called""); } Inner2(int z) { hi Java Programming Interview Questions Output The value of z is: 40 100"
"28. Write a program in Java to show the Diamond Problem. The Diamond Problem is a problem of Multiple inheritance. It is one of the major reasons why multiple inheritance is not supported in Java. Have a look at the diagram given below. Here, class D extends from classes B and C and they extend from Class A. Let us say that class A has a function called print(). This function is overridden in Class B and C respectively. Now, when class D extends B and C both, say it calls super.print(). Which function should be called? This is an anomaly called the diamond problem or deadly diamond of death. Java Code for Diamond Problem Java Programming Interview Questions class A { public void print() { System.out.println(""Class A print method""); } } class B extends A { @Override public void print() { System.out.println(""Class B print method""); } } class C extends A { @Override public void print() { System.out.println(""Class C print method""); } } //multiple inheritance not allowed in Java class D extends A,B { @Override public void print() { System.out.println(""Class D print method""); } } class Main { public static void main(String args[]) { // Your code goes here D obj = new D(); obj.print(); } } Output This compilation error occurs because multiple inheritance is not allowed in Java."
"29. Write a program in Java to show isAlive() and join() operations in multithreading. Java Programming Interview Questions The isAlive() method tells whether a thread is alive or terminated. These alive and terminated are the states of a thread in Java. Also, the join() operation joins a thread to another. This means that the thread will wait for the complete execution of the thread to which it is joined even if its own work is completed. Then, they both will terminate together. Java Code to show isAlive() and join() operations Java Programming Interview Questions class DemoThread extends Thread { public DemoThread(String name) { super(name); setPriority(MAX_PRIORITY); } } class DemoThread2 extends Thread { public void run() { int count = 1; while (true) { System.out.println(count); count++; try { Thread.sleep(100); } catch (InterruptedException e) { System.out.println(e); } } } } public class Main { public static void main(String[] args) { DemoThread t = new DemoThread(""Thread 1""); System.out.println(""ID "" + t.getId()); System.out.println(""NAME "" + t.getName()); System.out.println(""PRIORITY "" + t.getPriority()); t.start(); System.out.println(""STATE "" + t.getState()); System.out.println(""ALIVE "" + t.isAlive()); DemoThread2 t2 = new DemoThread2(); try { Thread.sleep(100); } catch (Exception e) { } t2.setDaemon(true); t2.start(); // t2.interrupt(); Thread mainThread = Thread.currentThread(); try { mainThread.join(); // Now main will not terminate till the daemon thread is te } catch (Exception e) { } } } Java Programming Interview Questions Output ID 13 NAME Thread 1 PRIORITY 10 STATE RUNNABLE ALIVE false 1 2 3 4 5 6 7"
"Web Designer Interview Questions In simple terms, web design refers to the process of creating the visual layout and look of a website so that they resonate with a company's brand, convey information, and support user-friendliness. Designing a website comprises many components that work together to create the overall user experience including graphic design, UX/UI design, SEO (Search Engine Optimization), and content creation. Whether you're building a website, mobile application, or maintaining content on a website, appearance and design are crucial elements. Since the mid-2010s, web design has increasingly been geared towards designing for mobile devices and tablet browsers."
"2. Who is a web designer? Simply put, a web designer is responsible for the appearance of a website. A web designer will take your ideas and create a mockup so that you can visualize the final look and feel of your website. Designers tend to possess expertise in UI (user interface), which means they create a site that is intuitive and easy to use. Designing a website is largely a creative process that involves organizing content and images across several web pages, integrating applications, and including other interactive elements. Some of their responsibilities include: Design and layout websites according to client specifications. Prepare mockups and samples for clients to review. Selecting readable fonts. Picking colors that are both attractive and easy-to-read. Using colors, fonts, and layouts to implement a brand's identity. Create a map of the website's structure to ensure a seamless navigation experience. Integrating images, texts, logos, videos, and other elements. Designing optimized versions of websites and pages for desktops and mobile devices."
"3. What are the most widely used languages for web design? Web Designer Interview Questions The following are some common languages used in web design. Among the following, the most fundamental language for web design is HTML, which will provide you with a solid foundation for designing websites and web applications. In fact, it is probably the first language taught to a web designer, thereby making it an essential tool for all designers to have. HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) Java JavaScript SQL (Structured Query Language) PHP (Hypertext Processor) Python"
"4. Explain responsive web design. The responsive web design process involves creating a web page that ""responds"" to or resizes itself to fit whatever screen size the viewer is using. This involves the use of HTML and CSS to resize, shrink, hide, and enlarge a website so that it appears correctly on all device resolutions (desktops, laptops, tablets, and phones). With responsive design, you can have one website that adapts to diﬀerent screens and devices according to their sizes."
5. How do you set an image as the background of a web page? Background images provide a visually appealing and interactive background to a website. These images can be applied in many ways.
"1. In the body tag, pass the URL or location path of a background image in the background attribute. Syntax <body background = ""Image URL or path"" > Website Body </body> Example Web Designer Interview Questions <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <title>Scaler Academy</title> </head> <body background=""scaler.png""> <h1>Welcome to Scaler Family</h1> <p><a href=""https://www.scaler.com"">Scaler.com</a></p> </body> </html>"
"2. Add CSS style properties. Syntax <style> body { background-image:url("" URL of the image ""); } </style> Example <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <style> body { background-image: url(""scaler1.jpg""); } </style> </head> <body> <h1>Scaler Academy</h1> </body> </html>"
"6. Which color would you choose as a web designer when declaring the ""delete"" button? Web Designer Interview Questions By using a color like Red, you can make the ""Delete"" button more visible, especially if two buttons have to be displayed simultaneously. Almost always, red is used as a symbol of caution, so that is a great way to get the user's attention."
"7. What do you mean by grid system? In graphic design, grid systems provide a two-dimensional framework for aligning and laying out elements. This is a set of measurements that the designer can use to size and align objects within a certain format. It is composed of horizontal and vertical lines that intersect, allowing the contents to be arranged on the page. A grid can facilitate the positioning of multiple design elements on a website in a way that is visually appealing, facilitates a user's flow, and improves accessibility and the attractiveness of information and visuals. A grid can also be broken down into several subtypes, each with its own specific application in web design."
"8. What should you consider when writing an error message? Although the error message may seem innocuous, it has a big impact on the user's experience. Error messages written poorly can frustrate users, while well-written error messages increase users' subjective satisfaction and speed. One should consider the following factors when writing an error message: Write in clear, simple language, without ambiguity, so that the issue can be understood easily. Keep it concise, precise, and meaningful. Be humble and don't blame users as tone and language are major factors in how they interpret your message. Refrain from using words that are negative. Provide a solution to resolve the error. Format your error messages correctly. Don't overwhelm users with error messages."
"9. What are the most common problems in website design? A few of the most common website design problems include: Web Designer Interview Questions An outdated or inadequate web design. Poor website navigation. Ineﬀective SEO strategies. Convoluted or unclear user journeys. Excessive use of images, icons, colors, and textures. Lack of quality content. Poor quality images. Hidden contact details. Upload time is extremely slow. Mobile optimization is not available."
"10. Explain information architecture. Information architecture (IA) refers to the process of planning, organizing, structuring, and labeling content in a comprehensive, logical, and sustainable manner. It serves as a means of structuring and classifying content in a way that is clear and understandable, so users can find what they are looking for with little eﬀort. IA may also be used to redesign an existing product, rather than being limited to new products. Essentially, it determines how users will access your website information as well as how well their user experience will be."
"11. What is W3C and how does it aﬀect web design? An international organization, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) promotes web development. Members of the organization, a full-time staﬀ, experts invited from around the world, and the public collaborate together to create Web Standards. Also, W3C develops standards for the World Wide Web (WWW) to facilitate interoperability and collaboration between all web stakeholders. Since its inception in 1994, W3C has endeavored to lead the web towards a fuller potential."
"12. How does white space aﬀect the content on the webpage? White space, also referred to as empty space or negative space in web design, refers to the unused space that surrounds the content and functional elements of a web page. With white space, you make your design breathe by minimizing the amount of text and functionality users see at once. Web Designer Interview Questions By using white space, you can visually group and separate elements, draw attention to a specific element, and reinforce a content grid or layout in web design and other media. Aside from contributing to the harmony and balance of a design and assisting the branding process, whitespace can also be utilized to direct the reader from one element to the next. This makes the website appear clean and uncluttered, providing readers with the information they will enjoy."
"13. What format would you use to embed self-hosted video on a web site? When you embed a video on a website using HTML5 video (instead of using YouTube or another video-hosting service), the website must ensure that the video is served in a format that the browser can play. The MP4 video format is currently supported by major browsers, operating systems, and devices (using MPEG4 or h.264 compressions). For Firefox clients and some Android devices that are not capable of playing MP4 videos, having copies of the video in OGV and WebM formats is helpful."
"14. Can a web page have multiple H1 tags? Would it matter? H1 tags can be used as many times as you like on a web page, as there is no upper or lower limit. A website's H1 (title) tag is of great importance to search engines and other machines that read the code of a web page and interpret its contents. It is generally recommended that web pages contain only one H1 tag. Multiple H1 tags can, however, be used as long as they are not overused, and are contextually relevant to the structure of the page. H1 is considered the main heading or title of an article, document, or section. It may be detrimental to the website's SEO performance if H1 elements are not used properly."
"15. When should you use HTML5 tags such as STRONG, EM, SMALL? Web Designer Interview Questions While these tags provide a unique visual eﬀect (STRONG makes the text bold, EM italicized it, and SMALL shrinks it), this is not their primary purpose, and they should not be used simply to style a piece of content in a specific way. Unlike some other tags, these ones provide a unique visual eﬀect (STRONG makes the text bold, EM italicized it, and SMALL shrinks it). However, they are not intended to provide a visual eﬀect, nor should they simply be used to style content in a particular way. <em> tag: Used to mark up the emphasized text. <strong> tag: O"

"18. State diﬀerence between HTML elements and HTML tags HTML elements and HTML tags diﬀer in the following ways: Web Designer Interview Questions HTML Tags HTML Elements Tags indicate the start and end of an HTML element, i.e., the container that holds other HTML elements (except <!DOCTYPE>).All HTML elements must be enclosed between the start tag and closing tag. Each tag begins with a '<' and ends with a '>' symbol. The basic structure of an HTML element consists of the start tag (<tagname>), the close tag (</tagname>) and the content inserted between these tags. Any text inside ‘<’ and ‘>’ is called a tag.A HTML element is anything written in between HTML tags. Example: <p> </p> Example: <p>Scaler Academy</p>"
"19. What do you mean by jQuery? jQuery simplifies the process of implementing JavaScript on a website. With jQuery, most common tasks that require a lot of JavaScript code are wrapped into methods that can be invoked with just one line of code. Additionally, jQuery simplifies several complex aspects of JavaScript, such as DOM manipulation and AJAX calls. JQuery is a lightweight JavaScript library that strives to do more with less coding. Following are some features of the jQuery library: Web Designer Interview Questions HTML/DOM manipulation HTML event methods CSS manipulation Eﬀects and animations AJAX Utilities"
20. What are the diﬀerent JQuery functions available for designing web pages? Here are a few popular JQuery functions used in web design: Animated hover eﬀect Simple slide panel Accordion#1 and Accordion#2 Entire block clickable Styling diﬀerent link types Collapsible panels Chainable transition eﬀect Simple disappearing eﬀect Image replacement gallery Simple slide panel
21. What do you mean by “visibility:hidden” and “display:none”. Both visibility and display are significant properties in CSS.
"1. Visibility property In a web document, this property allows a user to specify whether an element is visible or not, while the hidden elements consume space. Syntax: visibility: visible| collapse | hidden | inherit | initial; Web Designer Interview Questions Property Values: visible: It specifies that an element must be visible. This is the default value. hidden: Indicates that the element is not visible, but it does aﬀect the layout. collapse: Hides an element when it appears on a row or cell in a table. initial: The visibility property of the element is set to its default value. inherit: The property has been inherited from its parent."
"2. Display property The Display property specifies how components (such as hyperlinks, divs, headings, etc.) will be displayed on the web page. Syntax: display: none | block | inline | inline-block; Property Values: none: No elements will be displayed. inline: This makes the element render or appear as an inline element. This is the default value. block: This makes the element render or appear as a block-level element. inline-block: The element is rendered as a block box within an inline box."
"22. Describe CSS file and its benefits. CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a style sheet language. Essentially, it controls and oversees how elements should be portrayed on screen, on paper, in speech, or in any other media. CSS allows you to control the text color, font style, spacing between paragraphs, and columns' size and arrangement. This allows you to quickly change the appearance of several web pages at once. Advantages: Web Designer Interview Questions Has lightweight code. Is easy to update and maintain. Provides various formatting options. Increased consistency in design. Easy to present diﬀerent styles to diﬀerent audiences. Greater accessibility. Improved accessibility. Has great SEO benefits. Faster download times because of its simplicity."
"23. How are CSS files integrated into your webpage? There are three ways to add CSS to HTML documents: Inline: Inserting the style attribute inside an HTML element. Example: <h1 style=""color:blue;"">Scaler Academy</h1> <p style=""color:black;"">Welcome to Scaler Family!</p> Internal: Adding <style> element to the <head> section. Example: Web Designer Interview Questions <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <style> body {background-color: powderblue;} h1 { color: blue; font-size: 200% } p { color: red; font-size: 140%; border: 2px solid black; margin: 20px; } </style> </head> <body> <h1>Scaler Academy</h1> <p>Welcome to Scaler Family!</p> </body> </html> External: Linking to an external CSS file using the <link> element. Example: <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""styles.css""> </head> <body> <h1>Scaler Academy</h1> <p>Welcome to Scaler Family!</p> </body> </html>"
"24. Why should a graphic containing several words be saved in GIF and not JPG? Web Designer Interview Questions In cases where an image consists of certain words, it is recommended that the image be saved as a GIF instead of a JPG. JPG files have a file compression feature that causes the fonts to become unreadable."
"25. In what situations would you advise using JPEG and when would you recommend PNG? Diﬀerent image compression formats use diﬀerent compression techniques for diﬀerent purposes. JPEG: The JPEG compression process reduces the size of an image by identifying similar colored areas; the higher the compression level, the more aggressively the process searches for these areas, which can lead to loss of visual information and artifacts at the edges of the compressed region. Colorful photos, illustrations, gradients, and other richly colored images benefit from this compression. It is particularly screenshots, flat icons, simple UI elements, and schematics. PNG: The PNG compression method reduces the number of colors in the image. It may result in a slight loss of color shades depending on the compression level. PNGs are excellent for UI elements, icons, signs, logos, illustrations that contain text, and screenshots. Unlike JPEGs, they also support transparent areas. In general, PNG files are bigger than JPEG files and do not oﬀer good compression for photos and complex, colored images and gradients."
"26. Explain Dreamweaver template. The Dreamweaver templates typically come with premade CSS templates. All the pages and content on your website can be created, modified, and updated instantly with Dreamweaver templates. By making a site more flexible and consistent, it can increase your productivity. Designers can revise the Dreamweaver template files at once to make changes to the site at their convenience. With the help of a good web designer, you can create a Dreamweaver template out of any HTML or PHP page. You can, however, use readymade templates if you want a consistent design across all pages of your website, but do not know how to create DWT. Web Designer Interview Questions"
"27. In order to make one picture higher or lower than the other, how do you align them in HTML? To align images higher or lower than each other, use the align statement as part of the IMG SRC tag Syntax: <img align=""left|right|middle|top|bottom""> Example: < IMG SRC = ""http://www.abc.com/fhndsy.gif"" align=top> < IMG SRC = ""http://www.abc.com/fhndsy.gif"" align=right>"
"28. What is the purpose of CSS float property? The CSS float property can be used to determine how content is positioned and formatted on the page. One of the most common uses of this property is wrapping text around images. A float property can be used to wrap any inline element around a defined HTML element, for example, a paragraph, list, span, div, table, and an iframe. The float property indicates whether an element should float right, le"
"29. What should you do when a client doesn't like your designs? It is possible that you will receive some constructive feedback from clients regarding your designs and may need to adjust them based on updated specifications. Employers typically ask this question to understand how you deal with problems, respond to feedback, and build relationships with clients. Sample Answer: “I encountered this situation while working for a client in the financial sector. The company felt that my design was too sophisticated for many of their customers and might turn away some of their loyal members. I explained to the bank why my web design might be a good fit for the youngest of customers, but ultimately we agreed to a compromise. The final website had a sleek appearance with flashy elements that would appeal to the young audience.”"
"30. What steps do you follow during your design process, and is your client involved much? By asking this question, the interviewer may be trying to ascertain how you work, how well you serve your clients, and how easy it is to work with you. Before answering, take a moment to collect your thoughts so the hiring manager will be able to understand your approach fully. Sample Answer: Web Designer Interview Questions “First, I always meet with my clients to discuss their needs. Next, I dra"
"31. What elements would you include in an optimized site? As a web designer, it is your responsibility to ensure that your website is positioned well for SEO (Search Engine Optimization) and is responsive so that it can be used eﬀectively by users. Using this interview question, a company can ascertain the designer's familiarity with SEO and responsiveness practices. To demonstrate your knowledge of website optimization, discuss elements such as URL structure, keywords, page titles, meta descriptions, alt text, and H1 tags."
"32. What is the best way to combine fonts? How many font types should designers use on one website? In some cases, fonts work together nicely and make a good combination when displayed together. As a general rule, two fonts are compatible if they are either quite similar, but with at least one significant diﬀerence (analogous fonts), or if they are very diﬀerent, but have one notable characteristic in common (complimentary fonts). Web Designer Interview Questions The best way to combine two fonts is to look for their common and unique features (serifs, x-height, historic backgrounds, aperture, thickness, stroke contrast). Fonts that look too similar should not be combined (e.g., Helvetica and Lucida Grande or Arial and Verdana). Avoid combining many font styles at once. Stick to two or three font sizes maximum; it will save you time and avoid readers skipping over the content. Try one serif font and one sans serif font. Especially at contrasting sizes, they tend to work well together. Choosing contrasting fonts is a good idea. Many ways can be used to create contrast, including weight, size, spacing, color, etc. It is best to use a single font family. A superfamily contains many styles, weights, and cases within the same typeface. Sticking to one superfamily allows you to create a minimalist layout and have enough variation for your needs."
"33. When deciding on a color scheme, what factors should you take into consideration? Color schemes are an important part of the design process. Choosing colors for your project isn't easy, but keeping a few things in mind is a good way to ensure that you come up with a great color combination. Web Designer Interview Questions Be familiar with the brand identity and what the company does. Get to know what they do, what services or products they oﬀer, what their principles are, and so on. Knowing this will help you determine the right color scheme for their brand. Get to know the Big Boss better. Simply take a look at what they already use and have been using. See the uniforms, the logos, etc. You should choose a color(s) that reflect the nature of the company and its employees. Choose colors that are appealing to your target audience. When designing, always keep in mind who you're designing for and what the ultimate objective is. You might need to conduct some research on your target audience, or test diﬀerent color combinations. The client/company's emotional relationship with their target market needs to be reflected. Brighter colors are appropriate for brands with high energy, whereas muted colors are appropriate for mature brands. Pick colors that are associated with positivism to make a lasting impression on the audience. Learn the significance of color in the specific industry."

"2. What are the 5 V’s in Big Data? Big Data Interview Questions Volume: A considerable amount of data stored in data warehouses reflects the volume. The data may reach random heights; these large volumes of data need to be examined and processed. Which may exist up to or more than terabytes and petabytes. Velocity: Velocity basically introduces the pace at which data is being produced in real-time. To give a simple example for recognition, imagine the rate at which Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter posts are generated per second, an hour or more. Variety: Big Data comprises structured, unstructured, and semi-structured data collected from varied sources. This diﬀerent variety of data requires very diﬀerent and specific analyzing and processing techniques with unique and appropriate algorithms. Veracity: Data veracity basically relates to how reliable the data is, or in a fundamental way, we can define it as the quality of the data analyzed. Value: Raw data is of no use or meaning but once converted into something valuable. We can extract helpful information."
"3. Why businesses are using Big Data for competitive advantage. Irrespective of the division and scope of the firm, data is now an essential tool for businesses to utilise. Companies are frequently using big data to gain a competing edge over business rivals. Checking the datasets a company collects is just one part of the big data process. Big data professionals also need to know what the company requires from the application and how they plan to use the data to their advantage. Big Data Interview Questions Confident decision-building: Analytics aims to develop decision building, and big data endures to sustain this. Big data can help enterprises speed up their decision-making method with so much data available while still being assured of their choice. Nowadays, moving fast and reacting to broader trends and operational changes is a huge business benefit in a quick-paced society. Asset optimisation: Big data signifies that businesses can control assets at a personal level. This implies they can adequately optimise assets depending on the data source, improve productivity, extend the lifespan of help, and reduce the downtime some assets may require. This gives a competing advantage by assuring the company is getting the most out of its assets and links with decreasing costs. Cost reduction: Big data can support businesses to reduce their outgoings. From analysing energy usage to assessing the eﬀectiveness of staﬀ operating patterns, data collected by companies can help them recognise where they can make cost savings without having a negative impact on company operations. Improve customer engagement: When surveying online, consumers make confident choices indicating their decisions, habits, and tendencies that can then be used to develop and tailor consumer dialogue, which could then be interpreted into increased sales. Understanding what each client is looking for through the data collected on them means you can target them with specific products, but it also gives a personal feel that many consumers today have come to await. Identify new revenue streams: Analytics can further assist companies in identifying new revenue streams and expanding into other areas. For example, knowing customer trends and decisions allow firms to decide the way they should go. The data companies accumulate can also likely be sold, adding income streams and the potential to build alliances with other businesses."
"4. How is Hadoop and Big Data related? Big Data Interview Questions If we talk about Big Data, we do talk about Hadoop as well. So, this is one of the most critical questions from an interview perspective. That you might surely face. Hadoop is an open-source framework for saving, processing, and interpreting complex, disorganized data sets for obtaining insights and knowledge. So, that is how Hadoop and Big Data are related to each other."
"5. Explain the importance of Hadoop technology in Big data analytics. Since big data includes a large volume of data, i.e., structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data, analyzing and processing this data is quite a big task. There was a need for a tool or technology to help process the data at a rapid speed. Therefore, Hadoop is used because of its capabilities like storage, processing capability. Moreover, Hadoop is an open-source so"
"6. Explain the core components of Hadoop. Big Data Interview Questions Hadoop is an open-source framework intending to store and process big data in a distributed manner. Hadoop’s Essential Components: HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) – Hadoop’s key storage system is HDFS. The extensive data is stored on HDFS. It is mainly devised for storing massive datasets in commodity hardware. Hadoop MapReduce – The responsible layer of Hadoop for data processing is MapReduce. It puts a request for processing of structured and unstructured data which is already stored in HDFS. It is liable for the parallel processing of a high volume of data by distributing data into detached tasks. There are two stages of processing: Map and Reduce. In simple terms, Map is a stage where data blocks are read and made available to the executors (computers /nodes /containers) for processing. Reduce is a stage where all processed data is collected and collated. YARN – The framework which is used to process in Hadoop is YARN. For resource management and to provide multiple data processing engines like real-time streaming, data science, and batch processing is done by YARN."
"7. Explain the features of Hadoop. Hadoop assists in not only store data but also processing big data. It is the most reliable way to handle significant data hurdles. Some salient features of Hadoop are – Big Data Interview Questions Distributed Processing – Hadoop helps in distributed processing of data, i.e., quicker processing. In Hadoop HDFS, the data is collected in a distributed manner, and the data is parallel processing, and MapReduce is liable for the same. Open Source – Hadoop is independent of cost as it is an open-source framework. Changes are allowed in the source code as per the user’s requirements. Fault Tolerance – Hadoop is highly fault-tolerant. By default, for every block, it creates three replicas at distinct nodes. This number of replicas can be modified according to the requirement. So, we can retrieve the data from a diﬀerent node if one of the nodes fails. The discovery of node failure and restoration of data is made automatically. Scalability – It is fitted with diﬀerent hardware, and we can promptly access the new device. Reliability – The data in Hadoop is stored on the cluster in a safe manner that is autonomous of the machine. So, the data stored in the Hadoop ecosystem’s data does not get aﬀected by any machine breakdowns."
"8. How is HDFS diﬀerent from traditional NFS? NFS (Network File system): A protocol that enables customers to access files over the network. NFS clients would allow files to be accessed as if the files live on the local device, even though they live on the disk of a networked device. HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System): A distributed file system is shared between multiple networked machines or nodes. HDFS is fault-tolerant because it saves various copies of files on the file system; the default replication level is 3. The notable diﬀerence between the two is Replication/Fault Tolerance. HDFS was intended to withstand failures. NFS does not possess any fault tolerance built-in. Benefits of HDFS over NFS: Apart from fault tolerance, HDFS helps to create multiple replicas of files. This reduces the traditional bottleneck of many clients accessing a single file. In addition, since files have multiple images on various physical disks, reading performance scales better than NFS.

"9. What is data modelling and what is the need for it. Data Modeling as a business has been practiced in the IT sector for many decades. As an idea, the data model is a means to arrive at the diagram by examining the data in question and getting a deep knowledge. The method of representing the data visually encourages the business and the technology specialists to understand the data and understand how it will get used. Kinds Of Data Models The three principal types of data models are conceptual, logical, and physical. Think of them as an improvement from an abstract layout to a detailed mapping of the database setup and final form: Conceptual Data Model: Conceptual data models are the most simplistic and abstract. Minor annotation happens in this model, but the overall layout and controls of the data relationships are set. You’ll find elements like basic market rules that need to be applied, the levels or entity classes of data that you plan to cover, and any other regulations that may limit layout options. Data models are usually used in the development stage of a project. Logical Data Model: The logical data model extends on the basic framework laid out in the conceptual model, but it counts more relational factors. Thus, some basic annotations are related to overall properties or data attributes, but not many annotations concentrate on actual data units. Hence, this model is beneficial in data warehousing projects. Physical Data Model: The physical data model is the most comprehensive and the last step before database production, it usually accounts for database management system- specific properties and rules. Advantages Of Data Modeling: Big Data Interview Questions Data modeling oﬀers several diﬀerent benefits to companies as part of their data management: Before you even build a database, you’ve cleaned, organized, and modeled your data to project what your next step should look like. Data modeling advances data quality and makes databases limited, prone to mistakes and bad design. Data modeling produces a visual flow of data and how you plan to organize it. This supports employees know what’s happening with data and how they relate to the data management puzzle. It also develops data-related communication across departments in an organization. Data modeling allows more profound database design, bringing forth more useful applications and data-based business insights down the line."
"10. How to deploy a Big Data Model? Mention the key steps involved. Deploying a model into a Big Data Platform involves mainly three key steps they are, Data ingestion Data Storage Data Processing Let’s have a look at what these are, Big Data Interview Questions Data Ingestion: This process involves collecting data from diﬀerent sources like social media platforms, business applications, log files, etc. Data Storage: When data extraction is completed, the challenge is to store this large volume of data in the database in which the Hadoop Distributed File system (HDFS) plays a vital role. Data Processing: A"
"11. What is fsck? The term fsck stands for File System Check, used by HDFS. It is used to check discrepancies and if there is any diﬀiculty in the file. For instance, if there are any missing blocks in the file, HDFS gets reported through this command."
"12. What are the three modes that Hadoop can run? Big Data Interview Questions Local Mode or Standalone Mode: By default, Hadoop is configured to operate in a no distributed mode. It runs as a single Java process. Instead of HDFS, this mode utilizes the local file system. This mode is more helpful for debugging, and there isn't any requirement to configure core-site.xml, hdfs-site.xml, mapred-site.xml, masters & slaves. Standalone mode is ordinarily the quickest mode in Hadoop. Pseudo-distributed Mode: In this mode, each daemon runs on a separate java process. This mode requires custom configuration ( core-site.xml, hdfs-site.xml, mapred-site.xml). The HDFS is used for input and output. This mode of deployment is beneficial for testing and debugging purposes. Fully Distributed Mode: It is the production mode of Hadoop. One machine in the cluster is assigned as NameNode and another as Resource Manager exclusively. These are masters. Rest nodes act as Data Node and Node Manager. These are the slaves. Configuration parameters and environment need to be defined for Hadoop Daemons. This mode gives fully distributed computing capacity, security, fault endurance, and scalability."
13. Mention the common input formats in Hadoop. The common input formats in Hadoop are - Text Input Format: This is the default input format in Hadoop. Key-Value Input Format: Used to read Plain Text Files in Hadoop. Sequence File Input format: This is used to read Files in a sequence in Hadoop.
14. What are the diﬀerent Output formats in Hadoop? The diﬀerent Output formats in Hadoop are - Big Data Interview Questions Textoutputformat: TextOutputFormat is the default output format in Hadoop. Mapfileoutputformat: Mapfileoutputformat is used to write the output as map files in Hadoop. DBoutputformat: DBoutputformat is just used for writing output in relational databases and Hbase. Sequencefileoutputformat: Sequencefileoutputformat is used for writing sequence files. SequencefileAsBinaryoutputformat: SequencefileAsBinaryoutputformat is used to write keys to a sequence file in binary format. Big Data Interview Questions for Experienced
"15. What are the diﬀerent big data processing techniques? Big Data processing methods analyze big data sets at a massive scale. Oﬀline batch data processing is typically full power and full scale, tackling arbitrary BI scenarios. In contrast, real-time stream processing is conducted on the most recent slice of data for data profiling to pick outliers, impostor transaction exposures, safety monitoring, etc. However, the most challenging task is to do fast or real-time ad-hoc analytics on a big comprehensive data set. It substantially means you need to scan tons of data within seconds. This is only probable when data is processed with high parallelism. Diﬀerent techniques of Big Data Processing are: Batch Processing of Big Data Big Data Stream Processing Real-Time Big Data Processing Map Reduce"
16. What is Map Reduce in Hadoop? Big Data Interview Questions Hadoop MapReduce is a so
"17. When to use MapReduce with Big Data. MapReduce is a programming model created for distributed computation on big data sets in parallel. A MapReduce model has a map function that performs filtering and sorting and a reduced function, which serves as a summary operation. MapReduce is an important part of the Apache Hadoop open-source ecosystem, and it’s extensively used for querying and selecting data in the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS). A variety of queries may be done depending on the broad spectrum of MapReduce algorithms possible for creating data selections. In addition, MapReduce is fit for iterative computation involving large quantities of data requiring parallel processing. This is because it represents a data flow rather than a procedure. Big Data Interview Questions The more enhanced data we produce and accumulate, the higher the need to process all that data to make it usable. MapReduce’s iterative, parallel processing programming model is a good tool for creating a sense of big data."
18. Mention the core methods of Reducer. The core methods of a Reducer are: setup(): setup is a method called just to configure diﬀerent parameters for the reducer. reduce(): reduce is the primary operation of the reducer. The specific function of this method includes defining the task that has to be worked on for a distinct set of values that share a key. cleanup(): cleanup is used to clean or delete any temporary files or data a
"19. Explain the distributed Cache in the MapReduce framework. Big Data Interview Questions Distributed Cache is a significant feature provided by the MapReduce Framework, practiced when you want to share the files across all nodes in a Hadoop cluster. These files can be jar files or simple properties files. Hadoop's MapReduce framework allows the facility to cache small to moderate read-only files such as text files, zip files, jar files, etc., and distribute them to all the Datanodes(worker-nodes) MapReduce jobs are running. All Datanode gets a copy of the file(local-copy), which Distributed Cache sends."
"20. Explain overfitting in big data? How to avoid the same. Overfitting is generally a modeling error referring to a model that is tightly fitted to the data, i.e. When a modeling function is closely fitted to a limited data set. Due to Overfitting, the predictivity of such models gets reduced. This eﬀect leads to a decrease in generalization ability failing to generalize when applied outside the sample data. There are several Methods to avoid Overfitting; some of them are: Cross-validation: A cross-validation method refers to dividing the data into multiple small test data sets, which can be used to tune the model. Early stopping: A"

"22. What is the default replication factor in HDFS? By default, the replication factor is 3. There are no two copies that will be on the same data node. Usually, the first two copies will be on the same rack, and the third copy will be oﬀ the shelf. It is advised to set the replication factor to at least three so that one copy is always safe, even if something happens to the rack. We can set the default replication factor of the file system and each file and directory exclusively. We can lower the replication factor for files that are not essential, and critical files should have a high replication factor."
"23. Mention features of Apache sqoop. Big Data Interview Questions Robust: It is extremely robust and easy to use. In addition, it has community support and contribution. Full Load: Loading a table in Sqoop can be done in one command. Multiple tables can also be loaded in the same process. Incremental Load: Incremental load functionality is also supported. Whenever the table is updated, with the help of Sqoop, it can be loaded in parts too. Parallel import/export: Importing and exporting of data is done by the YARN framework. It also provides fault tolerance too. Import results of SQL query: It allows us to import the output from the SQL query into the Hadoop Distributed File System."
24. Write the command used to copy data from the local system onto HDFS? The command used for copying data from the Local system to HDFS is: hadoop fs –copyFromLocal [source][destination]
"25. What is partitioning in Hive? Big Data Interview Questions In general partitioning in Hive is a logical division of tables into related columns such as date, city, and department based on the values of partitioned columns. Then these partitions are subdivided into buckets so that they provide extra structure to the data that may be used for more eﬀicient querying. Now let’s experience data partitioning in Hive with an instance. Consider a table named Table1. The table contains client details like id, name, dept, and year of joining. Assume we need to retrieve the details of all the clients who joined in 2014. Then, the query examines the whole table for the necessary data. But if we partition the client data by the year and save it in a diﬀerent file, this will decrease the query processing time."
"26. Explain Features Selection. During processing, Big data may contain a large amount of data that is not required at a particular time, So we may be required to select only some specific features that we are interested in. The process of extracting only the needed features from the Big data is called Feature selection. Feature selection Methods are - Big Data Interview Questions Filters Method: In this method of variable ranking, we only consider the importance and usefulness of a feature. Wrappers Method: In this method, ‘induction algorithm’ is used, Which can be used to produce a classifier. Embedded Method: This method is a combination of eﬀiciencies of both Filters and wrappers methods."
27. How can you restart NameNode and all the daemons in Hadoop? The following commands will help you restart NameNode and all the daemons: You can stop the NameNode with ./sbin /Hadoop-daemon.sh stop NameNode command and then start the NameNode using ./sbin/Hadoop-daemon.sh start NameNode command.You can stop all the daemons with the ./sbin/stop-all.sh command and then start the daemons using the ./sbin/start-all.sh command.
28. What is the use of the -compress-codec parameter? -compress-codec parameter is generally used to get the output file of a sqoop import in formats other than .gz.
"29. What are missing values in Big data? And how to deal with it? Big Data Interview Questions Missing values in Big Data generally refer to the values which aren’t present in a particular column, in the worst case they may lead to erroneous data and may provide incorrect results. There are several techniques used to deal with the missing values they are - Big Data Interview Questions Mean or Median Imputation: When data is missing at irregular intervals, we can use list-wise or pair-wise deletion of the missing observations. Still, there can be multiple reasons why this may not be the most workable option: There may not be enough notes with non-missing data to produce a reliable analysis In predictive analytics, missing data can prevent the forecasts for those observations which have missing data External factors may require specific observations to be part of the analysis In such cases, we impute values for missing data. A simple technique is to use the mean or median of the non-missing observations. This can be useful in cases where the number of missing observations is low. However, for many missing values, using mean or median can result in loss of variation in data, and it is better to use imputations. Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE): MICE believes that the missing data are Missing at Random (MAR). It imputes data on a variable-by-variable basis by specifying an imputation model per variable. MICE uses predictive mean matching (PMM) for continuous variables, logistic regressions for binary variables, bayesian polytomous regressions for factor variables, and proportional odds model for ordered variables to impute missing data. To set up the data for MICE, it is essential to note that the algorithm uses all the variables in the data for predictions. In this case, variables that may not be useful for predictions, like the ID variable, should be removed before implementing this algorithm. Data$ID <- NULL Secondly, as mentioned above, the algorithm treats diﬀerent variables diﬀerently. So, all categorical variables should be treated as factor variables before implementing MICE. Data$year <- as.factor(Data$year) Data$gender <- as.factor(Data$gender) Then you can implement the algorithm using the MICE library in R library(mice) init = mice(Data, maxit=0) method = init$method Big Data Interview Questions"
"30. What are the things to consider when using distributed cache in Hadoop MapReduce? Heterogeneity: The design of applications should allow the users to access services and run applications over a heterogeneous collection of computers and networks, considering hardware devices, OS, Network, Programming languages. Transparency: Distributed system Designers must hide the complexity of the system as much as they can. Some Terms of transparency are location, access, migration, relocation, and so on. Openness: It is a characteristic that determines whether the system can be extended and reimplemented in various ways. Security: Distributed system Designers must take care of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Scalability: A system is said to be scalable if it can manage the increase of users and resources without undergoing a striking loss of performance."

Big Data Interview Questions The chief configuration parameters that the user of the MapReduce framework needs to mention is: Job’s input Location Job’s Output Location The Input format The Output format The Class including the Map function The Class including the reduce function JAR file, which includes the mapper, the Reducer, and the driver classes."
"32. How can you skip bad records in Hadoop ? Hadoop can provide an option wherein a particular set of lousy input records could be skipped while processing map inputs. SkipBadRecords class in Hadoop oﬀers an optional mode of execution in which the bad records can be detected and neglected in multiple attempts. This may happen due to the presence of some bugs in the map function. The user has to manually fix it, which may sometimes be possible because the bug may be in third-party libraries. With the help of this feature, only a small amount of data is lost, which may be acceptable because we are dealing with a large amount of data."
"33. Explain Outliers. Outliers are the data points that are very far from the group, which is not a part of any group or cluster. This may aﬀect the behavior of the model, they may predict wrong results, or their accuracy will be very low. Therefore Outliers must be handled carefully as they may also contain some helpful information. The presence of these outliers may lead to misleading a Big Data model or a Machine Learning Model. The results of this may be, Poor Results Lower accuracy Longer Training Time Big Data Interview Questions"
"34. What is Distcp? It is a Tool which is used for copying a very large amount of data to and from Hadoop file systems in parallel. It uses MapReduce to aﬀect its distribution, error handling, recovery, and reporting. It expands a list of files and directories into input to map tasks, each of which will copy a partition of the files specified in the source list. Big Data Interview Questions"
"35. Explain Persistent, Ephemeral and Sequential Znodes. Persistent znodes: The default znode in ZooKeeper is the Persistent Znode. It permanently stays in the zookeeper server until any other clients leave it apart. Ephemeral znodes: These are the temporary znodes. It is smashed whenever the creator client logs out of the ZooKeeper server. For example, assume client1 created eznode1. Once client1 logs out of the ZooKeeper server, the eznode1 gets destroyed. Sequential znodes: Sequential znode is assigned a 10-digit number in numerical order at the end of its name. Assume client1 produced a sznode1. In the ZooKeeper server, the sznode1 will be named like this: sznode0000000001. If client1 generates another sequential znode, it will bear the following number in a sequence. So the subsequent sequential znode is <znode name>0000000002."
"36. Explain the Pros and Cons of Big Data? Pros of Big Data are: Big Data Interview Questions Increased productivity: Recently, it was found that 59.9% of businesses use big data tools like Hadoop and Spark to develop their sales. Current big data tools enable analysts to examine instantly, which enhances their productivity. Also, the insights inferred from the analysis of big data can be used by organizations to increase productivity in diﬀerent forms throughout the company. Reduce costs: Big data analytics help businesses reduce their costs. In most companies, big data tools had served them to enhance operational performance and decrease costs, and in few other companies had started using big data to decrease expenses. Interestingly, very few companies selected cost reduction as their primary goal for big data analytics, suggesting that this is merely a very welcome side benefit for many. Improved customer service: Improving customer service has always been one of the primary goals for big data analytics projects, and it has been a success for many companies with the help of this. Various customer contact points like Social media, customer relationship management systems, etc., transfer a lot of information about their customers. And this analysis and data is used to improve the services for the customers Fraud detection: The primary purpose of using Big data analytics is in the financial services industry for detecting frauds. The advantage of big data analytics systems is that it depends on machine learning, because of which they are great at recognizing patterns and irregularities. As a result, these techniques can give banks and credit card companies the capacity to detect stolen credit cards or deceitful purchases, usually before the cardholder knows that something is wrong. More significant innovation: A few companies have started investing in analytics with the sole purpose to bring new things and disturb their markets. The reason behind this is if they can see the future of the market with the help of insights before their competitors, they can come out strong from that situation with a few new goods and services and capture the market quickly. On the other hand, implementing big data analytics is not as easy as we think; there are a few diﬀiculties too when it comes to implementing it. Big Data Interview Questions Cons of Big Data are: Need for talent: The number one big data challenge that we have been facing for the past three years is the skill set required for it. A lot of companies also face diﬀiculty when designing a data lake. Hiring or training staﬀ will only increase the cost considerably, and also, imbibing big data skills takes a lot of time. Cybersecurity risks: Storing, especially sensitive big data will make those businesses a prime target for cyberattackers. Security is one of the top big data challenges, and cybersecurity breaches are the single greatest data threat that enterprises encounter. Hardware needs: Another critical concern for businesses is the IT base necessary to help big data analytics drives. Storage space for storing the data, networking bandwidth for transferring it to and from analytics systems, and calculating resources to achieve those analytics are costly to buy and keep. Data quality: The disadvantage in working with big data was the requirement to address data quality problems. Before companies can use big data for analytics purposes, data scientists and analysts need to ensure that the data they are working with is accurate, appropriate, and in the proper format for analysis. This slows the process, but if companies don't take care of data quality issues, they may find that the insights produced by their analytics are useless or even harmful if performed."
"37. How do you convert unstructured data to structured data? An open-ended question and there are many ways to achieve this. Big Data Interview Questions Programming: Coding/ Programming is the most tried out method to transform unstructured data into a structured form. Programming is advantageous to accomplish because we get independence with it, which you can use to change the structure of the data in any form possible. Several programming languages, such as Python, Java, etc., can be used. Data/Business Tools: Many BI (Business Intelligence) tools support the drag and drop functionality for converting unstructured data into structured data. One cautious thing before using BI tools is that most of these tools are paid, and we have to be financially capable to support these tools. For people who lack both experience and skills needed for option 1, this is the way to go."
"38. What is data preparation? Data preparation is the method of cleansing and modifying raw data before processing and analyzing it. It is a crucial step before processing and usually requires reformatting data, making improvements to data, and consolidating data sets to enrich data. Data preparation is an unending task for data specialists or business users. But, it is essential to convert data into context to get insights and then, can eliminate the biased results found due to poor data quality. For instance, the data construction process typically includes standardizing data formats, enhancing source data, and/or eliminating outliers."

By operator overloading we can modify the default meaning to the operators like +, -, *, /, <=, etc. For example - The following code is for adding two complex number using operator overloading- C++ Interview Questions class complex{ private: float r, i; public: complex(float r, float i){ this->r=r; this->i=i; } complex(){} void displaydata(){ cout<<”real part = “<<r<<endl; cout<<”imaginary part = “<<i<<endl; } complex operator+(complex c){ return complex(r+c.r, i+c.i); } }; int main(){ complex a(2,3); complex b(3,4); complex c=a+b; c.displaydata(); return 0; }"
"6. What is polymorphism in C++? Polymorphism in simple means having many forms. Its behavior is diﬀerent in diﬀerent situations. And this occurs when we have multiple classes that are related to each other by inheritance. For example, think of a base class called a car that has a method called car brand(). Derived classes of cars could be Mercedes, BMW, Audi - And they also have their own implementation of a cars The two types of polymorphism in c++ are: Compile Time Polymorphism Runtime Polymorphism C++ Interview Questions Polymorphism in C++"
7. Explain constructor in C++ The constructor is a member function that is executed automatically whenever an object is created. Constructors have the same name as the class of which they are members so that compiler knows that the member function is a constructor. And no return type is used for constructors. Example: C++ Interview Questions class A{ private: int val; public: A(int x){ //one argument constructor val=x; } A(){ //zero argument constructor } } int main(){ A a(3); return 0; }
"8. Tell me about virtual function Virtual function is a member function in the base class that you redefine in a derived class. A virtual function is declared using the virtual keyword. When the function is made virtual, C++ determines which function is to be invoked at the runtime based on the type of the object pointed by the base class pointer."
"9. Compare compile time polymorphism and Runtime polymorphism The main diﬀerence between compile-time and runtime polymorphism is provided below: C++ Interview Questions Compile-time polymorphism Run time polymorphism In this method, we would come to know at compile time which method will be called. And the call is resolved by the compiler.In this method, we come to know at run time which method will be called. The call is not resolved by the compiler. It provides fast execution because it is known at the compile time.It provides slow execution compared to compile-time polymorphism because it is known at the run time. It is achieved by function overloading and operator overloading.It can be achieved by virtual functions and pointers. Example - int add(int a, int b){ return a+b; } int add(int a, int b, int c){ return a+b+c; } int main(){ cout<<add(2,3)<<endl; cout<<add(2,3,4)<<endl; return 0; } Example - class A{ public: virtual void fun(){ cout<<""base ""; } }; class B: public A{ public: void fun(){ cout<<""derived ""; } }; int main(){ A *a=new B; a->fun(); return 0; } C++ Interview Questions"
"10. What do you know about friend class and friend function? A friend class can access private, protected, and public members of other classes in which it is declared as friends. Like friend class, friend function can also access private, protected, and public members. But, Friend functions are not member functions. For example - class A{ private: int data_a; public: A(int x){ data_a=x; } friend int fun(A, B); } class B{ private: int data_b; public: A(int x){ data_b=x; } friend int fun(A, B); } int fun(A a, B b){ return a.data_a+b.data_b; } int main(){ A a(10); B b(20); cout<<fun(a,b)<<endl; return 0; } Here we can access the private data of class A and class B."
11. What are the C++ access specifiers? In C++ there are the following access specifiers: Public: All data members and member functions are accessible outside the class. C++ Interview Questions Protected: All data members and member functions are accessible inside the class and to the derived class. Private: All data members and member functions are not accessible outside the class.
"12. Define inline function If a function is inline, the compiler places a copy of the code of that function at each point where the function is called at compile time. One of the important advantages of using an inline function is that it eliminates the function calling overhead of a traditional function."
"13. What is a reference in C++? A reference is like a pointer. It is another name of an already existing variable. Once a reference name is initialized with a variable, that variable can be accessed by the variable name or reference name both. For example- int x=10; int &ref=x; //reference variable If we change the value of ref it will be reflected in x. Once a reference variable is initialized it cannot refer to any other variable. We can declare an array of pointers but an array of references is not possible."
14. What do you mean by abstraction in C++? Abstraction is the process of showing the essential details to the user and hiding the details which we don’t want to show to the user or hiding the details which are irrelevant to a particular user.
"15. Is deconstructor overloading possible? If yes then explain and if no then why? C++ Interview Questions No destructor overloading is not possible. Destructors take no arguments, so there’s only one way to destroy an object. That’s the reason destructor overloading is not possible."
"16. What do you mean by call by value and call by reference? In call by value method, we pass a copy of the parameter is passed to the functions. For these copied values a new memory is assigned and changes made to these values do not reflect the variable in the main function. In call by reference method, we pass the address of the variable and the address is used to access the actual argument used in the function call. So changes made in the parameter alter the passing argument."
17. What is an abstract class and when do you use it? A class is called an abstract class whose objects can never be created. Such a class exists as a parent for the derived classes. We can make a class abstract by placing a pure virtual function in the class.
18. What are destructors in C++? A constructor is automatically called when an object is first created. Similarly when an object is destroyed a function called destructor automatically gets called. A destructor has the same name as the constructor (which is the same as the class name) but is preceded by a tilde. Example: C++ Interview Questions class A{ private: int val; public: A(int x){ val=x; } A(){ } ~A(){ //destructor } } int main(){ A a(3); return 0; }
"19. What are the static members and static member functions? When a variable in a class is declared static, space for it is allocated for the lifetime of the program. No matter how many objects of that class have been created, there is only one copy of the static member. So same static member can be accessed by all the objects of that class. A static member function can be called even if no objects of the class exist and the static function are accessed using only the class name and the scope resolution operator ::"
"20. Explain inheritance Inheritance is the process of creating new classes, called derived classes, from existing classes. These existing classes are called base classes. The derived classes inherit all the capabilities of the base class but can add new features and refinements of their own. Example- C++ Interview Questions Inheritance in C++ Class Bus, Class Car, and Class Truck inherit the properties of Class Vehicle. The most important thing about inheritance is that it permits code reusability. C++ Interview Questions For Experienced"
"21. What is a copy constructor? A copy constructor is a member function that initializes an object using another object of the same class. Example- C++ Interview Questions class A{ int x,y; A(int x, int y){ this->x=x; this->y=y; } }; int main(){ A a1(2,3); A a2=a1; //default copy constructor is called return 0; } We can define our copy constructor. If we don’t define a copy constructor then the default copy constructor is called."
22. What is the diﬀerence between shallow copy and deep copy? The diﬀerence between shallow copy and a deep copy is given below: Shallow Copy Deep Copy Shallow copy stores the references of objects to the original memory address.Deep copy makes a new and separate copy of an entire object with its unique memory address. Shallow copy is faster.Deep copy is comparatively slower. Shallow copy reflects changes made to the new/copied object in the original object.Deep copy doesn’t reflect changes made to the new/copied object in the original object C++ Interview Questions
"23. What is the diﬀerence between virtual functions and pure virtual functions? A virtual function is a member function in the base class that you redefine in a derived class. It is declared using the virtual keyword. Example- class base{ public: virtual void fun(){ } }; A pure virtual function is a function that has no implementation and is declared by assigning 0. It has no body. Example- class base{ public: virtual void fun()=0; }; Here, = sign has got nothing to do with the assignment, and value 0 is not assigned to anything. It is used to simply tell the compiler that a function will be pure and it will not have anybody."
"24. If class D is derived from a base class B. When creating an object of type D in what order would the constructors of these classes get called? C++ Interview Questions The derived class has two parts, a base part, and a derived part. When C++ constructs derived objects, it does so in phases. First, the most-base class(at the top of the inheritance tree) is constructed. Then each child class is constructed in order until the most-child class is constructed last. So the first Constructor of class B will be called and then the constructor of class D will be called. During the destruction exactly reverse order is followed. That is destructor starts at the most-derived class and works its way down to base class. So the first destructor of class D will be called and then the destructor of class B will be called."
"25. Can we call a virtual function from a constructor? Yes, we can call a virtual function from a constructor. But the behavior is a little diﬀerent in this case. When a virtual function is called, the virtual call is resolved at runtime. It is always the member function of the current class that gets called. That is the virtual machine doesn’t work within the constructor. For example- C++ Interview Questions class base{ private: int value; public: base(int x){ value=x; } virtual void fun(){ } } class derived{ private: int a; public: derived(int x, int y):base(x){ base *b; b=this; b->fun(); //calls derived::fun() } void fun(){ cout<<”fun inside derived class”<<endl; } }"
26. What are void pointers? A void pointer is a pointer which is having no datatype associated with it. It can hold addresses of any type. For example- void *ptr; char *str; p=str; // no error str=p; // error because of type mismatch We can assign a pointer of any type to a void pointer but the reverse is not true unless you typecast it as str=(char*) ptr; C++ Interview Questions
"27. What is this pointer in C++? The member functions of every object have a pointer named this, which points to the object itself. The value of this is set to the address of the object for which it is called. It can be used to access the data in the object it points to. Example class A{ private: int value; public: void setvalue(int x){ this->value=x; } }; int main(){ A a; a.setvalue(5); return 0; }"
NumPY Interview Questions
"2. Why is NumPy preferred over Matlab, Octave, Idl or Yorick? NumPy is an open-source, high-performing library that allows complex mathematical and scientific computational capabilities. It makes use of Python language which is a high-level, easy-to-learn, general-purpose programming language. It supports the following: Powerful functions for performing complex mathematical operations on multi- dimensional matrices and arrays. The operations on ndarrays of NumPy are approximately up to 50% faster when compared to operations on native lists using loops. This eﬀiciency is very much useful when the arrays have millions of elements. Provides indexing syntax to access portions of data easily in a large array. Provides built-in functions which help to easily perform operations related to linear algebra and statistics. It takes only a few lines of code to achieve complex computations using NumPy."
"3. How are NumPy arrays better than Python’s lists? NumPY Interview Questions Python lists support storing heterogeneous data types whereas NumPy arrays can store datatypes of one nature itself. NumPy provides extra functional capabilities that make operating on its arrays easier which makes NumPy array advantageous in comparison to Python lists as those functions cannot be operated on heterogeneous data. NumPy arrays are treated as objects which results in minimal memory usage. Since Python keeps track of objects by creating or deleting them based on the requirements, NumPy objects are also treated the same way. This results in lesser memory wastage. NumPy arrays support multi-dimensional arrays. NumPy provides various powerful and eﬀicient functions for complex computations on the arrays. NumPy also provides various range of functions for BitWise Operations, String Operations, Linear Algebraic operations, Arithmetic operations etc. These are not provided on Python’s default lists."
"4. What are ndarrays in NumPy? ndarray object is the core of the NumPy package. It consists of n-dimensional arrays storing elements of the same data types and also has many operations that are done in compiled code for optimised performance. These arrays have fixed sizes defined at the time of creation. Following are some of the properties of ndarrays: When the size of ndarrays is changed, it results in a new array and the original array is deleted. The ndarrays are bound to store homogeneous data. They provide functions to perform advanced mathematical operations in an eﬀicient manner."
"5. What are ways of creating 1D, 2D and 3D arrays in NumPy? Consider you have a normal python list. From this, we can create NumPy arrays by making use of the array function as follows: One-Dimensional array NumPY Interview Questions import numpy as np arr = [1,2,3,4] #python list numpy_arr = np.array(arr) #numpy array Two-Dimensional array import numpy as np arr = [[1,2,3,4],[4,5,6,7]] numpy_arr = np.array(arr) Three-Dimensional array import numpy as np arr = [[[1,2,3,4],[4,5,6,7],[7,8,9,10]]] numpy_arr = np.array(arr) Using the np.array() function, we can create NumPy arrays of any dimensions."
6. How do you find the data type of the elements stored in the NumPy arrays? NumPy supports the following datatypes: NumPY Interview Questions i - integer S - string b - boolean f - float u - unsigned integer c - complex float m - timedelta M - datetime O - object U - unicode string V - fixed memory chunk for types such as void We can make use of the dtype property that returns the type of the elements stored in the NumPy array. Let us consider the below code snippet. We create some sample arrays and we see what the data types of these arrays are. The output will be: int64 <U12 |S1
"7. How can you reverse a NumPy array? There are two ways of reversing a NumPy array. Method 1: Using the slicing method: We can make use of [::-1] for reversing the array. The following example demonstrates this: import numpy as np arr1 = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4]) arr2 = np.array(['I', 'love', 'Interviewbit']) # Stored as Unicode characters with l arr3 = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4], dtype='S') # Creating numpy array of defined type print(arr1.dtype) print(arr2.dtype) print(arr3.dtype) NumPY Interview Questions import numpy as np # create numpy array arr = np.array([1, 2, 4, 6]) # To reverse array reverse_arr = arr[::-1] print(reverse_arr) Output: [6 4 2 1] Method 2: flipud function: This function is provided by NumPy to reverse the NumPy array. Let us see the below example about its usage. import numpy as np # create numpy array arr = np.array([1, 2, 4, 5, 6]) #flipud method for reversing reverse_arr = np.flipud(arr) print(reverse_arr) Output: [6 5 4 2 1]"
"8. How is np.mean() diﬀerent from np.average() in NumPy? np.mean() method calculates the arithmetic mean and provides additional options for input and results. For example, it has the option to specify what data types have to be taken, where the result has to be placed etc. np.average() computes the weighted average if the weights parameter is specified. In the case of weighted average, instead of considering that each data point is contributing equally to the final average, it considers that some data points have more weightage than the others (unequal contribution). NumPY Interview Questions"
"9. How do you count the frequency of a given positive value appearing in the NumPy array? We can make use of the bincount() function to compute the number of times a given value is there in the array. This function accepts only positive integers and boolean expressions as the arguments. import numpy as np arr = np.array([1, 2, 1, 3, 5, 0, 0, 0, 2, 3]) result = np.bincount(arr) print(result) The result is: [3 2 2 2 0 1] It has to be noted here that each element represents the count of the corresponding index value present in the original array. This is demonstrated in the below image:"
"10. How do we check for an empty array (or zero elements array)? NumPY Interview Questions We can check for the emptiness of a NumPy array by making use of the size attribute. Let us consider the below example. We have NumPy array arr filled with zeros. If the size element returns zero, that means the array is empty or it only consists of zeros. import numpy as np arr = np.zeros((1,0)) #returns empty array print(arr.size) #returns 0 This return 0"
"11. How is arr[:,0] diﬀerent from arr[:,[0]] arr[:,0] - Returns 0th index elements of all rows. In other words, return the first column elements. import numpy as np arr = np.array([[1,2,3,4],[5,6,7,8]]) new_arr =arr[:,0] print(new_arr) Output: [1 5] arr[:,[0]] - This returns the elements of the first column by adding extra dimension to it. import numpy as np arr = np.array([[1,2,3,4],[5,6,7,8]]) new_arr =arr[:,[0]] print(new_arr) Output: [[1] [5]] NumPY Interview Questions"
"12. How do you multiply 2 NumPy array matrices? We can make use of the dot() for multiplying matrices represented as NumPy arrays. This is represented in the code snippet below: import numpy as np # NumPy matrices A = np.arange(15,24).reshape(3,3) B = np.arange(20,29).reshape(3,3) print(""A: "",A) print(""B: "",B) # Multiply A and B result = A.dot(B) print(""Result: "", result) Output A: [[15 16 17] [18 19 20] [21 22 23]] B: [[20 21 22] [23 24 25] [26 27 28]] Result: [[1110 1158 1206] [1317 1374 1431] [1524 1590 1656]]"
"13. How do you concatenate 2 NumPy arrays? Concatenating 2 arrays by adding elements to the end can be achieved by making use of the concatenate() method of the NumPy package. Syntax: np.concatenate((a1, a2, ...), axis=0, out=None) where, a1,a2: arrays of the same shape axis: Represents the axis along which the arrays are joined. The default value is 0. out: If mentioned, it specifies the destination for placing the result. NumPY Interview Questions For example: import numpy as np a = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]]) b = np.array([[5, 6]]) # Concatenate with axis 0 c = np.concatenate((a,b), axis=0) print(""With axis 0: \\n"",c ) # Concatenate with axis 1 (b.T represents transpose matrix) d = np.concatenate((a,b.T), axis=1) print(""With axis 1: \\n"",d ) The output would be: With axis 0: [[1 2] [3 4] [5 6]] With axis 1: [[1 2 5] [3 4 6]] Notice how the arrays are concatenated with diﬀerent values of the axis."
"14. How do you convert Pandas DataFrame to a NumPy array? The to_numpy() method of the NumPy package can be used to convert Pandas DataFrame, Index and Series objects. Consider we have a DataFrame df, we can either convert the whole Pandas DataFrame df to NumPy array or even select a subset of Pandas DataFrame to NumPy array by using the to_numpy() method as shown in the example below: NumPY Interview Questions import pandas as pd import numpy as np # Pandas DataFrame df = pd.DataFrame(data={'A': [3, 2, 1], 'B': [6,5,4], 'C': [9, 8, 7]}, index=['i', 'j', 'k']) print(""Pandas DataFrame: "") print(df) # Convert Pandas DataFrame to NumPy Array np_arr = df.to_numpy() print(""Pandas DataFrame to NumPy array: "") print(np_arr) # Convert specific columns of Pandas DataFrame to NumPy array arr = df[['B', 'C']].to_numpy() print(""Convert B and C columns of Pandas DataFrame to NumPy Array: "") print (arr) The output of the above code is Pandas DataFrame: A B C i 3 6 9 j 2 5 8 k 1 4 7 Pandas DataFrame to NumPy array: [[3 6 9] [2 5 8] [1 4 7]] Convert B and C columns of Pandas DataFrame to NumPy Array: [[6 9] [5 8] [4 7]] NumPY Interview Questions for Experienced"
"15. What do you understand by Vectorization in NumPy? NumPY Interview Questions Function Vectorization technically means that the function is applied to all elements in the array. Typically, certain python functionalities on arrays (such as loops) are slower in nature because python arrays can contain elements of diﬀerent data types. Since the C program expects a specific datatype, there are chances of compiler optimisation which makes C code run faster. Since NumPy arrays support storing elements of a single datatype, most of the implementations of the functions written in NumPy meant for arithmetic, logical operations etc have optimised C program code under their hood. Additionally, NumPy also helps developers create their own vectorised functions by following the below steps: Write your required function that takes array elements as parameters. Vectorize the function by making use of the vectorize() method of the NumPy package. Give array inputs to the vectorized function. The below example demonstrates the process of vectorization. import numpy as np # Define your function def add(arr1, arr2): return (arr1 + arr2) arr1 = np.array([1,2,3]) arr2 = np.array([4,5,6]) #vectorize add method vectorized_add = np.vectorize(add) #call vectorized method result = vectorized_add(arr1, arr2) print(result) The output of above code [5 7 9]"
"16. How is vstack() diﬀerent from hstack() in NumPy? NumPY Interview Questions Both methods are used for combining the NumPy arrays. The main diﬀerence is that the hstack method combines arrays horizontally whereas the vstack method combines arrays vertically. For example, consider the below code. import numpy as np a = np.array([1,2,3]) b = np.array([4,5,6]) # vstack arrays c = np.vstack((a,b)) print(""After vstack: \\n"",c) # hstack arrays d = np.hstack((a,b)) print(""After hstack: \\n"",d) The output of this code would be: After vstack: [[1 2 3] [4 5 6]] After hstack: [1 2 3 4 5 6] Notice how a"
"17. How do you find the local peaks (or maxima) in a 1-D NumPy Array? Peaks are the points that are surrounded by smaller value points on either side as shown in the image below: NumPY Interview Questions There are two ways of finding local maxima: Using .where() method: This method lists all positions/indices where the element value at position i is greater than the element on either side of it. This method does not check for the points that have only one neighbour. This is demonstrated in the example below: Output: [ 2 5 7 11]] import numpy as np # define NumPy array arr = np.array([1, 4, 8, 1, 3, 5, 1, 6, 1, -5, -1, 19, 2]) maxima_peaks_positions = np.where((arr[1:-1] > arr[0:-2]) * (arr[1:-1] > arr[2:]))[0] + print(maxima_peaks_positions) NumPY Interview Questions The +1 at the end of the expression is required as it finds the indexes within the slice arr[1:-1] and not the entire array arr. The where() method returns a tuple of arrays where the first element is our required array. Hence we add [0] a"
18. How is Vectorization related to Broadcasting in NumPy? NumPY Interview Questions Vectorization involves delegating NumPy operations internally to optimized C language functions to result in faster Python code. Whereas Broadcasting refers to the methods that allow NumPy to perform array-related arithmetic operations. The size or shape of the arrays does not matter in this case. Broadcasting solves the problem of mismatched shaped arrays by replicating the smaller array along the larger array to ensure both arrays are having compatible shapes for NumPy operations. Performing Broadcasting before Vectorization helps to vectorize operations which support arrays of diﬀerent dimensions.
19. What happens when the split() method is used for splitting NumPy arrays?
"1. np.split() : Equally splits arrays into multiple sub-arrays. It raises Value Error when the split cannot be equal. Syntax: np.split(array, sections, axis=0) where, array - array that needs to be split sections - If we give an integer X, X equal sub-arrays are obtained a"
"20. What happens when we use the arrays_split() method for splitting the NumPy array? The array_split() method is similar to the split() method as it helps in splitting a given array to multiple subarrays. The main diﬀerence is that the array_split() allows sections to be an integer which does not result in equal array division. For an array of length L, if we want it to split to N subarrays, then L % N subarrays of size (L//N + 1) and remaining subarrays are of size L//N. NumPY Interview Questions In the above figure, we see there are 5 elements in the array, we want to split the array to 3 subarrays. So L % N = 5%3 = 2 subarrays of size (L//N +1) = (5//3 +1) = 2 are returned and remaining 1 subarray of size L//N = 1 is returned. Syntax: np.array_split(array, sections, axis=0) where, array - Given Input array. sections - List of indices or Number of subarrays to be returned. axis - Axis along which values have to be appended. The code for the example illustrated above is: import numpy as np arr = np.arange(5.0) split_arrs = np.array_split(arr, 3) split_arrs Output: NumPY Interview Questions [array([0., 1.]), array([2., 3.]), array([4.])]"
"21. How will you implement the moving average for the 1D array in NumPy? We can make use of the convolve() method. Here, it leverages the way discrete convolution is computed and uses it to find the rolling mean (moving average). Here, the sequence of ones of length equal to the length of the sliding window is convolved with the array. We first define a calculate_moving_average function which performs the convolution of an array with the sequence of ones of sliding window length w. The mode of the convolve method will be ‘valid’ to generate the points only where the overlapping of the sequence is complete. import numpy as np def calculate_moving_average(arr, w): return np.convolve(arr, np.ones(w),'valid')/w The above-defined function can be then used for finding the moving average as shown in the examples below: arr1 = np.array([4,5,8,9,3,2,4,2,0,2]) print(""Moving average of window length 2: "") av1 = calculate_moving_average(arr1, 2) print(av1) print(""Moving average of window length 4: "") av2 = calculate_moving_average(arr1, 4) print(av2) Output: Moving average of window length 2: [4.5 6.5 8.5 6. 2.5 3. 3. 1. 1. ] Moving average of window length 4: [6.5 6.25 5.5 4.5 2.75 2. 2. ] NumPY Interview Questions"

For example, If you have the below array: [[ 1. 1. 1. 1.] [ 1. 1. 1. 1.] [ 1. 1. 1. 1.]] The resultant array should be: (zeros on the border and 1s within it) [[ 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.] [ 0. 1. 1. 1. 1. 0.] [ 0. 1. 1. 1. 1. 0.] [ 0. 1. 1. 1. 1. 0.] [ 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]] NumPY Interview Questions Solution:- This can be achieved by using the pad method of the NumPy library. Output: Transformed array: [[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.] [0. 1. 1. 1. 1. 0.] [0. 1. 1. 1. 1. 0.] [0. 1. 1. 1. 1. 0.] [0. 1. 1. 1. 1. 0.] [0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]] import numpy as np # Create NumPy arrays filled with ones ones_arr = np.ones((4,4)) print(""Transformed array:"") transformed_array = np.pad(ones_arr, pad_width=1, mode='constant', constant_values=0) print(transformed_array) NumPY Interview Questions"
"29. Write a program for changing the dimension of a NumPy array. We can achieve this by overriding the shape attribute of the NumPy array. Sample Solution: import numpy as np #Create NumPy array arr = np.array([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]) print(""Original Shape: "", arr.shape) # Change the shape/dimension of the array arr.shape = (3, 3) print(""Transformed Matrix :"") print(arr) print(""Transformed Shape: "",arr.shape) Output: Original Shape: (9,) Transformed Matrix : [[1 2 3] [4 5 6] [7 8 9]] Transformed Shape: (3, 3) In this approach, care has to be taken w.r.t the number of elements present in the original array before changing the dimensions. Otherwise, it will result in the ValueError as shown below: import numpy as np # We have array of 8 elements arr = np.array([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]) # We are trying to convert the 1D array to a 3D array which expects 9 elements arr.shape = (3, 3) print(arr) Running this code would result in: NumPY Interview Questions 1 import numpy as np 2 arr = np.array([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]) ----> 3 arr.shape = (3, 3) 4 print(arr) ValueError: cannot reshape array of size 8 into shape (3,3)"
iOS Interview Questions iOS Interview Questions for Freshers
"1. Explain the Architecture of iOS. iOS operates in a Layered structure. iOS Architecture is comprised of four layers, each of which oﬀers a programming framework for creating applications that operate on top of the hardware. Communication will be enhanced by the layers between the Application Layer and the Hardware Layer. A lower-level layer provides the services that all applications require, while an upper-level layer (or high-level layer) provides graphics and interface-related services. iOS Interview Questions Core OS ( or Application) Layer: Core OS Layer sits directly on top of the device hardware and is the bottom layer of the iPhone OS stack. In addition to basic operating system services, such as memory management, handling of file systems, and threads, this layer provides low-level networking, access to external accessories, etc. Service Layer: Its purpose is to design the services that upper layers or users demand. Among its other essential features are block objects, Grand Central Dispatch, in-app purchases, and iCloud storage. The service layer has been strengthened by the addition of ARC Automatic Reference Counting. Media Layer: It handles media like video, audio, graphics, etc. The media layer will allow us to use all graphics, video, and audio technology of the system. Cocoa Touch Layer: It is also known as the application layer. This is the place where frameworks are created when applications are built. In addition, it functions as the interface for iOS users to work with the operating system. This includes touch and motion capabilities."
"2. What do you mean by property in iOS? Properties are basically values that are associated with a class, struct, or enum. They can be thought of as ""sub-variables,"" i.e., parts of another object. Example: struct Icecream { var flavor: String = """" } var choco = Icecream() choco.flavor = ""Chocolate Icecream"" In the above code, we created a structure called Icecream. One of its properties is called flavor, a String whose initial value is empty. Classification of Properties Stored Properties: This type of property can be used to store constant or variable values as instances and is usually provided by classes and structures. iOS Interview Questions Example: class Programmer { var progName: String let progLanguage: String var totalExperience = 0 var secondLanguage: String? } Above, the Programmer class defines four stored properties: progName, progLanguage, totalExperience, and secondLanguage. These are all stored properties since they can contain values that are part of the instance of the class. The above example shows properties with and without default values, as well as an optional one. Computed properties: These properties can be used to calculate values instead of storing them and are usually provided by classes, enumerations, and structures. Example: struct Angle { var degrees: Double = 0 var rads: Double { get { return degrees * .pi / 180 } set(newRads) { degrees = newRads * 180 / .pi } } } As mentioned above, the angle structure has a stored property called degrees for storing angles in degrees. Moreover, angles can also be expressed in radians, so the Angle structure contains a Rads property, which is a computed property. iOS Interview Questions"
"3. Can you explain the diﬀerence between atomic and nonatomic properties? What is the default for synthesized properties? Atomic Property: It is the default property and ensures a valid value will be returned from the getter or set by the setter. This ensures that only one thread can access the getter/setter of a given property at a time and that all other threads must wait until the first thread releases the getter/setter. Despite being thread-safe, it is not fast, since it ensures that the process is completely completed. Non-Atomic Property: With non-atomic properties, multiple threads can access the getter/setter method of a given property at the same time, so the potential for inconsistency between values exists. They come with enhanced access, but no guarantee of the return value."
"4. What are diﬀerent types of iOS Application States? During the course of its execution, an iOS application goes through a series of states. Each of these states is referred to as an application's lifecycle state. Below are the five possible states for an iOS app: iOS Interview Questions Not running: In the Not Running state, an application has either not been launched or has been closed/shut down by the system. Inactive: A brief state of inactivity occurs while the app is leaving or entering its active state. Despite running in the foreground, it isn't yet ready to accept user input or events. This means that the application remains inactive at this time. Active: The Active state indicates that the app is running in the foreground and receiving events. This is usually the normal mode for foreground apps and the User Interface is accessible. Background: During this state, the application's user interface is hidden, but it continues to run in the background of the iOS system. Applications usually pass through this state prior to being suspended. Suspended: In this case, the application is in the background but is not running code. However, it stays in my memory. Under low memory conditions, the system can delete apps in the suspended state without warning."
5. What is an iOS developer and what are his responsibilities? An iOS developer is a programmer or so
"6. State the diﬀerence between Android and iOS. iOS Interview Questions Android: It is the mobile operating system for Android devices oﬀered by Google LLC (limited liability company) and is focused on touchscreen mobile devices like smartphones and tablets. Several programming languages were used in its development, including C, Java, C++, and others. iOS: It is the operating system for Apple devices oﬀered by Apple incorporation and it is considered the second most popular mobile operating system globally a"
"7. What do you mean by deep linking in iOS? Deep links are links that send users directly to an app directly instead of a website or store using URI (Uniform resource locator) or universal links. The URL scheme is a well-known method of having deep links, but Universal Links are Apple's new approach to connecting your web page and your app under the same link. Deep linking involves not only creating a clickable link that opens up your app, but also a smart one that navigates to the resource you desire. Users are directed straight to in- app locations using these links, which saves them the time and eﬀort of finding those pages themselves thus improving their user experience tremendously. Explanation: If you use the URL fb://, you may open the Facebook app. However, if you use fb://profile/33138223345, you will open Wikipedia's profile in the Facebook app."
"8. Explain what is GCD (Grand Central Dispatch) in iOS. iOS Interview Questions Grand Central Dispatch (GCD) is a low-level API that enables users to run concurrent tasks (occurring simultaneously) by managing threads in the background. Grand Central Dispatch is Apple's solution to build concurrency and parallelism into iOS applications, so multiple background tasks can be run concurrently in the background without aﬀecting the main thread. It was introduced in iOS 4 to avoid the tedious process of serial execution of tasks."
9. What is ARC (Automatic Reference Counting)? In the Swi
"10. State the diﬀerence between Cocoa and Cocoa Touch. Cocoa and Cocoa Touch are two of Apple's widely used application frameworks used for building applications. However, they diﬀer in the following ways: iOS Interview Questions Cocoa Cocoa Touch It is an application framework for building applications that run on Mac OS X. It is the application framework for building applications that run on devices like iPhones and iPad. Frameworks such as Foundation and AppKit are incorporated into Cocoa. Cocoa Touch is a combination of Frameworks such as Foundation and UIKit are incorporated into Cocoa Touch. Cocoa classes use the NS (used for all classes and constants in the cocoa framework) prefix (like NSTextField, NSWindow). Cocoa Touch classes, on the other hand, use the UI (used for all classes and constants in the cocoa touch framework) prefix (like UITextField and UIWindow)."
11. Which programming languages are used for iOS development? iOS development is done using the following programming languages: HTML5 .NET C C++ Swi
"12. What is the framework that is utilized to build an application's interface for iOS? Contrary to the Foundation framework that defines classes, protocols, and functions for both iOS and OS X development, UIKit is specifically designed for iOS development. In iOS, the user interface and graphical infrastructure of the application are developed using UIKit. It includes: Event handling (handle diﬀerent gestures like input gestures, button-tap gestures, multi-touch gestures, etc.) App structure (Manages the interaction between the system and user) User Interface (Provides user interactions, the ability to share text and content, select images, edit videos, print files, etc.) Graphic, Drawing, and Printing"
"13. Write diﬀerent ways to achieve concurrency in iOS? Concurrency means ""running multiple tasks simultaneously"". Concurrency allows iOS devices to handle background tasks (such as downloading or processing data) while maintaining a responsive user interface. In iOS, you can manage concurrent tasks using Grand Central Dispatch (or GCD), and Operations (formally known as NSOperation). In order to achieve concurrency, iOS provides three ways as follows: iOS Interview Questions Dispatch queues: They are used to manage tasks in first-in-first-out (FIFO) order and execute tasks sequentially or concurrently. This is an easy way to handle asynchronous (not occurring at the same time) and concurrent tasks in your application. Threads: An independent sequence of instructions can be executed separately from other code within a program. Through threads, one can execute multiple code paths simultaneously in a single application. Having a thread is especially useful when you need to perform a lengthy task without aﬀecting the execution of the rest of the program. Operation Queues: Operation queue objects are invoked in accordance with their priority and readiness. Essentially, operation queues are high-level abstractions of queueing models, built on top of GCD (Grand Central Dispatch). It is possible, therefore, to execute tasks concurrently, just like GCD, but in an object-oriented manner."
"14. State the diﬀerence between App ID and Bundle ID? Bundle ID: They are the unique identifiers of applications in Apple's ecosystem. In other words, no two applications can have the same identifier. The bundling ID is used for both OS X and iOS apps and can be used to recognize app updates. Example: If our organization’s domain is scaler.com and we create an app named Edge, you could assign the string com.scaler.edge as our app’s bundle ID. App ID: This string uniquely identifies one or more apps from the same development team. There are two components to the string, the Team ID and the Bundle ID, separated by a period (.). Apple supplies a Team ID to identify a specific development team, whereas developers supply Bundle IDs to identify a single app or a collection of apps. Example: ABCDE12345.com.scaler.edge In the above example, ABCDE12345 is the Team ID and com.scaler.edge is the Bundle ID. iOS Interview Questions"
"15. What do you mean by the SpriteKit and SceneKit framework in the context of game development? SpriteKit: This framework is designed to make it easier and faster for game developers to create animated 2D assets/objects in casual games. With it, you can draw shapes, particles, text, images, and videos in two dimensions. SceneKit: It is an iOS framework inherited from OS X, which helps to create 3D graphics. With SceneKit, you can build 3D animated scenes and eﬀects for your iOS games and apps."
"16. Write the diﬀerence between assign and retain keywords. Assign: With Assign, a reference is created from one object to another without increasing the source's retain count (a number that keeps track of how many objects are “holding onto"" another object). It does not copy or retain the value but assigns it directly to the instance variable. Example: if (object != object) { [object release]; object = nil; object = object; } Here, Assign will generate a setter that assigns the value to the instance variable directly, rather than copying or retaining it. Retain: Using this method, you create a reference from one object to another and increase the retain count of the source object. Example: iOS Interview Questions if (object != object) { [object release]; object = nil; object = [object retain]; } A retain message prevents an object from being deallocated until you are done using it. iOS Interview Questions for Experienced"
"17. Explain Objective-C in OS. Since the 1990s, Objective-C has been used by Apple as an object-oriented programming language. This language combines the advantages of two earlier languages - C and Smalltalk. As a superset of C, it provides object-oriented functionality and a dynamic runtime environment. Features: iOS Interview Questions In Objective C, meta classes are automatically created and managed during runtime. Dynamic typing and static typing are both supported. It is easy to understand."
"18. Name the most important data types in Objective-C? Following are data types that the developers mostly use in Objective – C: BOOL: Represents a Boolean value that is either true or false. Both the _Bool or BOOL keywords is valid. Example: _Bool flag = 0; BOOL secondflag = 1; NSInteger: Represents an Integer. Example: typedef long NSInteger; typedef int NSInteger; NSUInteger: Represents an unsigned integer. Example: typedef unsigned long NSUInteger; typedef unsigned int NSUInteger; NSString: Represents a string. Example: NSString *greeting = @""Hello"";"

21. Explain NSError in Swi
22. What is Enum or Enumerations in Swi
"23. What do you mean by lazy property in iOS? iOS Interview Questions Lazy properties are properties whose initial value isn't computed until the first time they are used. Including the lazy modifier/keyword before the declaration of a stored property indicates it is lazy. This lets you delay the initialization of stored properties. This could be a great way to streamline your code and reduce unnecessary work. When a code is expensive and unlikely to be called consistently, a lazy variable can be a great solution. Example: class Person { var name: String lazy var personalizdgreeting : String = { return “HelloScala \\(self.name)!” }() init(name: String) { self.name = name } } As shown above, we aren't sure what value personalizedgreeting should have. To know the correct greeting for this person, we need to wait until this object is initialized."
24. What are generics in swi
25. Explain dictionary in Swi
"26. Why design patterns are important? Name some of the popular design patterns used in iOS? A design pattern is a solution to a specific problem you might encounter while designing an app's architecture. They are templates designed to make coding easier and more reusable for you. Following are some of the design patterns that can be used in iOS: MVC (Model-View-Controller): MVC is a design pattern for developing web applications in which three components are connected i.e., view, controller, and model. Views can be conceived as the user interface shown to the end-user at a certain point in time. The model represents the data to be shown on the view. The controller acts as a link between view and model. There is always a relationship between these three components. iOS Interview Questions MVVM (Model-View-View Model): Unlike MVM, there is a special layer in MVVM called the View Model between the View and the Model. Using a view model, model information can be transformed into values that can be displayed on the view. There is a binding link between the view and View model that allows the view model to share updates with the view. Facade: The facade design pattern provides a simplified (but limited) interface to a complex set of classes, libraries or frameworks. As opposed to providing the user with a set of classes and their APIs, you instead provide a simple, unified API. While Facade helps to reduce overall application complexity, it also helps to move unwanted dependencies to a single location. iOS Interview Questions"
27. What is the JSON framework supported by iOS? iOS supports the SBJson framework as the JSON framework. Humans and computers alike can easily read and write this lightweight data exchange formatter. JSON handling is simplified with SBJson's flexible APIs and additional control.

30. Explain TDD (Test-Driven Development). So
"31. Explain the function of the completion handler. Completion handlers are basically just functions passed as parameters to other functions. They are used to dealing with the response of asynchronous tasks since we do not know when they will end. Completion handlers inform an application when an operation, such as an API call, has been completed. The program is informed that the next step needs to be executed. Example: Let's create a simple class called CompletionHandler that has one method called count that counts from 0 to 50. Once it reaches 25 (a random value), it will make a network request to https://scaler.com. Once the request has been completed, we will print Received response. iOS Interview Questions You will see all the numbers printed out in the console as soon as the code runs, but the Received response will be printed only a"
"32. State the diﬀerence between strong, weak, read only and copy. The diﬀerence between strong, weak, read-only and copy is as follows: Strong: This property maintains a reference to property throughout the lifetime of an object. When you declare strong, you intend to ""own"" the object you are referencing. Data you assign to this property will not be destroyed as long as you or any other object references it strongly. Weak: It means that the object should be kept in memory as long as someone points to it strongly, and you don't need control over its lifetime. Read-only: An object's property can be defined initially, but it cannot be altered or modified. Copy: This attribute is an alternative to strong. In place of taking ownership of a current object, it creates a copy of whatever you assign to the property, then takes ownership of that copy."
"33. What do you mean by dynamic dispatch? class CompletionHandler { func count() { for i in 0...50 { if i == 25 { if let url = URL(string: ""https://scaler.com"") { URLSession.shared.dataTask(with: url) { (data, response, error) in print(""Received response"") }.resume() } } print(""I = "", i) } } } let newInstance = CompletionHandler() newInstance.count() iOS Interview Questions In simple terms, dynamic dispatch means that the program decides at runtime which implementation of a particular method or function it needs to invoke. In the case where a subclass overrides a method of its superclass, dynamic dispatch determines whether to invoke the subclass implementation of the method or the parents."
"34. Explain the @dynamic and @synthesize commands in Objective-C. @synthesize: This command generates getter and setter methods within the property and works in conjunction with the @dynamic command. By default, @synthesize creates a variable with the same name as the target of set/get as shown in the below example. Example1: @property (nonatomic, retain) NSButton *someButton; ... @synthesize someButton; It is also possible to specify a member variable as its set / get target as shown below: Example2: @property (nonatomic, retain) NSButton *someButton; ... @synthesize someButton= _homeButton; Here, the set / get method points to the member variable _homeButton. @dynamic: This tells the compiler that the getter and setter methods are not implemented within the class itself, but elsewhere (like the superclass or that they will be available at runtime). Example: @property (nonatomic, retain) IBOutlet NSButton *someButton; ... @dynamic someButton;"
"35. How can you implement storage and persistence in iOS? iOS Interview Questions Persistence means storing data on the disk so that it can be retrieved without being altered the next time the app is opened. From simple to complex, there are the following methods for storing data: Data structures such as arrays, dictionaries, sets, and other data structures are perfect for storing data intermediately. NSUserDefaults and Keychains are both simple key-value stores. NSUserDefaults is insecure, whereas Keychains is secure. A file or disk storage is a way to store data (serialized or not) to or from a disk using NSFileManager. Relational databases, such as SQLite, are good for implementing complex querying mechanisms."
HTML Interview Questions HTML Interview Questions and Answers

But still, there are few things which are templated and are globally accepted way to structure the web page, such as: HTML Interview Questions <header>: Stores the starting information about the web page. <footer>: Represents the last section of the page. <nav>: The navigation menu of the HTML page. <article>: It is a set of information. <section>: It is used inside the article block to define the basic structure of a page. <aside>: Sidebar content of the page."
"11. How to optimize website assets loading? To optimize website load time we need to optimize its asset loading and for that: CDN hosting - A CDN or content delivery network is geographically distributed servers to help reduce latency. File compression - This is a method that helps to reduce the size of an asset to reduce the data transfer File concatenation - This reduces the number of HTTP calls Minify scripts - This reduces the overall file size of js and CSS files Parallel downloads - Hosting assets in multiple subdomains can help to bypass the download limit of 6 assets per domain of all modern browsers. This can be configured but most general users never modify these settings. Lazy Loading - Instead of loading all the assets at once, the non-critical assets can be loaded on a need basis."
12. What are the various formatting tags in HTML? HTML has various formatting tags: HTML Interview Questions <b> - makes text bold <i> - makes text italic <em> - makes text italic but with added semantics importance <big> - increases the font size of the text by one unit <small> - decreases the font size of the text by one unit <sub> - makes the text a subscript <sup> - makes the text a superscript <del> - displays as strike out text <strong> - marks the text as important <mark> - highlights the text <ins> - displays as added text

It was originally developed by Facebook to improve the performance of its iOS and Android apps. Since then, it has been adopted by many other companies, including Google, Yahoo, and Mozilla. When using jQuery Mobile, you can use the library to create a mobile-first app that is faster and easier to maintain than traditional web apps. It also makes it easier to add new features to your app without having to rewrite your code. JQuery Mobile is built on top of the jQuery JavaScript library. It works by using the same techniques that are used when you are developing a traditional web app. However, instead of using JavaScript, jQuery Mobile uses HTML5 and CSS3 to create a modern and easy-to-use framework for developing mobile apps."
"7. What is the $() function in the jQuery library? The $() function is used to access the properties of elements in the DOM (Document Object Model). $() is similar to javascript’s selector functions, but it is more powerful and has more options. $() can be used to access attributes, classes, id, data-* attributes, and more. Example - Suppose you want to change the colour of all the heading1 (h1) to green, then you can do this with the help of jQuery as - $(document).ready(function() { $(""h1"").css(""background-color"", ""green""); });"
"8. Explain $(document).ready() function? The $(document).ready() function is a jQuery extension that allows you to immediately run code when the document is ready. It's most commonly used to initialize a new page or to load scripts or styles into the document. However, it can also be used to load a script or style into the document at any time. The $(document).ready() function is useful for loading scripts or styles into the document at any time. It's not useful for loading scripts or styles into the document when the document is already loaded. jQuery Interview Questions"
"9. What is the exact diﬀerence between the methods onload() and document.ready()? The onload() and document.ready() methods are used to load and render the HTML and JavaScript code that is needed to display the page. However, they are diﬀerent methods in that they use diﬀerent approaches to loading the HTML and JavaScript code. The exact diﬀerences are - onload() document.ready() The onload() method is used to load the HTML code.The document.ready() method is used to load the JavaScript code. The onload() method loads the HTML code using a pre-compiled object that is passed to the onload event handlerThe document.ready() method loads the JavaScript code using a pre-compiled object that is passed to the document.ready event handler."
"10. Describe jQuery Connect in brief. Also, list its uses. JQuery connect is a JavaScript library that provides a declarative API for binding data to elements. It allows you to specify the data source, the element that should be bound to the data, and the callback function that will be invoked when the element is bound. The most common use case for jQuery connect is binding data to an element using an attribute or value. However, it can also be used to bind data to elements dynamically or to bind data to an element based on a condition."
11. What are the jQuery functions used to provide eﬀects? Some of the methods are listed below which provide the eﬀect: jQuery Interview Questions
"1. toggle() : This function is used to check the visibility of selected elements to toggle between hide() and show() for the selected elements where: show() is run when the element is hidden. hide() is run when the element is visible. Syntax: $(selector).toggle(speed, easing, callback)"
"2. slideDown() : This function is used to either check the visibility of selected elements or to show the hidden elements. We can use this function on the following types of hidden elements: Elements that are hidden using jQuery methods. Elements that are hidden using display: none in the element’s CSS properties. Syntax: $(selector).slideDown( speed, easing, callback )"
"3. fadeOut(): This function is used to change the level of opacity for element of choice from visible to hidden. When used, the fadded element will not occupy any space in DOM. Syntax: $(selector).fadeOut( speed, easing, callback )"
"4. fadeToggle(): This is used for toggling between the fadeIn() and fadeOut() methods. If elements are faded in state, fadeToggle() will fade out those elements. If elements are faded out, fadeToggle() will fade in those elements. Syntax: $(selector).fadeToggle(speed, easing, callback)"
"5. animate(): jQuery Interview Questions The method performs custom animation of a set of CSS properties. This method changes an element from one state to another with CSS styles. The CSS property value is changed gradually, to create an animated eﬀect. Syntax: (selector).animate({styles},speed,easing,callback) where “styles” is a required field that specifies one or more CSS properties/values to animate. The properties need to be mentioned in camel casing style. The parameters “speed”, “easing” and “callback” in the syntaxes of the above methods represent: speed: Optional parameter and used for specifying the speed of the eﬀect. The default value is 400 milliseconds. The possible value of speed are “slow”, “fast” or some number in milliseconds. easing: Again optional parameter is used for specifying the speed of elements to diﬀerent types of animation. The default value is “swing”. The possible value of easing are “swing” and “linear”. callback: Optional parameter. The callback function specified here is executed a"
12. What is the use of css() method in jQuery? The css() method is used to change the style property of the selected element.
"13. Which jquery method is used to hide selected elements? The hide() function in jQuery is used to try and hide the chosen element. For Example - Suppose we need to hide a division tag, that consists of id = “ib”. Then the jQuery code will be - $(“#ib”).hide();"
"14. What are events in jQuery? User actions on a webpage are called events and handling responses to those is called event handling. jQuery provides simple methods for attaching event handlers to selected elements. When an event occurs, the provided function is executed."
"15. How to iterate/loop through all p elements in jquery. $.each() is an object iterator tool provided by jQuery, as is.each(), a jQuery collection iterator(). So for traversing all the p elements, the sample code is - jQuery Interview Questions $(""p"").each(function() { console.log( $(this).attr('id')); });"
16. What is the significance of jQuery.length? jQuery.length property is used to count the number of the elements of the jQuery object.
"17. What is jQuery click event? jQuery click event happens when we click on an HTML element. jQuery provides a method click() method that aids to trigger the click event. For example, $(“p”).click() will trigger the click event whenever the elements with paragraph tag are clicked on a browser page. Syntax: $(selector).click(function(){ //code that runs when the click event is triggered });"
"18. What is the purpose of JQuery's delay() method? Can you use this for diﬀerent types of browsers like (Internet Explorer)? The delay() method is used to set the delay between two events, such as a click or a change in state. The delay can be set to a number of diﬀerent values, including milliseconds, seconds, and even hours. This can be useful when you want to wait for an event to occur before doing something else. For example - you could use a delay of 5 minutes to wait for a user to click on your button before moving on to the next step in your workflow. Although the delay() method is not available in all browsers. In order to use it in Internet Explorer, you will need to add the following line of code: jQuery Interview Questions window.addEventListener('click', function() { delay(5000); }); But the latest Microso"
"19. Can you explain about ajaxStart() functions? The ajaxStart() event is a global event that occurs when an Ajax request begins, assuming no other Ajax requests are presently active. The ajaxStart() event can also be used to cancel a previously called Ajax callback or to start a new one. For example, suppose you have an online shopping cart application that allows customers to add items to their shopping cart when they are ready to checkout. An ajaxStart() event could be used to trigger a shopping cart initialization routine when the user first visits the application, or any time a new shopping cart is about to be initialized. Similarly, a shopping cart termination routine could be triggered when the user is finished shopping, or whenever a shopping cart is no longer needed."
"20. Can you explain about ajaxComplete() function? The ajaxComplete() is called regardless of whether the request is successful or fails, and a complete callback is returned, even for synchronous queries. This is very useful for error handling. If a request fails but the result is not needed immediately, it is transferred to a cache, and then called later. This is especially useful if you want to keep track of failed requests and retry those that were not successful. A typical scenario is the case of an AJAX request but no data is returned, or the data is returned but not as intended. In this case, you can call ajaxComplete() to get a new set of data and continue with your business logic. A successful AJAX request is not necessarily a reason to call ajaxComplete(). you can still do other stuﬀ while the data is being transferred from the server to the browser. For example, you can scroll, pause the video, or show a loading indicator. jQuery Interview Questions"
"21. Describe the benefits of jQuery Ajax techniques. With the aid of DOM and JavaScript, There is a great advantage of AJAX. Ajax can request and receive data from the server without requiring a page reload. jQuery Ajax methods are a powerful way to make your web applications more responsive. They enable you to take advantage of the power of Ajax by using JavaScript to make your web pages load faster and more eﬀiciently. By using jQuery Ajax methods, you can take advantage of the power of Ajax by using JavaScript to make your web pages load faster and more eﬀiciently. The following advantages of the AJAX Methods are - It allows us to eliminate the complete page reload and instead load only a portion of the page. API that is simple. Cross-browser compatibility. POST and GET are supported. Upload a JSON, XML, HTML, or script file."
"22. Can you tell something about jQuery each() method? The each() method in jQuery allows us to loop through diﬀerent datasets such as arrays or objects (even DOM objects). It can be used to loop through a number of DOM objects from the same selectors. For example, if you want to add a width=“600” to all the images in a page then we select all images and loop through each of them and add width = ""600"" to each tag. We can write the code as below: $(""img"").each(function(im){ $(this).attr(""width"",""600"") }); jQuery Interview Questions $ is a jQuery object definer. In the above syntax, “this” is a DOM object and we can apply jQuery functions to only jQuery objects which is why we convert the DOM object to jQuery object by wrapping it inside the $ definer. We can also use each() to loop through the arrays of data and get the index and the value of the position of data inside the array. For example, var list = [""InterviewBit"", ""jQuery"", ""Questions""]; $.each(list, function(index, value){ console.log(index + "" ""+ value); }) The above code prints 0 InterviewBit 1 jQuery 2 Questions You can also use each() to loop through objects. For example: var obj = {""name"":""InterviewBit"",""type"": ""jQuery""}; $.each(obj, function(key,value){ console.log(key + "" - "" + value); }) The above code prints: name - InterviewBit type - jQuery"
"23. What is CDN? jQuery Interview Questions CDN is an acronym that stands for Content Delivery Network or Content Distribution Network. It is a big distributed system of servers spread throughout the internet in many data centres. It downloads content from servers at a greater bandwidth, resulting in speedier loading times. Several firms oﬀer free public CDNs, including Google, Amazon, Microso"
"24. What is the diﬀerence between javascript and jquery? JavaScript is an interpreted language written in C and is a combination of ECMAScript and DOM whereas jQuery is a JavaScript library developed to run things faster and make things simplified for JavaScript. jQuery doesn't have the ECMAScript. JavaScript requires long lines of code to code a functionality whereas in the case of jQuery, just import the library and call the functions which would reduce the programmer’s eﬀort in coding. JavaScript doesn't have cross-browser compatible functionality which is why a developer has to write code manually to implement the functionality. Whereas the cross-browser code compatibility is inbuilt in jQuery."
"25. In jQuery, what is the diﬀerence between the $(window).load and $(document).ready functions? jQuery Interview Questions $(window).load $(document).ready $(window).load is an event that occurs when the DOM and another page's contents are fully loaded. This event occurs following the ready event. In most circumstances, the script may be run as soon as the DOM has finished loading.The ready() method is typically the ideal location to write JavaScript code However, there may be times when you need to write scripts in the load() method. For instance, to determine the true width and height of a picture. Once the DOM, CSS, pictures, and frames are entirely loaded, the $(window).load event is called. As a result, it is the optimal area to write jQuery code to determine the real picture size or to obtain information about anything.When a function needs to be made available a"
"26. What exactly is a jQuery Data Table plug-in? Also, explain the uses with examples. A data table plug-in is a jQuery plugin that can be used to create custom tables. It allows you to create a table with a custom layout, without having to write any code. It can be used to create tables with diﬀerent layouts, or even to create tables with custom columns. The data table plug-in is a great way to add extra functionality to your websites, especially if you want to add a table to your website that is not included in the default layout. Some of the uses for data tables are listed below - Data tables are great for displaying a lot of data at once. For example, you could display a list of products on your website. You could also display the same data in a table in your blog. Data tables are also great for displaying information that you want your visitors to see. For example, you could display a list of products that you're selling on your website. You could also display the same information in a table in your blog. Data tables are great for showing a lot of information in one place. For example, you could display a list. of products on your website and then add additional information about each product in the table."
"27. What is the purpose of JQuery's serialize() method? The serialize() method is a utility method of the jQuery library that allows you to serialize data from a DOM element and return it in a format that can be used by other libraries. This is useful when you want to pass data between diﬀerent libraries or frameworks, or if you want to create a custom API that can be used by other developers. For example - if you want to pass JSON data from your application to a third-party API, you can use the serialize() method to serialize the data and then pass it to the API. This way, the API knows how to handle the data, and you don't have to worry about the format of the data. jQuery Interview Questions The serialize() method is also useful when you need to send data between diﬀerent browsers. For example - if you want to send JSON data from one browser to another, you can use the serialize() method to serialize the data and then send it using a custom HTTP request. If you're not sure what data you need to serialize, there's an easy way to find out: Just type ""serialize"" into the console. You'll see a list of all the methods that are available on your element. ul> li>serialize/li> li>unserialize/li> /ul> div id=""example""> ul> li>serialize/li> li>unserialize/li> /ul> /div>"
"28. What are the selectors in jQuery? How many types of selectors in jQuery? In order to work with any element on the web page, we would first need to find it. Selectors find the HTML elements in jQuery. Some of the most commonly used and basic selectors are: Name: Used to select all elements which match the given element Name. #ID: Used to select a single element which matches with the given ID .Class: Used to select all elements which match with the given Class. Universal (*): Used to select all elements available in a DOM. Multiple Elements E, F, G: Used to select the combined results of all the specified selectors E, F or G. Attribute Selector: Used to select elements based on their attribute value."
"29. Explain how CSS classes can be manipulated in HTML using jQuery. Query provides several methods to manipulate the CSS classes assigned to HTML elements. The most important methods are addClass(), removeClass() and toggleClass(). jQuery Interview Questions addClass(): This method adds one or more classes to the selected elements. Syntax: $(selector).addClass(className); You can also add multiple classes to the selector. Syntax:$(selector).addClass(class1, class2); removeClass(): Similar to adding class, you can also remove the classes from the elements by using this method. The removeClass() method can remove a single class, multiple classes, or all classes at once from the selected elements. Syntax: For removing one class: $(selector).removeClass(class1); For removing multiple class: $(selector).removeClass(class1, class2, class 3); For removing all classes at once: $(selector).removeClass() toggleClass(): This method is used for adding or removing one or more classes from the selected elements in such a way that if the selected element already has the class, then it is removed. Else if an element does not have the specified class, then it is added i.e. it toggles the application of classes. Syntax: $(selector).toggleClass(className);"

"31. Explain jQuery no-conflict. jQuery no-conflict is a jQuery option that allows you to avoid conflicts between various javascript frameworks or libraries. When you utilize jQuery's no-conflict mode, you substitute the $ variable with a new variable and assign jQuery to other JavaScript libraries. In addition, the $ symbol is utilized as a function or variable name in jQuery. When no conflict is enabled, the $ symbol in jQuery becomes the global function name and not the library name. For example, you may use the $ function to access other libraries' data, but not their code. You can also use this option to avoid conflicts between various jQuery plugins."
"32. In jQuery, distinguish between the bind(), live(), and delegate() functions. The bind() function does not connect events to items added a"
"33. Explain the operation of the jQuery connect() method. The connect() method of jQuery is a utility function that allows you to create a new jQuery object and pass it to the jQuery object's constructor. This allows you to create a new object with the same functionality as the original object, but without having to manually set up the object's properties. For example, you can pass in an existing jQuery object and it will be automatically set up to use the same properties as the original object. When using connect() method, you can pass in a callback function that will be called when the new object is ready. The callback function can be used to perform any additional setup that needs to be done before the new object can be used. For example - you can set up a data source using the data() method of jQuery. When using connect() method, you can pass in a callback function that will be called when the new object is ready."
"34. Distinguish between jquery.min.js and jquery.js. jQuery Interview Questions The functionality of jquery.min.js and jquery.js is the same. However, If you are serving a page that contains a lot of JavaScript, it is a good idea to minify it. Minifying JavaScript (jquery.min.js) reduces the size of your file and makes it faster to load on all platforms. Minifying your code also reduces the chances that erroneous code will be rendered as a malicious attack because it makes it more diﬀicult to test. With minified JavaScript, you will get better page performance, faster loading, and shorter wait times for your visitors. There are also some of the major advantages of the jquery.min.js. - When JS files are minified in a production environment, they load faster and provide faster and better page performance. Minifying a script also reduces the size of the file in the server’s temporary directory and browser cache, which results in a faster download and a smaller server response. Another advantage of using minified JS is that it removes the need to include any external JS files in the HTML document. This makes it easier to structure the code and easier to edit the code."
"35. Explain the benefits of using a CDN for the jQuery files. Hosting jQuery on a Content Delivery Network (CDN) improves availability and performance at a reduced cost and with less network traﬀic, improves latency (the time it takes to send and receive a data packet from the server), and provides a device-specific version of the contents. CDNs are a great way to host your JavaScript and CSS files. By caching these files, you can reduce the amount of time it takes for your site to load, making it faster and more responsive. This is especially important for sites that serve large amounts of content, such as blogs or e-commerce sites. By using a CDN, you can also reduce the number of load times that occur when visitors access your site. In addition, by hosting your JavaScript and CSS files on a CDN, you can also reduce the amount of bandwidth that is consumed by your site. Example - It makes it simple to maintain responsiveness for mobile screen sizes, as well as safe storage space for important data or files. jQuery Interview Questions Caching JavaScript and CSS files on a CDN is an important optimization that should be considered when building a site with a lot of JavaScript and CSS files."
"36. In jQuery, what is the diﬀerence between $(this) and this. $(this) is a jQuery object, whereas this is a JavaScript global object reference. We may refer to DOM elements in HTML documents using this. $(this) refers to the parent object, whereas this is a DOM element that, in the case of an array, represents an object with the .each() method, which shows the current iteration. We use this as an alternative to this.parent() to refer to the parent object in JavaScript. This is more convenient than using this.parent(). We can also use this to refer to other elements in HTML, as in an ul element: var myElement = $('ul').each(function() { var childElement = this.parent().nextSibling(); }); This is useful when you need to iterate over a list of elements and their children, but you do not want to reference the parent object."
"37. Can you describe the various methods for extracting a query text using regular expressions? There are two methods for obtaining a query string using regular expressions. String-based approach: This method aids in the generation of Strings by comparing similar regular expressions using the.replace() function. Regular Express Based Approach: When compared to strings in JavaScript, the regular expression technique is the most powerful method for extracting a query string and pattern. Using the.exec() and.test() methods to compare against patterns. Other String methods include match(), matchAll(), replace(), search(), and split()."
"38. Explain the use of event.preventDefault() method. jQuery Interview Questions Event.PreventDefault is a jQuery event that stops an event from firing when the user clicks on a link or other trigger. It basically stops the default behaviour of the triggers and allows any other event to occur. It is useful for preventing unwanted events from firing when a user clicks on a link or other trigger. This can be useful when you want to prevent users from accidentally clicking on links that open up new windows or tabs. When you use an event like click or keypress, you can prevent the event from firing by adding the event.preventDefault() method to the event object. When you use event.preventDefault(), the event will not fire unless the user clicks on a link or other trigger. Event.preventDefault() is only available in jQuery 1.7 and later versions of jQuery. Example - Assume you're developing an AJAX-based application in which you need to submit form data through AJAX when a button in the form is clicked. So, if you click on a button without preventing it, the button behaves normally and the website reloads. As a result, the other event will not occur when you click the button. So, if we use prevent default there, we can skip the button's default behaviour and instead perform the AJAX event and alter the HTML DOM accordingly."
"39. What Are the Benefits of Using Jquery Instead of Javascript in an Asp.net Web Application? Below are some of the benefits of using jQuery instead of javascript in ASP.net Web Application - Jquery is well-written optimized javascript code, thus it will execute quicker until we create the same standard optimized javascript code. Jquery is javascript code that is succinct, which implies that it requires the least amount of code to do the same functionality as javascript. Jquery makes Javascript development faster since much of the functionality is already provided in the library and we only need to access it. Because Jquery supports cross-browser compatibility, we save time on supporting all browsers."
"40. What is event.stopPropagation()? jQuery Interview Questions event.stopPropagation() stops the event from propagating up the DOM tree, preventing any parent handlers from being notified of the event. For example, if a link with a click method is linked inside of a DIV or FORM that also has a click method attached, the DIV or FORM click method will not fire."
"41. Is it possible to pause or postpone the execution of the document.ready for a period of time? Yes, that is possible. With the release of jQuery 1.6, a new method called ""jQuery.holdReady(hold)"" was added. This function allows you to postpone the execution of the document.ready() event. The document.ready() event is triggered as soon as your DOM is ready, however, there may be occasions when you wish to load extra JavaScript or plugins that you have referenced."
"42. Would you still favor jQuery in a case when things can be done simply using javascript? No. If we can accomplish our goals using simple JavaScript, then we should avoid using jQuery. It is because the jQuery library is always xx kilobytes in size, thus there is no use in wasting bandwidth. And because jQuery is built on top of javascript, it has numerous functions that are more complicated than the simple job you can accomplish with javascript. jQuery will also load all dependencies. It will have some speed issues as compared to the javascript code. jQuery Coding Questions"

"Machine Learning Interview Questions The simplest answer is to make our lives easier. In the early days of “intelligent” applications, many systems used hardcoded rules of “if” and “else” decisions to process data or adjust the user input. Think of a spam filter whose job is to move the appropriate incoming email messages to a spam folder. But with the machine learning algorithms, we are given ample information for the data to learn and identify the patterns from the data. Unlike the normal problems we don’t need to write the new rules for each problem in machine learning, we just need to use the same workflow but with a diﬀerent dataset. Let’s talk about Alen Turing, in his 1950 paper, “Computing Machinery and Intelligence”, Alen asked, “Can machines think?” Full paper here The paper describes the “Imitation Game”, which includes three participants - Human acting as a judge, Another human, and A computer is an attempt to convince the judge that it is human. The judge asks the other two participants to talk. While they respond the judge needs to decide which response came from the computer. If the judge could not tell the diﬀerence the computer won the game. The test continues today as an annual competition in artificial intelligence. The aim is simple enough: convince the judge that they are chatting to a human instead of a computer chatbot program."
"2. What are Diﬀerent Types of Machine Learning algorithms? There are various types of machine learning algorithms. Here is the list of them in a broad category based on: Whether they are trained with human supervision (Supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement learning) The criteria in the below diagram are not exclusive, we can combine them any way we like.

"3. What is Supervised Learning? Supervised learning is a machine learning algorithm of inferring a function from labeled training data. The training data consists of a set of training examples. Example: 01 Knowing the height and weight identifying the gender of the person. Below are the popular supervised learning algorithms. Support Vector Machines Regression Naive Bayes Decision Trees K-nearest Neighbour Algorithm and Neural Networks. Example: 02 If you build a T-shirt classifier, the labels will be “this is an S, this is an M and this is L”, based on showing the classifier examples of S, M, and L."
"4. What is Unsupervised Learning? Machine Learning Interview Questions Unsupervised learning is also a type of machine learning algorithm used to find patterns on the set of data given. In this, we don’t have any dependent variable or label to predict. Unsupervised Learning Algorithms: Clustering, Anomaly Detection, Neural Networks and Latent Variable Models. Example: In the same example, a T-shirt clustering will categorize as “collar style and V neck style”, “crew neck style” and “sleeve types”."
"5. What is ‘Naive’ in a Naive Bayes? The Naive Bayes method is a supervised learning algorithm, it is naive since it makes assumptions by applying Bayes’ theorem that all attributes are independent of each other. Bayes’ theorem states the following relationship, given class variable y and dependent vector x1 through xn: P(yi | x1,..., xn) =P(yi)P(x1,..., xn | yi)(P(x1,..., xn) Using the naive conditional independence assumption that each xiis independent: for all I this relationship is simplified to: P(xi | yi, x1, ..., xi-1, xi+1, ...., xn) = P(xi | yi) Since, P(x1,..., xn) is a constant given the input, we can use the following classification rule: P(yi | x1, ..., xn) = P(y) ni=1P(xi | yi)P(x1,...,xn) and we can also use Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation to estimate P(yi)and P(yi | xi) the former is then the relative frequency of class yin the training set. P(yi | x1,..., xn) P(yi) ni=1P(xi | yi) y = arg max P(yi)ni=1P(xi | yi) Machine Learning Interview Questions The diﬀerent naive Bayes classifiers mainly diﬀer by the assumptions they make regarding the distribution of P(yi | xi): can be Bernoulli, binomial, Gaussian, and so on."
"6. What is PCA? When do you use it? Principal component analysis (PCA) is most commonly used for dimension reduction. In this case, PCA measures the variation in each variable (or column in the table). If there is little variation, it throws the variable out, as illustrated in the figure below: Principal component analysis (PCA) Thus making the dataset easier to visualize. PCA is used in finance, neuroscience, and pharmacology. It is very useful as a preprocessing step, especially when there are linear correlations between features."
"7. Explain SVM Algorithm in Detail A Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a very powerful and versatile supervised machine learning model, capable of performing linear or non-linear classification, regression, and even outlier detection. Machine Learning Interview Questions Suppose we have given some data points that each belong to one of two classes, and the goal is to separate two classes based on a set of examples. In SVM, a data point is viewed as a p-dimensional vector (a list of p numbers), and we wanted to know whether we can separate such points with a (p-1)-dimensional hyperplane. This is called a linear classifier. There are many hyperplanes that classify the data. To choose the best hyperplane that represents the largest separation or margin between the two classes. If such a hyperplane exists, it is known as a maximum-margin hyperplane and the linear classifier it defines is known as a maximum margin classifier. The best hyperplane that divides the data in H3 We have data (x1, y1), ..., (xn, yn), and diﬀerent features (xii, ..., xip), and yiis either 1 or -1. The equation of the hyperplane H3 is the set of points satisfying: w. x-b = 0 Where w is the normal vector of the hyperplane. The parameter b||w||determines the oﬀset of the hyperplane from the original along the normal vector w So for each i, either xiis in the hyperplane of 1 or -1. Basically, xisatisfies: w . xi - b 1 or w. xi - b -1 Machine Learning Interview Questions Support Vector Machine (SVM)"
"8. What are Support Vectors in SVM? A Support Vector Machine (SVM) is an algorithm that tries to fit a line (or plane or hyperplane) between the diﬀerent classes that maximizes the distance from the line to the points of the classes. In this way, it tries to find a robust separation between the classes. The Support Vectors are the points of the edge of the dividing hyperplane as in the below figure. Machine Learning Interview Questions Support Vector Machine (SVM)"
9. What are Diﬀerent Kernels in SVM? There are six types of kernels in SVM: Linear kernel - used when data is linearly separable. Polynomial kernel - When you have discrete data that has no natural notion of smoothness. Radial basis kernel - Create a decision boundary able to do a much better job of separating two classes than the linear kernel. Sigmoid kernel - used as an activation function for neural networks.
"10. What is Cross-Validation? Cross-validation is a method of splitting all your data into three parts: training, testing, and validation data. Data is split into k subsets, and the model has trained on k-1of those datasets. The last subset is held for testing. This is done for each of the subsets. This is k-fold cross-validation. Finally, the scores from all the k-folds are averaged to produce the final score. Machine Learning Interview Questions Cross-validation"
"11. What is Bias in Machine Learning? Bias in data tells us there is inconsistency in data. The inconsistency may occur for several reasons which are not mutually exclusive. For example, a tech giant like Amazon to speed the hiring process they build one engine where they are going to give 100 resumes, it will spit out the top five, and hire those. When the company realized the so"
"12. Explain the Diﬀerence Between Classification and Regression? Classification is used to produce discrete results, classification is used to classify data into some specific categories. For example, classifying emails into spam and non-spam categories. Whereas, regression deals with continuous data. For example, predicting stock prices at a certain point in time. Machine Learning Interview Questions Classification is used to predict the output into a group of classes. For example, Is it Hot or Cold tomorrow? Whereas, regression is used to predict the relationship that data represents. For example, What is the temperature tomorrow? Advanced Machine Learning Questions"
"13. What is F1 score? How would you use it? Let’s have a look at this table before directly jumping into the F1 score. Prediction Predicted Yes Predicted No Actual Yes True Positive (TP) False Negative (FN) Actual No False Positive (FP) True Negative (TN) In binary classification we consider the F1 score to be a measure of the model’s accuracy. The F1 score is a weighted average of precision and recall scores. F1 = 2TP/2TP + FP + FN We see scores for F1 between 0 and 1, where 0 is the worst score and 1 is the best score. The F1 score is typically used in information retrieval to see how well a model retrieves relevant results and our model is performing."
14. Define Precision and Recall? Precision and recall are ways of monitoring the power of machine learning implementation. But they o
"15. How to Tackle Overfitting and Underfitting? Overfitting means the model fitted to training data too well, in this case, we need to resample the data and estimate the model accuracy using techniques like k-fold cross-validation. Machine Learning Interview Questions Whereas for the Underfitting case we are not able to understand or capture the patterns from the data, in this case, we need to change the algorithms, or we need to feed more data points to the model."
"16. What is a Neural Network? It is a simplified model of the human brain. Much like the brain, it has neurons that activate when encountering something similar. The diﬀerent neurons are connected via connections that help information flow from one neuron to another."
"17. What are Loss Function and Cost Functions? Explain the key Diﬀerence Between them? When calculating loss we consider only a single data point, then we use the term loss function. Whereas, when calculating the sum of error for multiple data then we use the cost function. There is no major diﬀerence. In other words, the loss function is to capture the diﬀerence between the actual and predicted values for a single record whereas cost functions aggregate the diﬀerence for the entire training dataset. The Most commonly used loss functions are Mean-squared error and Hinge loss. Mean-Squared Error(MSE): In simple words, we can say how our model predicted values against the actual values. MSE = √(predicted value - actual value)2 Hinge loss: It is used to train the machine learning classifier, which is L(y) = max(0,1- yy) Where y = -1 or 1 indicating two classes and y represents the output form of the classifier. The most common cost function represents the total cost as the sum of the fixed costs and the variable costs in the equation y = mx + b"
"18. What is Ensemble learning? Machine Learning Interview Questions Ensemble learning is a method that combines multiple machine learning models to create more powerful models. There are many reasons for a model to be diﬀerent. Few reasons are: Diﬀerent Population Diﬀerent Hypothesis Diﬀerent modeling techniques When working with the model’s training and testing data, we will experience an error. This error might be bias, variance, and irreducible error. Now the model should always have a balance between bias and variance, which we call a bias-variance trade-oﬀ. This ensemble learning is a way to perform this trade-oﬀ. There are many ensemble techniques available but when aggregating multiple models there are two general methods: Bagging, a native method: take the training set and generate new training sets oﬀ of it. Boosting, a more elegant method: similar to bagging, boosting is used to optimize the best weighting scheme for a training set."
"19. How do you make sure which Machine Learning Algorithm to use? It completely depends on the dataset we have. If the data is discrete we use SVM. If the dataset is continuous we use linear regression. So there is no specific way that lets us know which ML algorithm to use, it all depends on the exploratory data analysis (EDA). EDA is like “interviewing” the dataset; As part of our interview we do the following: Classify our variables as continuous, categorical, and so forth. Summarize our variables using descriptive statistics. Visualize our variables using charts. Machine Learning Interview Questions Based on the above observations select one best-fit algorithm for a particular dataset."
"20. How to Handle Outlier Values? An Outlier is an observation in the dataset that is far away from other observations in the dataset. Tools used to discover outliers are Box plot Z-score Scatter plot, etc. Typically, we need to follow three simple strategies to handle outliers: We can drop them. We can mark them as outliers and include them as a feature. Likewise, we can transform the feature to reduce the eﬀect of the outlier."
"21. What is a Random Forest? How does it work? Random forest is a versatile machine learning method capable of performing both regression and classification tasks. Like bagging and boosting, random forest works by combining a set of other tree models. Random forest builds a tree from a random sample of the columns in the test data. Here’s are the steps how a random forest creates the trees: Take a sample size from the training data. Begin with a single node. Run the following algorithm, from the start node: If the number of observations is less than node size then stop. Select random variables. Find the variable that does the “best” job splitting the observations. Split the observations into two nodes. Call step `a` on each of these nodes. Machine Learning Interview Questions"
22. What is Collaborative Filtering? And Content-Based Filtering? Collaborative filtering is a proven technique for personalized content recommendations. Collaborative filtering is a type of recommendation system that predicts new content by matching the interests of the individual user with the preferences of many users. Content-based recommender systems are focused only on the preferences of the user. New recommendations are made to the user from similar content according to the user’s previous choices. Collaborative Filtering and Content-Based Filtering
"23. What is Clustering? Clustering is the process of grouping a set of objects into a number of groups. Objects should be similar to one another within the same cluster and dissimilar to those in other clusters. A few types of clustering are: Hierarchical clustering K means clustering Density-based clustering Fuzzy clustering, etc. Machine Learning Interview Questions A recommendation engine is a system used to predict users’ interests and recommend products that are quite likely interesting for them. Data required for recommender systems stems from explicit user ratings a"
"26. How do check the Normality of a dataset? Visually, we can use plots. A few of the normality checks are as follows: Shapiro-Wilk W Test Anderson-Darling Test Martinez-Iglewicz Test Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test D’Agostino Skewness Test"
"27. Can logistic regression use for more than 2 classes? No, logistic regression is a binary classifier, so it cannot be applied to more than 2 classes. For multi-class classification, we can use decision tree algorithms, Naive Bayes algorithms are well suited."
"28. Explain Correlation and Covariance? Correlation is used for measuring and also for estimating the quantitative relationship between two variables. Correlation measures how strongly two variables are related. Examples like, income and expenditure, demand and supply, etc. Covariance is a simple way to measure the correlation between two variables. The problem with covariance is that they are hard to compare without normalization."
"29. What is P-value? P-values are used to make a decision about a hypothesis test. P-value is the minimum significant level at which you can reject the null hypothesis. The lower the p-value, the more likely you reject the null hypothesis."
"30. What are Parametric and Non-Parametric Models? Machine Learning Interview Questions Parametric models will have limited parameters and to predict new data, you only need to know the parameter of the model. Non-Parametric models have no limits in taking a number of parameters, allowing for more flexibility and to predict new data. You need to know the state of the data and model parameters."
"31. What is Reinforcement Learning? Reinforcement learning is diﬀerent from the other types of learning like supervised and unsupervised. In reinforcement learning, we are given neither data nor labels. Our learning is based on the rewards given to the agent by the environment."
"Java Interview Questions Go through all the questions to enhance your chances of performing well in the interviews. The questions will revolve around the basic, core & advanced fundamentals of Java. So, let’s dive deep into the plethora of useful Java Interview questions and answers for freshers and experienced candidates in depth. Java Basic Interview Questions"
1. Why is Java a platform independent language? Java language was developed in such a way that it does not depend on any hardware or so
"2. Why is Java not a pure object oriented language? Java supports primitive data types - byte, boolean, char, short, int, float, long, and double and hence it is not a pure object oriented language."
"3. Diﬀerence between Heap and Stack Memory in java. And how java utilizes this. Stack memory is the portion of memory that was assigned to every individual program. And it was fixed. On the other hand, Heap memory is the portion that was not allocated to the java program but it will be available for use by the java program when it is required, mostly during the runtime of the program. Java Utilizes this memory as - When we write a java program then all the variables, methods, etc are stored in the stack memory. And when we create any object in the java program then that object was created in the heap memory. And it was referenced from the stack memory. Example- Consider the below java program: Java Interview Questions class Main { public void printArray(int[] array){ for(int i : array) System.out.println(i); } public static void main(String args[]) { int[] array = new int[10]; printArray(array); } } For this java program. The stack and heap memory occupied by java is - Main and PrintArray is the method that will be available in the stack area and as well as the variables declared that will also be in the stack area. And the Object (Integer Array of size 10) we have created, will be available in the Heap area because that space will be allocated to the program during runtime."
"4. Can java be said to be the complete object-oriented programming language? Java Interview Questions It is not wrong if we claim that java is the complete object-oriented programming language. Because Everything in Java is under the classes. And we can access that by creating the objects. But also if we say that java is not a completely object-oriented programming language because it has the support of primitive data types like int, float, char, boolean, double, etc. Now for the question: Is java a completely object-oriented programming language? We can say that - Java is not a pure object-oriented programming language, because it has direct access to primitive data types. And these primitive data types don't directly belong to the Integer classes."
"5. How is Java diﬀerent from C++? C++ is only a compiled language, whereas Java is compiled as well as an interpreted language. Java programs are machine-independent whereas a c++ program can run only in the machine in which it is compiled. C++ allows users to use pointers in the program. Whereas java doesn’t allow it. Java internally uses pointers. C++ supports the concept of Multiple inheritances whereas Java doesn't support this. And it is due to avoiding the complexity of name ambiguity that causes the diamond problem."
"6. Pointers are used in C/ C++. Why does Java not make use of pointers? Pointers are quite complicated and unsafe to use by beginner programmers. Java focuses on code simplicity, and the usage of pointers can make it challenging. Pointer utilization can also cause potential errors. Moreover, security is also compromised if pointers are used because the users can directly access memory with the help of pointers. Java Interview Questions Thus, a certain level of abstraction is furnished by not including pointers in Java. Moreover, the usage of pointers can make the procedure of garbage collection quite slow and erroneous. Java makes use of references as these cannot be manipulated, unlike pointers."
"7. What do you understand by an instance variable and a local variable? Instance variables are those variables that are accessible by all the methods in the class. They are declared outside the methods and inside the class. These variables describe the properties of an object and remain bound to it at any cost. All the objects of the class will have their copy of the variables for utilization. If any modification is done on these variables, then only that instance will be impacted by it, and all other class instances continue to remain unaﬀected. Example: class Athlete { public String athleteName; public double athleteSpeed; public int athleteAge; } Local variables are those variables present within a block, function, or constructor and can be accessed only inside them. The utilization of the variable is restricted to the block scope. Whenever a local variable is declared inside a method, the other class methods don’t have any knowledge about the local variable. Example: public void athlete() { String athleteName; double athleteSpeed; int athleteAge; } Java Interview Questions"
"8. What are the default values assigned to variables and instances in java? There are no default values assigned to the variables in java. We need to initialize the value before using it. Otherwise, it will throw a compilation error of (Variable might not be initialized). But for instance, if we create the object, then the default value will be initialized by the default constructor depending on the data type. If it is a reference, then it will be assigned to null. If it is numeric, then it will assign to 0. If it is a boolean, then it will be assigned to false. Etc."
9. What do you mean by data encapsulation? Java Interview Questions Data Encapsulation is an Object-Oriented Programming concept of hiding the data attributes and their behaviours in a single unit. It helps developers to follow modularity while developing so
"10. Tell us something about JIT compiler. Java Interview Questions JIT stands for Just-In-Time and it is used for improving the performance during run time. It does the task of compiling parts of byte code having similar functionality at the same time thereby reducing the amount of compilation time for the code to run. The compiler is nothing but a translator of source code to machine-executable code. But what is special about the JIT compiler? Let us see how it works: First, the Java source code (.java) conversion to byte code (.class) occurs with the help of the javac compiler. Then, the .class files are loaded at run time by JVM and with the help of an interpreter, these are converted to machine understandable code. JIT compiler is a part of JVM. When the JIT compiler is enabled, the JVM analyzes the method calls in the .class files and compiles them to get more eﬀicient and native code. It also ensures that the prioritized method calls are optimized. Once the above step is done, the JVM executes the optimized code directly instead of interpreting the code again. This increases the performance and speed of the execution. Java Interview Questions"
"11. Can you tell the diﬀerence between equals() method and equality operator (==) in Java? equals() == This is a method defined in the Object class. It is a binary operator in Java. This method is used for checking the equality of contents between two objects as per the specified business logic.This operator is used for comparing addresses (or references), i.e checks if both the objects are pointing to the same memory location. Note: In the cases where the equals method is not overridden in a class, then the class uses the default implementation of the equals method that is closest to the parent class. Object class is considered as the parent class of all the java classes. The implementation of the equals method in the Object class uses the == operator to compare two objects. This default implementation can be overridden as per the business logic."
12. How is an infinite loop declared in Java? Infinite loops are those loops that run infinitely without any breaking conditions. Some examples of consciously declaring infinite loop is: Using For Loop: Java Interview Questions for (;;) { // Business logic // Any break logic } Using while loop: while(true){ // Business logic // Any break logic } Using do-while loop: do{ // Business logic // Any break logic }while(true);
"13. Briefly explain the concept of constructor overloading Constructor overloading is the process of creating multiple constructors in the class consisting of the same name with a diﬀerence in the constructor parameters. Depending upon the number of parameters and their corresponding types, distinguishing of the diﬀerent types of constructors is done by the compiler. Java Interview Questions class Hospital { int variable1, variable2; double variable3; public Hospital(int doctors, int nurses) { variable1 = doctors; variable2 = nurses; } public Hospital(int doctors) { variable1 = doctors; } public Hospital(double salaries) { variable3 = salaries } } Three constructors are defined here but they diﬀer on the basis of parameter type and their numbers."
"14. Define Copy constructor in java. Copy Constructor is the constructor used when we want to initialize the value to the new object from the old object of the same class. Java Interview Questions class InterviewBit{ String department; String service; InterviewBit(InterviewBit ib){ this.departments = ib.departments; this.services = ib.services; } } Here we are initializing the new object value from the old object value in the constructor. Although, this can also be achieved with the help of object cloning."
"15. Can the main method be Overloaded? Yes, It is possible to overload the main method. We can create as many overloaded main methods we want. However, JVM has a predefined calling method that JVM will only call the main method with the definition of - public static void main(string[] args) Consider the below code snippets: class Main { public static void main(String args[]) { System.out.println("" Main Method""); } public static void main(int[] args){ System.out.println(""Overloaded Integer array Main Method""); } public static void main(char[] args){ System.out.println(""Overloaded Character array Main Method""); } public static int main(double[] args){ System.out.println(""Overloaded Double array Main Method""); } public static void main(float args){ System.out.println(""Overloaded float Main Method""); } } Java Interview Questions"
"16. Comment on method overloading and overriding by citing relevant examples. In Java, method overloading is made possible by introducing diﬀerent methods in the same class consisting of the same name. Still, all the functions diﬀer in the number or type of parameters. It takes place inside a class and enhances program readability. The only diﬀerence in the return type of the method does not promote method overloading. The following example will furnish you with a clear picture of it. class OverloadingHelp { public int findarea (int l, int b) { int var1; var1 = l * b; return var1; } public int findarea (int l, int b, int h) { int var2; var2 = l * b * h; return var2; } } Java Interview Questions Both the functions have the same name but diﬀer in the number of arguments. The first method calculates the area of the rectangle, whereas the second method calculates the area of a cuboid. Method overriding is the concept in which two methods having the same method signature are present in two diﬀerent classes in which an inheritance relationship is present. A particular method implementation (already present in the base class) is possible for the derived class by using method overriding. Let’s give a look at this example: class HumanBeing { public int walk (int distance, int time) { int speed = distance / time; return speed; } } class Athlete extends HumanBeing { public int walk(int distance, int time) { int speed = distance / time; speed = speed * 2; return speed; } } Java Interview Questions Both class methods have the name walk and the same parameters, distance, and time. If the derived class method is called, then the base class method walk gets overridden by that of the derived class."
"17. A single try block and multiple catch blocks can co-exist in a Java Program. Explain. Yes, multiple catch blocks can exist but specific approaches should come prior to the general approach because only the first catch block satisfying the catch condition is executed. The given code illustrates the same: public class MultipleCatch { public static void main(String args[]) { try { int n = 1000, x = 0; int arr[] = new int[n]; for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) { arr[i] = i / x; } } catch (ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException exception) { System.out.println(""1st block = ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException""); } catch (ArithmeticException exception) { System.out.println(""2nd block = ArithmeticException""); } catch (Exception exception) { System.out.println(""3rd block = Exception""); } } } Here, the second catch block will be executed because of division by 0 (i / x). In case x was greater than 0 then the first catch block will execute because for loop runs till i = n and array index are till n-1."
"18. Explain the use of final keyword in variable, method and class. In Java, the final keyword is used as defining something as constant /final and represents the non-access modifier. Java Interview Questions final variable: When a variable is declared as final in Java, the value can’t be modified once it has been assigned. If any value has not been assigned to that variable, then it can be assigned only by the constructor of the class. final method: A method declared as final cannot be overridden by its children's classes. A constructor cannot be marked as final because whenever a class is inherited, the constructors are not inherited. Hence, marking it final doesn't make sense. Java throws compilation error saying - modifier final not allowed here final class: No classes can be inherited from the class declared as final. But that final class can extend other classes for its usage."
"19. Do final, finally and finalize keywords have the same function? All three keywords have their own utility while programming. Final: If any restriction is required for classes, variables, or methods, the final keyword comes in handy. Inheritance of a final class and overriding of a final method is restricted by the use of the final keyword. The variable value becomes fixed a"
"20. Is it possible that the ‘finally’ block will not be executed? If yes then list the case. Yes. It is possible that the ‘finally’ block will not be executed. The cases are- Suppose we use System.exit() in the above statement. If there are fatal errors like Stack overflow, Memory access error, etc."
21. Identify the output of the java program and state the reason. Java Interview Questions
1. public class InterviewBit
2. {
3. public static void main(String[] args) {
4. final int i;
5. i = 20;
6. int j = i+20;
7. i = j+30;
"8. System.out.println(i + "" "" + j);"
9. }
"10. } The above code will generate a compile-time error at Line 7 saying - [error: variable i might already have been initialized]. It is because variable ‘i’ is the final variable. And final variables are allowed to be initialized only once, and that was already done on line no 5."
22. When can you use super keyword? The super keyword is used to access hidden fields and overridden methods or attributes of the parent class. Following are the cases when this keyword can be used: Accessing data members of parent class when the member names of the class and its child subclasses are same. To call the default and parameterized constructor of the parent class inside the child class. Accessing the parent class methods when the child classes have overridden them. The following example demonstrates all 3 cases when a super keyword is used. Java Interview Questions
23. Can the static methods be overloaded? Yes! There can be two or more static methods in a class with the same name but diﬀering input parameters.
"24. Why is the main method static in Java? public class Parent{ protected int num = 1; Parent(){ System.out.println(""Parent class default constructor.""); } Parent(String x){ System.out.println(""Parent class parameterised constructor.""); } public void foo(){ System.out.println(""Parent class foo!""); } } public class Child extends Parent{ private int num = 2; Child(){ System.out.println(""Child class default Constructor""); super(); // to call default parent constructor super(""Call Parent""); // to call parameterised constructor. } void printNum(){ System.out.println(num); System.out.println(super.num); //prints the value of num of parent class } @Override public void foo(){ System.out.println(""Parent class foo!""); super.foo(); //Calls foo method of Parent class inside the Overriden foo } } Java Interview Questions The main method is always static because static members are those methods that belong to the classes, not to an individual object. So if the main method will not be static then for every object, It is available. And that is not acceptable by JVM. JVM calls the main method based on the class name itself. Not by creating the object. Because there must be only 1 main method in the java program as the execution starts from the main method. So for this reason the main method is static."
"25. Can the static methods be overridden? No! Declaration of static methods having the same signature can be done in the subclass but run time polymorphism can not take place in such cases. Overriding or dynamic polymorphism occurs during the runtime, but the static methods are loaded and looked up at the compile time statically. Hence, these methods cant be overridden."
"26. Diﬀerence between static methods, static variables, and static classes in java. Static Methods and Static variables are those methods and variables that belong to the class of the java program, not to the object of the class. This gets memory where the class is loaded. And these can directly be called with the help of class names. For example - We have used mathematical functions in the java program like - max(), min(), sqrt(), pow(), etc. And if we notice that, then we will find that we call it directly with the class name. Like - Math.max(), Math.min(), etc. So that is a static method. And Similarly static variables we have used like (length) for the array to get the length. So that is the static method. Static classes - A class in the java program cannot be static except if it is the inner class. If it is an inner static class, then it exactly works like other static members of the class."
"27. What is the main objective of garbage collection? Java Interview Questions The main objective of this process is to free up the memory space occupied by the unnecessary and unreachable objects during the Java program execution by deleting those unreachable objects. This ensures that the memory resource is used eﬀiciently, but it provides no guarantee that there would be suﬀicient memory for the program execution."
"28. What is a ClassLoader? Java Classloader is the program that belongs to JRE (Java Runtime Environment). The task of ClassLoader is to load the required classes and interfaces to the JVM when required. Example- To get input from the console, we require the scanner class. And the Scanner class is loaded by the ClassLoader."
29. What part of memory - Stack or Heap - is cleaned in garbage collection process? Heap.
"30. What are shallow copy and deep copy in java? To copy the object's data, we have several methods like deep copy and shallow copy. Example - class Rectangle{ int length = 5; int breadth = 3; } Object for this Rectangle class - Rectangle obj1 = new Rectangle(); Shallow copy - The shallow copy only creates a new reference and points to the same object. Example - For Shallow copy, we can do this by - Rectangle obj2 = obj1; Java Interview Questions Now by doing this what will happen is the new reference is created with the name obj2 and that will point to the same memory location. Deep Copy - In a deep copy, we create a new object and copy the old object value to the new object. Example - Rectangle obj3 = new Rectangle(); Obj3.length = obj1.length; Obj3.breadth = obj1.breadth; Both these objects will point to the memory location as stated below - Now, if we change the values in shallow copy then they aﬀect the other reference as well. Let's see with the help of an example - Java Interview Questions Output - Before Changing the value of object 1, the object2 will be - Object2 Length = 5, Object2 Breadth = 3 After Changing the value of object 1, the object2 will be - Object2 Length = 10, Object2 Breadth = 20 We can see that in the above code, if we change the values of object1, then the object2 values also get changed. It is because of the reference. Now, if we change the code to deep copy, then there will be no eﬀect on object2 if it is of type deep copy. Consider some snippets to be added in the above code. class Rectangle { int length = 5; int breadth = 3; } public class Main { public static void main(String[] args) { Rectangle obj1 = new Rectangle(); //Shallow Copy Rectangle obj2 = obj1; System.out.println("" Before Changing the value of object 1, the object2 will System.out.println("" Object2 Length = ""+obj2.length+"", Object2 Breadth = ""+o //Changing the values for object1. obj1.length = 10; obj1.breadth = 20; System.out.println(""\\n After Changing the value of object 1, the object2 wil System.out.println("" Object2 Length = ""+obj2.length+"", Object2 Breadth = ""+o } } Java Interview Questions The above snippet will not aﬀect the object2 values. It has its separate values. The output will be Before Changing the value of object 1, the object2 will be - Object2 Length = 5, Object2 Breadth = 3 After Changing the value of object 1, the object2 will be - Object2 Length = 5, Object2 Breadth = 3 Now we see that we need to write the number of codes for this deep copy. So to reduce this, In java, there is a method called clone(). The clone() will do this deep copy internally and return a new object. And to do this we need to write only 1 line of code. That is - Rectangle obj2 = obj1.clone(); Java Intermediate Interview Questions class Rectangle { int length = 5; int breadth = 3; } public class Main { public static void main(String[] args) { Rectangle obj1 = new Rectangle(); //Shallow Copy Rectangle obj2 = new Rectangle(); obj2.length = obj1.length; obj2.breadth = obj1.breadth; System.out.println("" Before Changing the value of object 1, the object2 will System.out.println("" Object2 Length = ""+obj2.length+"", Object2 Breadth = ""+o //Changing the values for object1. obj1.length = 10; obj1.breadth = 20; System.out.println(""\\n After Changing the value of object 1, the object2 wil System.out.println("" Object2 Length = ""+obj2.length+"", Object2 Breadth = ""+o } } Java Interview Questions"
"31. Apart from the security aspect, what are the reasons behind making strings immutable in Java? A String is made immutable due to the following reasons: String Pool: Designers of Java were aware of the fact that String data type is going to be majorly used by the programmers and developers. Thus, they wanted optimization from the beginning. They came up with the notion of using the String pool (a storage area in Java heap) to store the String literals. They intended to decrease the temporary String object with the help of sharing. An immutable class is needed to facilitate sharing. The sharing of the mutable structures between two unknown parties is not possible. Thus, immutable Java String helps in executing the concept of String Pool. Java Interview Questions Multithreading: The safety of threads regarding the String objects is an important aspect in Java. No external synchronization is required if the String objects are immutable. Thus, a cleaner code can be written for sharing the String objects across diﬀerent threads. The complex process of concurrency is facilitated by this method. Collections: In the case of Hashtables and HashMaps, keys are String objects. If the String objects are not immutable, then it can get modified during the period when it resides in the HashMaps. Consequently, the retrieval of the desired data is not possible. Such changing states pose a lot of risks. Therefore, it is quite safe to make the string immutable."
"32. What is a singleton class in Java? And How to implement a singleton class? Singleton classes are those classes, whose objects are created only once. And with only that object the class members can be accessed. Understand this with the help of an example-: Consider the water jug in the oﬀice and if every employee wants that water then they will not create a new water jug for drinking water. They will use the existing one with their own reference as a glass. So programmatically it should be implemented as - Java Interview Questions In the above class, the Constructor is private so we cannot create the object of the class. But we can get the object by calling the method getInstance(). And the getInstance is static so it can be called without creating the object. And it returns the object. Now with that object, we can call getWater() to get the water. Waterjug glass1 = WaterJug.getInstance(); glass1.getWater(1); We can get the single object using this getInstance(). And it is static, so it is a thread- safe singleton class. Although there are many ways to create a thread-safe singleton class. So thread-safe classes can also be: When singletons are written with double-checked locking, they can be thread- safe. We can use static singletons that are initialized during class loading. Like we did in the above example. But the most straightforward way to create a thread-safe singleton is to use Java enums. class WaterJug{ private int waterQuantity = 500; private WaterJug(){} private WaterJug object = null; // Method to provide the service of Giving Water. public int getWater(int quantity){ waterQuantity -= quantity; return quantity; } // Method to return the object to the user. public static Waterjug getInstance(){ // Will Create a new object if the object is not already created and return the if(object == null){ object = new WaterJug(); } return object; } } Java Interview Questions"
33. Which of the below generates a compile-time error? State the reason.
1. int[] n1 = new int[0];
2. boolean[] n2 = new boolean[-200];
3. double[] n3 = new double[2241423798];
"4. char[] ch = new char[20]; We get a compile-time error in line 3. The error we will get in Line 3 is - integer number too large. It is because the array requires size as an integer. And Integer takes 4 Bytes in the memory. And the number (2241423798) is beyond the capacity of the integer. The maximum array size we can declare is - (2147483647). Because the array requires the size in integer, none of the lines (1, 2, and 4) will give a compile-time error. The program will compile fine. But we get the runtime exception in line 2. The exception is - NegativeArraySizeException. Here what will happen is - At the time when JVM will allocate the required memory during runtime then it will find that the size is negative. And the array size can’t be negative. So the JVM will throw the exception."
"34. How would you diﬀerentiate between a String, StringBuﬀer, and a StringBuilder? Java Interview Questions Storage area: In string, the String pool serves as the storage area. For StringBuilder and StringBuﬀer, heap memory is the storage area. Mutability: A String is immutable, whereas both the StringBuilder and StringBuﬀer are mutable. Eﬀiciency: It is quite slow to work with a String. However, StringBuilder is the fastest in performing operations. The speed of a StringBuﬀer is more than a String and less than a StringBuilder. (For example appending a character is fastest in StringBuilder and very slow in String because a new memory is required for the new String with appended character.) Thread-safe: In the case of a threaded environment, StringBuilder and StringBuﬀer are used whereas a String is not used. However, StringBuilder is suitable for an environment with a single thread, and a StringBuﬀer is suitable for multiple threads. Syntax: // String String first = ""InterviewBit""; String second = new String(""InterviewBit""); // StringBuffer StringBuffer third = new StringBuffer(""InterviewBit""); // StringBuilder StringBuilder fourth = new StringBuilder(""InterviewBit"");"
"35. Using relevant properties highlight the diﬀerences between interfaces and abstract classes. Java Interview Questions Availability of methods: Only abstract methods are available in interfaces, whereas non-abstract methods can be present along with abstract methods in abstract classes. Variable types: Static and final variables can only be declared in the case of interfaces, whereas abstract classes can also have non-static and non-final variables. Inheritance: Multiple inheritances are facilitated by interfaces, whereas abstract classes do not promote multiple inheritances. Data member accessibility: By default, the class data members of interfaces are of the public- type. Conversely, the class members for an abstract class can be protected or private also. Implementation: With the help of an abstract class, the implementation of an interface is easily possible. However, the converse is not true; Abstract class example: public abstract class Athlete { public abstract void walk(); } Interface example: public interface Walkable { void walk(); }"
36. Is this program giving a compile-time error? If Yes then state the reason and number of errors it will give. If not then state the reason. Java Interview Questions abstract final class InterviewBit{
2. public abstract void printMessage();
3. }
4. class ScalarAcademy extends InterviewBit{
5. public void printMessage(){
"6. System.out.println(""Welcome to Scalar Academy By InterviewBit"");"
7. }
8. }
9. class ScalarTopics extends ScalarAcademy{
10. public void printMessage(){
"11. System.out.println(""Welcome to Scalar Topics By Scalar Academy"");"
12. }
"13. } public class Main{ public static void main(String[] args) { InterviewBit ib = new ScalarTopics(); ib.printMessage(); } } The above program will give a compile-time error. The compiler will throw 2 errors in this. [Illegal Combination of modifiers: abstract and final] at line 1. [Cannot inherit from final ‘InterviewBit’] at line 4. It is because abstract classes are incomplete classes that need to be inherited for making their concrete classes. And on the other hand, the final keywords in class are used for avoiding inheritance. So these combinations are not allowed in java."
"37. What is a Comparator in java? Consider the example where we have an ArrayList of employees like( EId, Ename, Salary), etc. Now if we want to sort this list of employees based on the names of employees. Then that is not possible to sort using the Collections.sort() method. We need to provide something to the sort() function depending on what values we have to perform sorting. Then in that case a comparator is used. Comparator is the interface in java that contains the compare method. And by overloading the compare method, we can define that on what basis we need to compare the values. Java Interview Questions"
"38. In Java, static as well as private method overriding is possible. Comment on the statement. The statement in the context is completely False. The static methods have no relevance with the objects, and these methods are of the class level. In the case of a child class, a static method with a method signature exactly like that of the parent class can exist without even throwing any compilation error. The phenomenon mentioned here is popularly known as method hiding, and overriding is certainly not possible. Private method overriding is unimaginable because the visibility of the private method is restricted to the parent class only. As a result, only hiding can be facilitated and not overriding."
"39. What makes a HashSet diﬀerent from a TreeSet? Although both HashSet and TreeSet are not synchronized and ensure that duplicates are not present, there are certain properties that distinguish a HashSet from a TreeSet. Implementation: For a HashSet, the hash table is utilized for storing the elements in an unordered manner. However, TreeSet makes use of the red-black tree to store the elements in a sorted manner. Complexity/ Performance: For adding, retrieving, and deleting elements, the time amortized complexity is O(1) for a HashSet. The time complexity for performing the same operations is a bit higher for TreeSet and is equal to O(log n). Overall, the performance of HashSet is faster in comparison to TreeSet. Methods: hashCode() and equals() are the methods utilized by HashSet for making comparisons between the objects. Conversely, compareTo() and compare() methods are utilized by TreeSet to facilitate object comparisons. Objects type: Heterogeneous and null objects can be stored with the help of HashSet. In the case of a TreeSet, runtime exception occurs while inserting heterogeneous objects or null objects."

"41. What do we get in the JDK file? JDK- For making java programs, we need some tools that are provided by JDK (Java Development Kit). JDK is the package that contains various tools, Compiler, Java Runtime Environment, etc. JRE - To execute the java program we need an environment. (Java Runtime Environment) JRE contains a library of Java classes + JVM. What are JAVA Classes? It contains some predefined methods that help Java programs to use that feature, build and execute. For example - there is a system class in java that contains the print-stream method, and with the help of this, we can print something on the console. JVM - (Java Virtual Machine) JVM is a part of JRE that executes the Java program at the end. Actually, it is part of JRE, but it is so"

43. What are the diﬀerences between HashMap and HashTable in Java? HashMap HashTable HashMap is not synchronized thereby making it better for non-threaded applications.HashTable is synchronized and hence it is suitable for threaded applications. Allows only one null key but any number of null in the values.This does not allow null in both keys or values. Supports order of insertion by making use of its subclass LinkedHashMap.Order of insertion is not guaranteed in HashTable.
"44. What is the importance of reflection in Java? The term reflection is used for describing the inspection capability of a code on other code either of itself or of its system and modify it during runtime. Consider an example where we have an object of unknown type and we have a method ‘fooBar()’ which we need to call on the object. The static typing system of Java doesn't allow this method invocation unless the type of the object is known beforehand. This can be achieved using reflection which allows the code to scan the object and identify if it has any method called “fooBar()” and only then call the method if needed. Method methodOfFoo = fooObject.getClass().getMethod(""fooBar"", null); methodOfFoo.invoke(fooObject, null); Java Interview Questions Using reflection has its own cons: Speed — M ethod invocations due to reflection are about three times slower than the direct method calls. Type safety — W hen a method is invoked via its reference wrongly using reflection, invocation fails at runtime as it is not detected at compile/load time. Traceability — W henever a reflective method fails, it is very diﬀicult to find the root cause of this failure due to a huge stack trace. One has to deep dive into the invoke() and proxy() method logs to identify the root cause. Hence, it is advisable to follow solutions that don't involve reflection and use this method as a last resort."
"45. What are the diﬀerent ways of threads usage? We can define and implement a thread in java using two ways: Extending the Thread class class InterviewBitThreadExample extends Thread{ public void run(){ System.out.println(""Thread runs...""); } public static void main(String args[]){ InterviewBitThreadExample ib = new InterviewBitThreadExample(); ib.start(); } } Implementing the Runnable interface class InterviewBitThreadExample implements Runnable{ public void run(){ System.out.println(""Thread runs...""); } public static void main(String args[]){ Thread ib = new Thread(new InterviewBitThreadExample()); ib.start(); } } Java Interview Questions Implementing a thread using the method of Runnable interface is more preferred and advantageous as Java does not have support for multiple inheritances of classes. start() method is used for creating a separate call stack for the thread execution. Once the call stack is created, JVM calls the run() method for executing the thread in that call stack."
"46. What are the diﬀerent types of Thread Priorities in Java? And what is the default priority of a thread assigned by JVM? There are a total of 3 diﬀerent types of priority available in Java. MIN_PRIORITY: It has an integer value assigned with 1. MAX_PRIORITY: It has an integer value assigned with 10. NORM_PRIORITY: It has an integer value assigned with 5. In Java, Thread with MAX_PRIORITY gets the first chance to execute. But the default priority for any thread is NORM_PRIORITY assigned by JVM."
"47. What is the diﬀerence between the program and the process? A program can be defined as a line of code written in order to accomplish a particular task. Whereas the process can be defined as the programs which are under execution. A program doesn't execute directly by the CPU. First, the resources are allocated to the program and when it is ready for execution then it is a process."
"48. What is the diﬀerence between the ‘throw’ and ‘throws’ keyword in java? The ‘throw’ keyword is used to manually throw the exception to the calling method. And the ‘throws’ keyword is used in the function definition to inform the calling method that this method throws the exception. So if you are calling, then you have to handle the exception. Java Interview Questions Example - class Main { public static int testExceptionDivide(int a, int b) throws ArithmeticException{ if(a == 0 || b == 0) throw new ArithmeticException(); return a/b; } public static void main(String args[]) { try{ testExceptionDivide(10, 0); } catch(ArithmeticException e){ //Handle the exception } } } Here in the above snippet, the method testExceptionDivide throws an exception. So if the main method is calling it then it must have handled the exception. Otherwise, the main method can also throw the exception to JVM. And the method testExceptionDivide 'throws’ the exception based on the condition."
"49. What are the diﬀerences between constructor and method of a class in Java? Java Interview Questions Constructor Method Constructor is used for initializing the object state.Method is used for exposing the object's behavior. Constructor has no return type.Method should have a return type. Even if it does not return anything, return type is void. Constructor gets invoked implicitly.Method has to be invoked on the object explicitly. If the constructor is not defined, then a default constructor is provided by the java compiler.If a method is not defined, then the compiler does not provide it. The constructor name should be equal to the class name.The name of the method can have any name or have a class name too. A constructor cannot be marked as final because whenever a class is inherited, the constructors are not inherited. Hence, marking it final doesn't make sense. Java throws compilation error saying - modifier final not allowed hereA method can be defined as final but it cannot be overridden in its subclasses. Java Interview Questions"
"50. Identify the output of the below java program and Justify your answer. class Main { public static void main(String args[]) { Scaler s = new Scaler(5); } } class InterviewBit{ InterviewBit(){ System.out.println("" Welcome to InterviewBit ""); } } class Scaler extends InterviewBit{ Scaler(){ System.out.println("" Welcome to Scaler Academy ""); } Scaler(int x){ this(); super(); System.out.println("" Welcome to Scaler Academy 2""); } } The above code will throw the compilation error. It is because the super() is used to call the parent class constructor. But there is the condition that super() must be the first statement in the block. Now in this case, if we replace this() with super() then also it will throw the compilation error. Because this() also has to be the first statement in the block. So in conclusion, we can say that we cannot use this() and super() keywords in the same block."
"51. Java works as “pass by value” or “pass by reference” phenomenon? Java always works as a “pass by value”. There is nothing called a “pass by reference” in Java. However, when the object is passed in any method, the address of the value is passed due to the nature of object handling in Java. When an object is passed, a copy of the reference is created by Java and that is passed to the method. The objects point to the same memory location. 2 cases might happen inside the method: Java Interview Questions Case 1: When the object is pointed to another location: In this case, the changes made to that object do not get reflected the original object before it was passed to the method as the reference points to another location. For example: Case 2: When object references are not modified: In this case, since we have the copy of reference the main object pointing to the same memory location, any changes in the content of the object get reflected in the original object. For example: class InterviewBitTest{ int num; InterviewBitTest(int x){ num = x; } InterviewBitTest(){ num = 0; } } class Driver { public static void main(String[] args) { //create a reference InterviewBitTest ibTestObj = new InterviewBitTest(20); //Pass the reference to updateObject Method updateObject(ibTestObj); //After the updateObject is executed, check for the value of num in the object. System.out.println(ibTestObj.num); } public static void updateObject(InterviewBitTest ibObj) { // Point the object to new reference ibObj = new InterviewBitTest(); // Update the value ibObj.num = 50; } } Output: 20 Java Interview Questions"
"52. What is the ‘IS-A ‘ relationship in OOPs java? ‘IS-A’ relationship is another name for inheritance. When we inherit the base class from the derived class, then it forms a relationship between the classes. So that relationship is termed an ‘IS-A’ Relationship. Example - Consider a Television (Typical CRT TV). Now another Smart TV that is inherited from television class. So we can say that the Smart iv is also a TV. Because CRT TV things can also be done in the Smart TV. class InterviewBitTest{ int num; InterviewBitTest(int x){ num = x; } InterviewBitTest(){ num = 0; } } class Driver{ public static void main(String[] args) { //create a reference InterviewBitTest ibTestObj = new InterviewBitTest(20); //Pass the reference to updateObject Method updateObject(ibTestObj); //After the updateObject is executed, check for the value of num in the object. System.out.println(ibTestObj.num); } public static void updateObject(InterviewBitTest ibObj) { // no changes are made to point the ibObj to new location // Update the value of num ibObj.num = 50; } } Output: 50 Java Interview Questions So here ‘IS-A’ Relationship formed. [ SmartTV ‘IS-A’ TV ]."
"53. Which among String or String Buﬀer should be preferred when there are lot of updates required to be done in the data? StringBuﬀer is mutable and dynamic in nature whereas String is immutable. Every updation / m odification of String creates a new String thereby overloading the string pool with unnecessary objects. Hence, in the cases of a lot of updates, it is always preferred to use StringBuﬀer as it will reduce the overhead of the creation of multiple String objects in the string pool."
"54. How to not allow serialization of attributes of a class in Java? In order to achieve this, the attribute can be declared along with the usage of transient keyword as shown below: Java Interview Questions public class InterviewBitExample { private transient String someInfo; private String name; private int id; // : // Getters setters // : } In the above example, all the fields except someInfo can be serialized."
"55. What happens if the static modifier is not included in the main method signature in Java? There wouldn't be any compilation error. But then the program is run, since the JVM cant map the main method signature, the code throws “NoSuchMethodError” error at the runtime."
"56. Consider the below program, identify the output, and also state the reason for that. public class Main{ public static void main(String[] args) { System.out.println("" Hello. Main Method. ""); } public static void main(int[] args) { System.out.println("" Hello. Main Method2. ""); } } The output of the above program will be Hello. Main Method. This is because JVM will always call the main method based on the definition it already has. Doesn't matter how many main methods we overload it will only execute one main method based on its declaration in JVM."
"57. Can we make the main() thread a daemon thread? Java Interview Questions In java multithreading, the main() threads are always non-daemon threads. And there is no way we can change the nature of the non-daemon thread to the daemon thread."
58. What happens if there are multiple main methods inside one class in Java? The program can't compile as the compiler says that the method has been already defined inside the class.
"59. What do you understand by Object Cloning and how do you achieve it in Java? It is the process of creating an exact copy of any object. In order to support this, a java class has to implement the Cloneable interface of java.lang package and override the clone() method provided by the Object class the syntax of which is: protected Object clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException{ return (Object)super.clone(); } In case the Cloneable interface is not implemented and just the method is overridden, it results in CloneNotSupportedException in Java."
"60. How does an exception propagate in the code? When an exception occurs, first it searches to locate the matching catch block. In case, the matching catch block is located, then that block would be executed. Else, the exception propagates through the method call stack and goes into the caller method where the process of matching the catch block is performed. This propagation happens until the matching catch block is found. If the match is not found, then the program gets terminated in the main method. Java Interview Questions"
61. How do exceptions aﬀect the program if it doesn't handle them? Exceptions are runtime errors. Suppose we are making an android application with java. And it all works fine but there is an exceptional case when the application tries to get the file from storage and the file doesn’t exist (This is the case of exception in java). And if this case is not handled properly then the application will crash. This will be a bad experience for users. This is the type of error that cannot be controlled by the programmer. But programmers can take some steps to avoid this so that the application won’t crash. The proper action can be taken at this step.
62. Is it mandatory for a catch block to be followed a
63. Will the finally block get executed when the return statement is written at the end of try block and catch block as shown below? public int someMethod(int i){ try{ //some statement return 1; }catch(Exception e){ //some statement return 999; }finally{ //finally block statements } } finally block will be executed irrespective of the exception or not. The only case where finally block is not executed is when it encounters ‘System.exit()’ method anywhere in try/catch block.
"64. Can you call a constructor of a class inside the another constructor? Yes, the concept can be termed as constructor chaining and can be achieved using this(). Java Interview Questions"
"65. Contiguous memory locations are usually used for storing actual values in an array but not in ArrayList. Explain. In the case of ArrayList, data storing in the form of primitive data types (like int, float, etc.) is not possible. The data members/objects present in the ArrayList have references to the objects which are located at various sites in the memory. Thus, storing of actual objects or non-primitive data types (like Integer, Double, etc.) takes place in various memory locations. Java Interview Questions However, the same does not apply to the arrays. Object or primitive type values can be stored in arrays in contiguous memory locations, hence every element does not require any reference to the next element."
"66. Why does the java array index start with 0? Java Interview Questions It is because the 0 index array avoids the extra arithmetic operation to calculate the memory address. Example - Consider the array and assume each element takes 4-byte memory space. Then the address will be like this - Now if we want to access index 4. Then internally java calculates the address using the formula- [Base Address + (index * no_of_bytes)]. So according to this. The starting address of the index 4 will be - [100 + (4*4)] = 116. And exactly that's what the address is calculated. Now consider the same with 1 index Array - Java Interview Questions Now if we apply the same formula here. Then we get - 116 as the starting address of the 4th index. Which is wrong. Then we need to apply formula - [Base Address + ((index-1) * no_of_bytes)]. And for calculating this, an extra arithmetic operation has to be performed. And consider the case where millions of addresses need to be calculated, this causes complexity. So to avoid this, ) the index array is supported by java."
"67. Why is the remove method faster in the linked list than in an array? In the linked list, we only need to adjust the references when we want to delete the element from either end or the front of the linked list. But in the array, indexes are used. So to manage proper indexing, we need to adjust the values from the array So this adjustment of value is costlier than the adjustment of references. Example - To Delete from the front of the linked list, internally the references adjustments happened like this. The only thing that will change is that the head pointer will point to the head’s next node. And delete the previous node. That is the constant time operation. Java Interview Questions Whereas in the ArrayList, internally it should work like this- For deletion of the first element, all the next element has to move to one place ahead. So this copying value takes time. So that is the reason why removing in ArrayList is slower than LinkedList."
"68. How many overloaded add() and addAll() methods are available in the List interface? Describe the need and uses. There are a total of 4 overloaded methods for add() and addAll() methods available in List Interface. The below table states the description of all. Java Interview Questions Return Type Method Description boolean add(Element e): This method is used for adding the element at the end of the List. The Datatype of the element is of any type it has been initially assigned with. It returns the boolean indicating successfully inserted or not. void add(int index, Element e): This method is the overloaded version of add() method. In this, along with the element, the index is also passed to the method for the specific index the value needs to be inserted. boolean addAll(Collection <extends ? Element > c): This method helps to add all elements at the end of collections from the list received in the parameter. It contains an iterator that helps to iterate the list and add the elements to the collection. boolean addAll(int index, Collection <extends ? Element > c): This is the overloaded method for addAll() method. In this along with the list, we can pass the specified index from which the list elements need to be added."
"69. How does the size of ArrayList grow dynamically? And also state how it is implemented internally. Java Interview Questions ArrayList is implemented in such a way that it can grow dynamically. We don't need to specify the size of ArrayList. For adding the values in it, the methodology it uses is -"
"1. Consider initially that there are 2 elements in the ArrayList. [2, 3]."
"2. If we need to add the element into this. Then internally what will happen is- ArrayList will allocate the new ArrayList of Size (current size + half of the current size). And add the old elements into the new. Old - [2, 3], New - [2, 3, null, null]. Java Interview Questions Then the new value will be inserted into it. [2, 3, 4, null]. And for the next time, the extra space will be available for the value to be inserted."
3. This process continues and the time taken to perform all of these is considered as the amortized constant time. This is how the ArrayList grows dynamically. And when we delete any entry from the ArrayList then the following steps are performed -
1. It searches for the element index in the array. Searching takes some time. Typically it’s O(n) because it needs to search for the element in the entire array. Java Interview Questions

"70. Although inheritance is a popular OOPs concept, it is less advantageous than composition. Explain. Inheritance lags behind composition in the following scenarios: Java Interview Questions Multiple-inheritance is not possible in Java. Classes can only extend from one superclass. In cases where multiple functionalities are required, for example - to read and write information into the file, the pattern of composition is preferred. The writer, as well as reader functionalities, can be made use of by considering them as the private members. Composition assists in attaining high flexibility and prevents breaking of encapsulation. Unit testing is possible with composition and not inheritance. When a developer wants to test a class composing a diﬀerent class, then Mock Object can be created for signifying the composed class to facilitate testing. This technique is not possible with the help of inheritance as the derived class cannot be tested without the help of the superclass in inheritance. The loosely coupled nature of composition is preferable over the tightly coupled nature of inheritance. Let’s take an example: package comparison; public class Top { public int start() { return 0; } } class Bottom extends Top { public int stop() { return 0; } } In the above example, inheritance is followed. Now, some modifications are done to the Top class like this: Java Interview Questions public class Top { public int start() { return 0; } public void stop() { } } If the new implementation of the Top class is followed, a compile-time error is bound to occur in the Bottom class. Incompatible return type is there for the Top.stop() function. Changes have to be made to either the Top or the Bottom class to ensure compatibility. However, the composition technique can be utilized to solve the given problem: class Bottom { Top par = new Top(); public int stop() { par.start(); par.stop(); return 0; } }"

"72. What are Composition and Aggregation? State the diﬀerence. Composition, and Aggregation help to build (Has - A - Relationship) between classes and objects. But both are not the same in the end. Let’s understand with the help of an example. Consider the University as a class that has some departments in it. So the university will be the container object. And departments in it will contain objects. Now in this case, if the container object destroys then the contained objects will also get destroyed automatically. So here we can say that there is a strong association between the objects. So this Strong Association is called Composition. Now consider one more example. Suppose we have a class department and there are several professors' objects there in the department. Now if the department class is destroyed then the professor's object will become free to bind with other objects. Because container objects (Department) only hold the references of contained objects (Professor’s). So here is the weak association between the objects. And this weak association is called Aggregation."
"73. How is the creation of a String using new() diﬀerent from that of a literal? Java Interview Questions When a String is formed as a literal with the assistance of an assignment operator, it makes its way into the String constant pool so that String Interning can take place. This same object in the heap will be referenced by a diﬀerent String if the content is the same for both of them. public bool checking() { String first = ""InterviewBit""; String second = ""InterviewBit""; if (first == second) return true; else return false; } The checking() function will return true as the same content is referenced by both the variables. Conversely, when a String formation takes place with the help of a new() operator, interning does not take place. The object gets created in the heap memory even if the same content object is present. Java Interview Questions public bool checking() { String first = new String(""InterviewBit""); String second = new String(""InterviewBit""); if (first == second) return true; else return false; } The checking() function will return false as the same content is not referenced by both the variables."
"74. How is the ‘new’ operator diﬀerent from the ‘newInstance()’ operator in java? Both ‘new’ and ‘newInstance()’ operators are used to creating objects. The diﬀerence is- that when we already know the class name for which we have to create the object then we use a new operator. But suppose we don’t know the class name for which we need to create the object, Or we get the class name from the command line argument, or the database, or the file. Then in that case we use the ‘newInstance()’ operator. Java Interview Questions The ‘newInstance()’ keyword throws an exception that we need to handle. It is because there are chances that the class definition doesn’t exist, and we get the class name from runtime. So it will throw an exception."
"75. Is exceeding the memory limit possible in a program despite having a garbage collector? Yes, it is possible for the program to go out of memory in spite of the presence of a garbage collector. Garbage collection assists in recognizing and eliminating those objects which are not required in the program anymore, in order to free up the resources used by them. In a program, if an object is unreachable, then the execution of garbage collection takes place with respect to that object. If the amount of memory required for creating a new object is not suﬀicient, then memory is released for those objects which are no longer in the scope with the help of a garbage collector. The memory limit is exceeded for the program when the memory released is not enough for creating new objects. Moreover, exhaustion of the heap memory takes place if objects are created in such a manner that they remain in the scope and consume memory. The developer should make sure to dereference the object a"
"76. Why is synchronization necessary? Explain with the help of a relevant example. Java Interview Questions Concurrent execution of diﬀerent processes is made possible by synchronization. When a particular resource is shared between many threads, situations may arise in which multiple threads require the same shared resource. Synchronization assists in resolving the issue and the resource is shared by a single thread at a time. Let’s take an example to understand it more clearly. For example, you have a URL and you have to find out the number of requests made to it. Two simultaneous requests can make the count erratic. No synchronization: package anonymous; public class Counting { private int increase_counter; public int increase() { increase_counter = increase_counter + 1; return increase_counter; } } Java Interview Questions If a thread Thread1 views the count as 10, it will be increased by 1 to 11. Simultaneously, if another thread Thread2 views the count as 10, it will be increased by 1 to 11. Thus, inconsistency in count values takes place because the expected final value is 12 but the actual final value we get will be 11. Now, the function increase() is made synchronized so that simultaneous accessing cannot take place. With synchronization: package anonymous; public class Counting { private int increase_counter; public synchronized int increase() { increase_counter = increase_counter + 1; return increase_counter; } } If a thread Thread1 views the count as 10, it will be increased by 1 to 11, then the thread Thread2 will view the count as 11, it will be increased by 1 to 12. Thus, consistency in count values takes place. Java Interview Questions"

In the given code below, what is the significance of ... ? public void fooBarMethod(String... variables){ // method code } Ability to provide ... is a feature called varargs (variable arguments) which was introduced as part of Java 5. The function having ... in the above example indicates that it can receive multiple arguments of the datatype String. For example, the fooBarMethod can be called in multiple ways and we can still have one method to process the data as shown below: fooBarMethod(""foo"", ""bar""); fooBarMethod(""foo"", ""bar"", ""boo""); fooBarMethod(new String[]{""foo"", ""var"", ""boo""}); public void myMethod(String... variables){ for(String variable : variables){ // business logic } }"
"78. What will be the output of the below java program and define the steps of Execution of the java program with the help of the below code?

Value of i = 0 Instance Block 2. Value of i = 5 Instance method. Welcome to InterviewBit This is a java tricky interview question frequently asked in java interviews for the experienced. The output will be like this because, when the java program is compiled and gets executed, then there are various steps followed for execution. And the steps are - Identification of Static Members from top to bottom. Execution of Static variable assignment and a Static block from top to bottom. Execution of the main method. Identification of Instance Members from top to bottom. Execution of Instance variable assignment and Instance block from top to bottom. Execution of Constructor. In above steps from 4 to 6, will be executed for every object creation. If we create multiple objects then for every object these steps will be performed. Now from the above code, the execution will happen like this -"
"1. In the step of identification of static members. It is found that - static int j. static block. main method. static method_2. During identification, the JVM will assign the default value in the static int j variable. Then it is currently in the state of reading and indirectly writing. Because the original value is not assigned. Java Interview Questions"
"2. In the next step, it will execute the static block and assign the value in static variables. First static block it will print and because execution from top to bottom and original value in j is not assigned. So it will print the default value of 0. A"
3. Now it will execute the main method. In which it will create an object for the class InterviewBit. And then the execution of instances will happen.
"4. Identify the instance variables and blocks from top to bottom. int i. Instance block 1. Instance method_1. Like a static variable, the instance variable also has been initialized with the default value 0 and will be in the state of reading and writing indirectly."
"5. It will execute the instance methods and assign the original value to the instance variable. Prints the Instance block 1. And the current value of i is not assigned till now, so it will print 0. Assign the original value to i. Then print instance block 2. And a"
"6. And at the last step, the constructor will be invoked and the lines will be executed in the constructor. This is how the java program gets executed."
"79. Define System.out.println(). Java Interview Questions System.out.println() is used to print the message on the console. System - It is a class present in java.lang package. Out is the static variable of type PrintStream class present in the System class. println() is the method present in the PrintStream class. So if we justify the statement, then we can say that if we want to print anything on the console then we need to call the println() method that was present in PrintStream class. And we can call this using the output object that is present in the System class."
"80. Can you explain the Java thread lifecycle? Java thread life cycle is as follows: New – When the instance of the thread is created and the start() method has not been invoked, the thread is considered to be alive and hence in the NEW state. Runnable – Once the start() method is invoked, before the run() method is called by JVM, the thread is said to be in RUNNABLE (ready to run) state. This state can also be entered from the Waiting or Sleeping state of the thread. Running – When the run() method has been invoked and the thread starts its execution, the thread is said to be in a RUNNING state. Non-Runnable (Blocked/Waiting) – When the thread is not able to run despite the fact of its aliveness, the thread is said to be in a NON-RUNNABLE state. Ideally, a"
"81. What could be the tradeoﬀ between the usage of an unordered array versus the usage of an ordered array? The main advantage of having an ordered array is the reduced search time complexity of O(log n) whereas the time complexity in an unordered array is O(n). The main drawback of the ordered array is its increased insertion time which is O(n) due to the fact that its element has to reordered to maintain the order of array during every insertion whereas the time complexity in the unordered array is only O(1). Considering the above 2 key points and depending on what kind of scenario a developer requires, the appropriate data structure can be used for implementation."
"82. Is it possible to import the same class or package twice in Java and what happens to it during runtime? It is possible to import a class or package more than once, however, it is redundant because the JVM internally loads the package or class only once. Java Interview Questions"
"83. In case a package has sub packages, will it suﬀice to import only the main package? e.g. Does importing of com.myMainPackage.* also import com.myMainPackage.mySubPackage.*? This is a big NO. We need to understand that the importing of the sub-packages of a package needs to be done explicitly. Importing the parent package only results in the import of the classes within it and not the contents of its child/sub-packages."
84. Will the finally block be executed if the code System.exit(0) is written at the end of try block? NO. The control of the program post System.exit(0) is immediately gone and the program gets terminated which is why the finally block never gets executed.
"85. What do you understand by marker interfaces in Java? Marker interfaces, also known as tagging interfaces are those interfaces that have no methods and constants defined in them. They are there for helping the compiler and JVM to get run time-related information regarding the objects."
"86. Explain the term “Double Brace Initialisation” in Java? This is a convenient means of initializing any collections in Java. Consider the below example. Java Interview Questions import java.util.HashSet; import java.util.Set; public class IBDoubleBraceDemo{ public static void main(String[] args){ Set<String> stringSets = new HashSet<String>() { { add(""set1""); add(""set2""); add(""set3""); } }; doSomething(stringSets); } private static void doSomething(Set<String> stringSets){ System.out.println(stringSets); } } In the above example, we see that the stringSets were initialized by using double braces. The first brace does the task of creating an anonymous inner class that has the capability of accessing the parent class’s behavior. In our example, we are creating the subclass of HashSet so that it can use the add() method of HashSet. The second braces do the task of initializing the instances. Care should be taken while initializing through this method as the method involves the creation of anonymous inner classes which can cause problems during the garbage collection or serialization processes and may also result in memory leaks."
"87. Why is it said that the length() method of String class doesn't return accurate results? Java Interview Questions The length method returns the number of Unicode units of the String. Let's understand what Unicode units are and what is the confusion below. We know that Java uses UTF-16 for String representation. With this Unicode, we need to understand the below two Unicode related terms: Code Point: This represents an integer denoting a character in the code space. Code Unit: This is a bit sequence used for encoding the code points. In order to do this, one or more units might be required for representing a code point. Under the UTF-16 scheme, the code points were divided logically into 17 planes and the first plane was called the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP). The BMP has classic characters - U+0000 to U+FFFF. The rest of the characters- U+10000 to U+10FFFF were termed as the supplementary characters as they were contained in the remaining planes. The code points from the first plane are encoded using one 16-bit code unit The code points from the remaining planes are encoded using two code units. Now if a string contained supplementary characters, the length function would count that as 2 units and the result of the length() function would not be as per what is expected. In other words, if there is 1 supplementary character of 2 units, the length of that SINGLE character is considered to be TWO - Notice the inaccuracy here? As per the java documentation, it is expected, but as per the real logic, it is inaccurate."
"88. What is the output of the below code and why? public class InterviewBit{ public static void main(String[] args) { System.out.println('b' + 'i' + 't'); } } Java Interview Questions “bit” would have been the result printed if the letters were used in double-quotes (or the string literals). But the question has the character literals (single quotes) being used which is why concatenation wouldn't occur. The corresponding ASCII values of each character would be added and the result of that sum would be printed. The ASCII values of ‘b’, ‘i’, ‘t’ are: ‘b’ = 98 ‘i’ = 105 ‘t’ = 116 98 + 105 + 116 = 319 Hence 319 would be printed."
"89. What are the possible ways of making object eligible for garbage collection (GC) in Java? First Approach: Set the object references to null once the object creation purpose is served. public class IBGarbageCollect { public static void main (String [] args){ String s1 = ""Some String""; // s1 referencing String object - not yet eligible for GC s1 = null; // now s1 is eligible for GC } } Second Approach: Point the reference variable to another object. Doing this, the object which the reference variable was referencing before becomes eligible for GC. public class IBGarbageCollect { public static void main(String [] args){ String s1 = ""To Garbage Collect""; String s2 = ""Another Object""; System.out.println(s1); // s1 is not yet eligible for GC s1 = s2; // Point s1 to other object pointed by s2 /* Here, the string object having the content ""To Garbage Collect"" is not referre } } Java Interview Questions Third Approach: Island of Isolation Approach: When 2 reference variables pointing to instances of the same class, and these variables refer to only each other and the objects pointed by these 2 variables don't have any other references, then it is said to have formed an “Island of Isolation” and these 2 objects are eligible for GC. public class IBGarbageCollect { IBGarbageCollect ib; public static void main(String [] str){ IBGarbageCollect ibgc1 = new IBGarbageCollect(); IBGarbageCollect ibgc2 = new IBGarbageCollect(); ibgc1.ib = ibgc2; //ibgc1 points to ibgc2 ibgc2.ib = ibgc1; //ibgc2 points to ibgc1 ibgc1 = null; ibgc2 = null; /* * We see that ibgc1 and ibgc2 objects refer * to only each other and have no valid * references- these 2 objects for island of isolcation - eligible for GC */ } }"

Let’s visually understand what's happening in the code. Java Interview Questions Java Interview Questions In the above figure on line 3, we can see that on each array index we are declaring a new array so the reference will be of that new array on all the 3 indexes. So the old array will be pointed to by none. So these three are eligible for garbage collection. And on line 4, we are creating a new array object on the older reference. So that will point to a new array and older multidimensional objects will become eligible for garbage collection."
"91. What is the best way to inject dependency? Also, state the reason. There is no boundation for using a particular dependency injection. But the recommended approach is - Setters are mostly recommended for optional dependencies injection, and constructor arguments are recommended for mandatory ones. This is because constructor injection enables the injection of values into immutable fields and enables reading them more easily."

"94. What is a Memory Leak? Discuss some common causes of it. Java Interview Questions The Java Garbage Collector (GC) typically removes unused objects when they are no longer required, but when they are still referenced, the unused objects cannot be removed. So this causes the memory leak problem. Example - Consider a linked list like the structure below - In the above image, there are unused objects that are not referenced. But then also Garbage collection will not free it. Because it is referencing some existing referenced object. So this can be the situation of memory leak. Some common causes of Memory leaks are - When there are Unbounded caches. Excessive page swapping is done by the operating system. Improper written custom data structures. Inserting into a collection object without first deleting it. etc."

"Data Engineer Interview Questions The application of data collecting and analysis is the emphasis of data engineering. The information gathered from numerous sources is merely raw information. Data engineering helps in the transformation of unusable data into useful information. It is the process of transforming, cleansing, profiling, and aggregating huge data sets in a nutshell."
"2. What is Data Modeling? Data Modeling is the act of creating a visual representation of an entire information system or parts of it in order to express linkages between data points and structures. The purpose is to show the many types of data that are used and stored in the system, as well as the relationships between them, how the data can be classified and arranged, and its formats and features. Data can be modeled according to the needs and requirements at various degrees of abstraction. The process begins with stakeholders and end-users providing information about business requirements. These business rules are then converted into data structures, which are used to create a concrete database design."
3. What are the design schemas available in data modeling? There are two design schemas available in data modeling: Star Schema Snowflake Schema
"4. What is the diﬀerence between a data engineer and a data scientist? Data Engineer Interview Questions Data science is a broad topic of research. It focuses on extracting data from extremely huge datasets (sometimes it is known as ""big data""). Data scientists can operate in a variety of fields, including industry, government, and applied sciences. All data scientists have the same goal: to analyze data and derive insights from it that are relevant to their field of work. A data engineer's job is to develop or integrate many components of complex systems, taking into account the information needed, the company's goals, and the end requirements. This necessitates the creation of extremely complicated data pipelines. These data pipelines, like oil pipelines, take raw, unstructured data from a variety of sources. They then channel them into a single database (or larger structure) for storage."
"5. What are the diﬀerences between structured and unstructured data? Data Engineer Interview Questions On the basis of Structured Unstructured Storage Structured data is stored in DBMS.It is stored in unmanaged file structures.

9. What is a NameNode? The HDFS system is built on the foundation of NameNode. It keeps track of where the data file is kept by storing the directory tree of the files in a single file system.
"10. What are the repercussions of the NameNode crash? In an HDFS cluster, there is only one NameNode. This node keeps track of DataNode metadata. Because there is only one NameNode in an HDFS cluster, it is the single point of failure. The system may become inaccessible if NameNode crashes. In a high- availability system, a passive NameNode backs up the primary one and takes over if the primary one fails."
"11. What is a block and block scanner in HDFS? Block: In HDFS, a ""block"" refers to the smallest amount of data that may be read or written. Block Scanner: Block Scanner keeps track of the list of blocks on a DataNode and checks them for checksum problems. To save disc bandwidth on the data node, Block Scanners use a throttling technique."
"12. What are the components of Hadoop? Hadoop has the following components: Data Engineer Interview Questions Hadoop Common: A collection of Hadoop tools and libraries. Hadoop HDFS: Hadoop's storage unit is the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS). HDFS stores data in a distributed fashion. HDFS is made up of two parts: a name node and a data node. While there is only one name node, numerous data nodes are possible. Hadoop MapReduce: Hadoop's processing unit is MapReduce. The processing is done on the slave nodes in the MapReduce technique, and the final result is delivered to the master node. Hadoop YARN: Hadoop's YARN is an acronym for Yet Another Resource Negotiator. It is Hadoop's resource management unit, and it is included in Hadoop version 2 as a component. It's in charge of managing cluster resources to avoid overloading a single machine."

The replication factor is set to 3 by default, however, it can be modified to 2 (less than 3) or raised to meet your needs (more than 3.)"
"27. What is the diﬀerence between HDFS block and InputSplit? Block InputSplit In Hadoop, a block is the physical representation of data. InputSplit is the logical representation of data in a block. It is primarily used in the MapReduce program or other data processing techniques. The HDFS block size is set to 128MB by default, but you can modify it to suit your needs. Except for the last block, which can be the same size or less, all HDFS blocks are the same size.By default, the InputSplit size is nearly equal to the block size."
"28. What is Apache Spark? Data Engineer Interview Questions Apache Spark is an open-source distributed processing solution for big data workloads. For rapid queries against any size of data, it uses in-memory caching and eﬀicient query execution. Simply put, Spark is a general-purpose data processing engine that is quick and scalable."
"29. What is the diﬀerence between Spark and MapReduce? Spark is a MapReduce improvement in Hadoop. The diﬀerence between Spark and MapReduce is that Spark processes and retains data in memory for later steps, whereas MapReduce processes data on the disc. As a result, Spark's data processing speed is up to 100 times quicker than MapReduce for lesser workloads. Spark also constructs a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) to schedule tasks and orchestrate nodes throughout the Hadoop cluster, as opposed to MapReduce's two-stage execution procedure.

"30. What are Skewed tables in Hive? Skewed tables are a type of table in which some values in a column appear more frequently than others. The distribution is skewed as a result of this. When a table is created in Hive with the SKEWED option, the skewed values are written to separate files, while the remaining data are written to another file. Data Engineer Interview Questions"
"31. What is SerDe in the hive? Serializer/Deserializer is popularly known as SerDe. For IO, Hive employs the SerDe protocol. Serialization and deserialization are handled by the interface, which also interprets serialization results as separate fields for processing. The Deserializer turns a record into a Hive-compatible Java object. The Serializer now turns this Java object into an HDFS-compatible format. The storage role is then taken over by HDFS. Anyone can create their own SerDe for their own data format."
32. What are the table creation functions in Hive? The following are some of Hive's table creation functions: Explode(array) Explode(map) JSON_tuple() Stack()
"33. What are *args and **kwargs used for? Data Engineer Interview Questions The *args function allows users to specify an ordered function for use in the command line, whereas the **kwargs function is used to express a group of unordered and in-line arguments to be passed to a function."
"34. What do you mean by spark execution plan? A query language statement (SQL, Spark SQL, Dataframe operations, etc.) is translated into a set of optimized logical and physical operations by an execution plan. It is a series of actions that will be carried out from the SQL (or Spark SQL) statement to the DAG(Directed Acyclic Graph), which will then be sent to Spark Executors."
"35. What is executor memory in spark? For a spark executor, every spark application has the same fixed heap size and fixed number of cores. The heap size is regulated by the spark.executor.memory attribute of the –executor-memory flag, which is also known as the Spark executor memory. Each worker node will have one executor for each Spark application. The executor memory is a measure of how much memory the application will use from the worker node."
"36. Explain how columnar storage increases query speed. Since it dramatically reduces total disc I/O requirements and the quantity of data you need to load from the disc, columnar storage for database tables is a critical factor in increasing analytic query speed. Each data block stores values of a single column in multiple rows using columnar storage."
"37. What is schema evolution? Data Engineer Interview Questions One set of data can be kept in several files with various yet compatible schemas with schema evolution. The Parquet data source in Spark can automatically recognize and merge the schema of those files. Without automatic schema merging, the most common method of dealing with schema evolution is to reload past data, which is time-consuming."
"38. What do you mean by data pipeline? A data pipeline is a system for transporting data from one location (the source) to another (the destination) (such as a data warehouse). Data is converted and optimized along the journey, and it eventually reaches a state that can be evaluated and used to produce business insights. The procedures involved in aggregating, organizing, and transporting data are referred to as a data pipeline. Many of the manual tasks needed in processing and improving continuous data loads are automated by modern data pipelines."
"39. What is orchestration? IT departments must maintain many servers and apps, but doing it manually isn't scalable. The more complicated an IT system is, the more diﬀicult it is to keep track of all the moving elements. As the requirement to combine numerous automated jobs and their configurations across groups of systems or machines grows, so does the demand to combine multiple automated tasks and their configurations across groups of systems or machines. This is where orchestration comes in handy. Data Engineer Interview Questions The automated configuration, management, and coordination of computer systems, applications, and services are known as orchestration. IT can manage complicated processes and workflows more easily with orchestration. There are many container orchestration platforms available such as Kubernetes and OpenShi"
"40. What are diﬀerent data validation approaches? The process of confirming the accuracy and quality of data is known as data validation. It is implemented by incorporating various checks into a system or report to ensure that input and stored data are logically consistent. Common types of data validation approaches are Data type check: It confirms that the data entered is of the correct data type. Code check: A code check verifies that a field is chosen from a legitimate list of options or that it corresponds to specific formatting constraints. Checking a postal code against a list of valid codes, for example, makes it easier to verify if it is valid. Range check: It ensures that input falls in a predefined range. Format check: Many data types follow a predefined format. Format check confirms that. For example, a date has formats like DD-MM-YY or MM-DD-YY. Consistency check: It confirms that the data entered is logically correct. Uniqueness check: It ensures that the same data is not entered multiple times."

Disadvantages: You need to specify how many elements you're going to store in your array ahead of time and We can not increase or decrease the size of the Array a"
"2. Diﬀerence between Array and ArrayList in Java. Array Interview Questions Definition An Array is a collection of similar data types stored in contiguous memory locations.An ArrayList is a class of Java Collections framework which contains popular classes like Vector, HashMap, etc. Static/ Dynamicstatic in size. dynamic in size. Resizable An array is not resizable as it is a fixed-length data structure.An ArrayList is a variable-length data structure that can be resized. As an element is being added to an ArrayList, JVM checks to see if it has enough space by calling the ensureCapacity method. If a space exists, it adds the element to the ArrayList, otherwise, it resizes the ArrayList.In the resizing process, an array of a larger size is created, the old array is copied to the new array using Arrays.copyOf, and the new array is then assigned to the existing array. Iitiliti Si f Ait f Array Interview Questions"
3. What will happen if you do not initialize an Array? The array will take default values depending upon the data type.
"4. What is the default value of Array in Java? If we don't specify the values by ourselves, then Java assigns default values in them which are 0 for byte, short, int, and long, 0.0 for float and double, false for boolean, and null for objects respectively."
5. What is the time complexity for performing basic operations in an array? The Time Complexity of diﬀerent operations in an array is: For analyzing the real- time complexity you also have to consider the time in bringing the block of memory from an external device to RAM which takes O(√N) time. ARRAY OPERATION REAL TIME COMPLEXITY ASSUMED TIME COM Accessing the i-th element.O(√N) O(1) Traversing all elements.O(N + √N) O(N) Override element at i-th index.O(√N) O(1) Insert an element. O(N + √N) O(N) Delete an element. O(N + √N) O(N)
"6. Can you declare an array without assigning the size of an array? Array Interview Questions No, we cannot declare an array without assigning size. If we declare an array without size, it will throw compile time error."
"7. Diﬀerence between Array and Object. An object represents a thing with characteristics (called a property), whereas an array creates a list of data and stores it in a single variable. Using brackets and dots, we can access, alter, and delete items from objects, while a variety of built- in methods and zero-based indexing allow us to access and modify items in arrays. We can iterate over object properties and array items using various diﬀerent loops (e.g. for, for…in, for…of, forEach()). All Java objects are dynamically allocated on the heap. Unlike C++, where objects can be allocated in memory either on Heap or on Stack. When we use the new() method in C++, the object is allocated on the heap, otherwise on Stack if not global or static."
"8. Where is an Array stored in JVM memory? An Array is an object in java. So, Array is stored in heap memory in Java Virtual Machine."
"9. Find the Target Element in an array. First of all, you will get a number n, which indicates the size of the array. A"
"10. Can a Negative number be passed in Array size? No, a negative number cannot be passed as array size. If you pass a negative number in Array size then you will get the NegativeArraySizeException at run time."
"11. When will we get ArrayStoreException? ArrayStoreException is a runtime exception. For example, you will get this exception at run time if you declare a String Array and then try to insert integer elements in the array."
12. When will we get ArrayIndexOutOfBounds Exception? ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsis a runtime exception that occurs when the program tries to access the invalid index of an array such as an Index higher than the size of the array or a negative index.
"13. We know that Arrays are objects so why cannot we write strArray.length()? Array Interview Questions We cannot write strArray.length() because length is not a method, it's a data item of an array. We can use the methods of Object like toString() and hashCode() against Array."
"14. What is the diﬀerence between length and length () in Java? In Java, the length() is a method of String class whereas length is an instance variable of an array. length in Java The length variable returns the length of an array i.e. a number of elements present in an array. A"
"15. What is a Jagged Array in Java? Jagged arrays are multidimensional arrays in which the member arrays are of diﬀerent sizes. As an example, we can make a 2D array where the first array contains three elements, and the second array consists of four elements. Below is an example demonstrating the concept of jagged arrays. public class InterviewBit { public static void main(String[] args){ int[][] 2dArray = new int[2][]; 2dArray[0] = new int[3]; 2dArray[1] = new int[4]; int counter = 0; for(int row=0; row <2dArray.length; row++){ for(int col=0; col < 2dArray[row].length; col++){ 2dArray[row][col] = counter++; } } for(int row=0; row < 2dArray.length; row++){ System.out.println(); for(int col=0; col < 2dArray[row].length; col++){ System.out.print(2dnArray[row][col] + "" ""); } } } } Output: public class InterviewBit { public static void main(String args[]) { String str = ""Welcome to InterviewBit""; System.out.println(""Length of String using length() method is: "" + str.length()); } } Array Interview Questions 0 1 2 3 4 5 6"
"16. Can the sizeof operator be used to tell the size of an array passed to a function? Passing an array as a parameter in C or C++ does not pass information about how many elements there are in the array. Although sizeof() can tell you the size of the pointer and the size of the type it points to, it cannot tell you how many bytes are occupied by the entire array. Array Interview Questions for Experienced"
"17. What do you mean by the terms “Dimension” and “Subscript” when we talk about arrays? In an array ""Dimension"" is the number of indices, or subscripts, that you need for specifying an individual element. Dimensions and subscripts may be confusing. A subscript is a number, while the dimension is a description of the range of acceptable keys. You only need 1 subscript for each dimension of the array. For example, arr[10][5] is an array having 2 dimensions: One with size 10 and the other with size 5. You need 2 subscripts to address its elements. One between 0 and 9, inclusive; the other between 0 and 4."
"18. Compare Arrays with Linked Lists. Array Interview Questions Size: The size of an array cannot be altered at runtime since data can only be stored in contiguous blocks of memory in an array. However, due to the node structure of a linked list, its size can be altered easily since each node points to the next one such that data can exist at scattered (non-contiguous) addresses. Memory allocation: For arrays, memory is allocated at compile time whereas for linked lists memory is allocated at runtime. But, a dynamically allocated array also allocates memory at runtime. Memory eﬀiciency: For the same number of elements, the linked list uses more memory due to its node structure since each node stores a reference to the next node along with the data. However, linked lists may use less memory overall compared to arrays when there is uncertainty about size or there are large variations in the size of data elements. Execution time: In the case of a linked list, all the previous elements must be traversed to reach any element whereas elements in an array can be accessed directly using their index. As a result, some operations such as modifying an element are faster in arrays, while some other operations such as inserting an element are faster in linked lists."
"19. Why is the complexity of fetching from an Array be O(1)? In an Array, objects are stored in continuous memory location. So, if you know the address of the base object then you will be able to find the address of the ith object. address(a[i]) = address(a[0]) + i*size(object) This term is independent of n, so the time complexity of fetching from an Array is O(1)."
"20. How do you find the missing integer in an array of range 1 to 100? Array Interview Questions During an interview, this question is o"
"21. How do you remove a particular element from an array? You can't directly remove elements from the original array, as arrays are fixed sets and the size can't change therefore the interviewer is looking for you to suggest an alternate solution and address the issue that the question presents. The best way to remove an element would be to create a new array. In this array, you could include copies of elements of the first array and omit only the element you want to remove. Another approach is searching for the target element in the array and then moving all the elements in one position back which are on the right side of the target element."
"22. How can you get the index of an array element? You can find the index of an element through a linear or binary search. A linear search is a function in which you loop through each and every element of an array until it finds the match of the desired element. When it finds the matching element, it returns the index. Therefore time complexity of the linear search is O(n). Linear search can be applied to sorted as well as an unsorted array. If the array is sorted, you can use a binary search that repeatedly splits the array in half until the median of the interval matches the desired element and returns the index. Therefore time complexity of the binary search is O(log n)."
"23. How do you merge two sorted arrays into one sorted array? Array Interview Questions During a programming interview, the employer may ask you to demonstrate your ability to work with more complex coding functions, such as merging arrays. Approach 1: To merge two arrays, you can create a new array of size equal to the sum of two arrays. A"
"24. How to check the equality of two arrays? You will be given two arrays and you have to check whether the 2 arrays are equal or not. Array Interview Questions First, you have to check the lengths of two given arrays. When the length of both arrays is the same, we compare corresponding elements of both arrays. Both the arrays will be considered equal If all corresponding pairs of elements are equal. If the arrays are big in size this method will be time-consuming therefore this method is not recommended to check the equality of two arrays. You can also use the in-built equals() method of Arrays class but in the interview, the interviewer may ask you to compare two arrays without using in-built functions therefore this method will help you at that time. Array Coding Interview Questions"
25. How do you sort an array of 0 and 1? You are given an array of 0s and 1s in random order and you have to sort this array i.e Segregate 0s on the le
26. How do you rotate an array? You will be given an input number N and N numbers following it as the input. You are also given an integer K which represents how many times you have to rotate the array. Rotate the array K values to the right if K is positive and K values to the le
"1. If the value of K is positive then do K=K%N where N is the length of the input array for eg: if k =10 and N=3 then k will become 1 which means rotating the array 10 times is equivalent to rotating the array 1 time. Similarly, If the value of K is negative, K=K%N + N."
2. Reverse the first part of the array i.e. from 0 to N-K-1 and the second part from N- K to N-1 separately.
"3. Reverse the entire array i.e. from 0 to N-1. K determines how the array will be rotated. Code: Array Interview Questions import java.io.*; import java.util.*; public class Main { public static void display(int[] arr) { StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(); for (int val : arr) { sb.append(val + "" ""); } System.out.println(sb); } public static void reverse(int[] arr, int li, int ri) { while (li < ri) { int t = arr[li]; arr[li] = arr[ri]; arr[ri] = t; li++; ri--; } } public static void rotate(int[] arr, int k) { k = k % arr.length; if (k < 0) { k += arr.length; } reverse(arr, 0, arr.length - k - 1); reverse(arr, arr.length - k, arr.length - 1); reverse(arr, 0, arr.length - 1); } Array Interview Questions public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception { BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in)); int n = Integer.parseInt(br.readLine()); int[] arr = new int[n]; for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) { arr[i] = Integer.parseInt(br.readLine()); } int k = Integer.parseInt(br.readLine()); rotate(arr, k); display(arr); }"
"27. Two sum of an array: In this question you will be given an array arr and a target. You have to return the indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target. In this question, you will be given an array arr and a target. You have to return the indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target. Approach: So the easiest and most eﬀicient solution is using a HashMap. We have to iterate through all the elements of the array and if (target-num) is present in the array then return {lower index, higher index} else push the value at arr[i] and the index i in the hashmap. Array Interview Questions public class InterviewBit { public int[] twoSum(int[] arr, int target) { HashMap<Integer,Integer> hash = new HashMap<Integer,Integer>(); for(int i = 0; i <arr.length; i++){ Integer diff = (Integer)(target - arr[i]); if(hash.containsKey(diff)){ int toReturn[] = {hash.get(diff)+1, i+1}; return toReturn; } hash.put(arr[i], i); } return null; } } The time Complexity for this approach will be O(n)."
"28. Check for balanced parenthesis in an expression using constant space. You will be given string str containing characters ‘(‘, ‘)’, ‘{‘, ‘}’, ‘[‘ and ‘]’, your task is to determine whether the brackets are balanced or not. These conditions should satisfy for balanced brackets: Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets. Open brackets must be closed in the correct order. Approach: Array Interview Questions To keep track of two brackets to be compared keep two variables i and j. Maintain a count variable and increment its value on encountering an opening bracket and decrements on encountering a closing bracket. Assign values of j and i as- j = i, i = i + 1 and counter++ when opening brackets are encountered.

"26. Explain the concept of modularization. Modularization is breaking down a program's functionality into separate, independent modules, each of which includes just the information needed to carry out one part of the intended capability. In simple terms, it is the practice of dividing the program into smaller modules so that we can deal with them separately. We can simply add independent and smaller modules to a program using modularization without being hampered by the complexity of the program's other functionalities. Modularization is based on the notion of designing applications that are easier to develop and maintain, self-contained components. In monolithic design, on the other hand, there's always the risk of a simple change knocking the entire application down. The final step would be to combine these independent modules. So"

"7. What is an Agile test plan? Agile test plans are very important documents that cover a variety of testing types carried out within an iteration, such as test data requirements, test environments, test infrastructure, and test results. In an agile model, test plans are written and updated for each new release. A typical agile test plan consists of the following: Agile Testing Interview Questions Scope of Testing. Test requirements, sprint objectives, and the scope of the task. New functionalities that are being tested. Testing levels or types based on feature complexity. Performance testing and load testing. Considerations related to infrastructure. Plan for mitigating or reducing risks. Resource allocation. Defining milestones and deliverables."
8. When should we use Agile Scrum Methodology? Agile Scrum Methodology can be used in the following situations: When the client isn't clear on what exactly they need. When the client expects a quick delivery of the product. When the client does not provide all the requirements at once. For projects where requirements fluctuate frequently.

"10. What is the story point in Agile? Agile story points are a metric for measuring the diﬀiculty of implementing a user story, and therefore reflect the level of eﬀort involved in implementing it. Story points are measures of the diﬀiculty level of a story. It can be related to the risks, complexities, and eﬀorts involved. An increasing number of story points will result in a greater eﬀort. One popular method for estimating agile story points is to use Fibonacci sequences. In this series, each number represents the sum of the two preceding ones. The Fibonacci sequence begins with 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89... and so forth."
"11. Explain Velocity in Agile Methodology. In Agile Methodology, Velocity is a measure of the amount of work a team can accomplish during an iteration, and is frequently used by development teams to build accurate and eﬀective timeframes. It is a simple calculation that measures how many units of work have been completed in a given period of time. There are several ways to measure units of work, such as story points, user stories, and engineer hours. Agile Testing Interview Questions From the chart above, it's clear that Sprint 5 was exceptionally productive - almost 40 story points were produced. Their average velocity is approximately 10 story points."

"20. Explain refactoring. The word 'refactoring' describes the process of improving the internal structure, the operation, or the aesthetics of a code or component without changing/aﬀecting its external behavior. Teams working in Agile are responsible for maintaining and enhancing their code on an incremental basis, Sprint by Sprint. Without refactoring, an Agile project will end up with poor code quality, such as unhealthy dependencies between classes, too many responsibilities per method, improper design of class responsibilities, and multiple forms of confusion and clutter. Code refactoring helps to simplify ambiguous and complex code by removing chaos. In the following example, it can be seen that the 5th module is a refactor. A refactor (5th) is usually broken down into several sequential micro-refactors, and each of those micro-refactors must be tested to ensure they are free from errors.

4. What are the features of JUnit? Following are the features of JUnit: JUnit is an open-source framework. Supports automated testing of test suites. Provides annotations for identifying the test methods. Provides assertions to test expected results or exceptions of the methods under test. Provides a platform for running test cases automatically and checking their results and giving feedback.
"5. Is it mandatory to write test cases for every logic? No, it is not mandatory. However, test cases can be written for the logic which can be reasonably broken and tested independently."
"6. What are some of the important annotations provided by JUnit? Some of the annotations provided by JUnit are as follows: JUnit Interview Questions @Test: This annotation over a public method of void return type can be run as a test case. This is a replacement of the org.junit.TestCase annotation. @Before: This is used when we want to execute the preconditions or any initialisation based statements before running every test case. @BeforeClass: This is used when we want to execute statements before all test cases. The statements may include test connections, common setup initialisation etc. @After: This is used when we want to execute statements a"
"7. How will you write a simple JUnit test case? Let us understand how to write a simple JUnit Test Case using an example. Consider a Calculator class that has a method that adds 2 numbers: public class Calculator { public int add(int num1, int num2) { return num1 + num2; } } Let us write a test case in JUnit 5 to this method under a class named CalculatorTest. JUnit Interview Questions import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals; import org.junit.jupiter.api.BeforeEach; import org.junit.jupiter.api.DisplayName; import org.junit.jupiter.api.RepeatedTest; import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test; public class CalculatorTest { Calculator calcObject; @BeforeEach void setUp() { calcObject = new Calculator(); } @Test @DisplayName(""Add 2 numbers"") void addTest() { assertEquals(15, calcObject.add(10, 5)); } @RepeatedTest(5) @DisplayName(""Adding a number with zero to return the same number"") void testAddWithZero() { assertEquals(15, calcObject.add(0, 15)); } } From the above example, we can see that: @BeforeEach annotated method runs before each test case. In JUnit 4, this annotation was @Before. @Test annotation indicates that the method is a test method. @DisplayName is used for defining the test name displayed to the user. assertEquals() method is used for validating whether the expected and actual values are equal. @RepeatedTest annotation indicates that the test method will be run 5 times."
8. What will happen if the return type of the JUnit method is String? The test case execution will fail because the JUnit methods are designed to return void.
9. What is the importance of @Test annotation? @Test annotation is used for marking the method as a test method. JUnit Interview Questions
10. What is a JUnit fixture? Fixture represents a fixed state of object sets used as a baseline for running test methods. This is to ensure there is a fixed and well-known environment where the results of the test methods are repeatable when run multiple times. The fixture has the following 2 methods: setUp()This runs before every test case is run. tearDown() This method is run a
11. What is a test suite? A test suite is a bundle of multiple unit test cases which can be run together. The following image represents how to test suite looks like: We can use @RunWith and @Suite annotations over the test class for running the test suite.
"12. What is mocking and stubbing? Mocking is a phenomenon where an object mimics a real object. Whereas, stubbing are the codes responsible for taking place of another component. Mockito, EasyMock are some of the mocking frameworks in Java."
"13. What are the JUnit Assert Methods? JUnit Interview Questions Assert methods are utility methods that support assert conditions in test cases. They belong to the Assert class in JUnit 4 and the Assertions class in JUnit 5. It is recommended to import the assert methods statically to the test class for avoiding using the class as a prefix to the method. Let us consider an example of the Multiplier class: public class Multiplier{ public int multiply(int num1, int num2){ return num1 * num2; } } Following are some of the assert methods: assertEquals(): This method compares 2 objects for equality by making use of the equals() method of the object. This is shown in the test case that multiplies 2 methods and checks for the expected and actual value below. @Test @DisplayName(""Multiplying 2 numbers"") public void multiplyTest() { assertEquals(50, multiplier.multiply(10, 5)); } When two objects are found to be equal based on the equals() method implementation of the object, then assertEquals() returns normally. Else, an exception will be thrown and the test will stop its execution. assertTrue(): This method tests whether the value of a variable is true. @Test public void checkNumTest() { int num1 = 20; assertTrue(""Number is not equal to 0"", num1!=0); } If the assertion fails, then an exception will be thrown and the test execution will be stopped. JUnit Interview Questions assertFalse(): This method tests whether the value of a variable is false. @Test public void checkNumTest() { int num1 = -20; assertFalse(""Number is not greater than 0"",num1>0); } If the assertion fails, then an exception will be thrown and the test execution will be stopped. assertNull(): This method tests if a variable is null. If null, it returns normally else an exception will be thrown and the test stops execution. @Test public void checkNullTest() { int num1 = null; assertNull(""Number is null"",num1); } assertNotNull(): This method tests whether a variable is not null. If it is not null, then the test returns normally else an exception will be thrown and the test stops its execution. @Test public void checkNotNullTest() { int num1 = null; assertNotNull(""Number is null"",num1); } assertSame(): This method checks if two references of the object are pointing to the same object. @Test public void checkAssertSameTest() { Object num1 = new Object(); Object num2 = new Object(); assertSame(num1, num2); } JUnit Interview Questions If the object references are pointing to the same object, the test runs normally else, it will throw an exception and the test execution is aborted. assertNotSame(): This method checks if two references of an object are not pointing to the same object. @Test public void checkAssertSameTest() { Object num1 = new Object(); Object num2 = new Object(); assertSame(num1, num2); } If the object references are not pointing to the same object, the test runs normally else, it will throw an exception and the test execution is aborted. assertThat(): This method compares the object to org.hamcrest.Matcher for checking if it matches whatever the Matcher class requires for the object to match. Consider the following code. import static org.hamcrest.MatcherAssert.assertThat; import static org.hamcrest.Matchers.hasItems; import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test; public class MultiplierTest { @Test public void assertThatTest() { assertThat( Arrays.asList(1,2,3,4), hasItems(2,3)); } } In this code, we will be asserting that the list has some items specified in the hamcrest’s hasItems() method. If the assertThat is successful, i.e if the list indeed has items specified, then the test runs normally. Else, the test throws an exception and the test stops executing."
"14. What is the importance of @RunWith annotation? JUnit Interview Questions @RunWith annotation lets us run the JUnit tests with other custom JUnit Runners like SpringJUnit4ClassRunner, MockitoJUnitRunner etc. We can also do parameterized testing in JUnit by making use of @RunWith(Parameterized.class)."
"15. How does JUnit help in achieving tests isolation? For calling test methods, JUnit creates separate individual instances of the test class. For example, if the test class contains 10 tests, then JUnit creates 10 instances of the class to execute the test methods. In this way, every test is isolated from the other. JUnit Interview Questions for Experienced"
"16. What are the best practices for writing Unit Test Cases? A standard unit test case comprises a known input and an expected output. These two things need to be known before we run the test case. A known input is tested for a precondition and an expected output is tested by postcondition. Following are the best practices for writing unit test cases: For every method, we need to have at least two unit test cases - a positive test case and a negative test case. If there are sub-requirements for a requirement, then those sub-requirements should have their own positive and negative test cases. Each test case should be independent of other test cases. If we make a chain of unit test cases, then it would not be possible for finding the root cause of the test case failures. Mock all the external services that are used by the modules under test. This is necessary because we do not want to unnecessarily debug our modules under test due to the failures of the external systems. Configuration settings need not be tested as they won’t be part of any unit code. Even if we want to inspect the configuration, then test whether the loading code is working or not. The unit test cases should be named consistently and clearly. The names of the test cases should be dependent on the operations that the test case would test."

"19. How to ignore tests in JUnit? JUnit Interview Questions We need to ignore test cases when we have certain functionalities that are not certain or they are under development. To wait for the completion of the code, we can avoid running these test cases. In JUnit 4, we can achieve this by using @Ignore annotation over the test methods. In JUnit 5, we can do it using @Disabled annotation over the test methods."
20. What is the purpose of @Before and @A
"21. How can we test protected methods? For testing protected methods, the test class should be declared in the same package as that of the target class."
"22. Why can't we use System.out.println() for testing and debugging? If we use System.out.println() for debugging, then we would have to do a manual scan of the outputs every time program is executed to ensure that the output printed is the expected output. Also, in the longer run, writing JUnit tests will be easier and will take lesser time. Writing test cases will be like an initial investment and then, later on, we can later automatically test them on the classes."
"23. How can we run JUnit from the command window? The first step is to set the CLASSPATH with the library path. Then invoke the JUnit runner by running the command: java org.junit.runner.JUnitCore JUnit Interview Questions To run the test class via commandline, we would first have to compile the class. This can be done by running: Then we can run the compiled test class using the console launcher of JUnit by running the following command:"
"24. How do you assert exceptions thrown in JUnit 4 tests? Consider an example to see how to write test cases for asserting exceptions. The method convertToUpperCase() defined in the ExceptionDemo class would throw an IllegalArgumentException if an empty string is passed as an input to the method. Let us write unit test cases for asserting the exception thrown in the code. In JUnit, there are 3 diﬀerent ways of achieving this and they are as follows: try-catch idiom: We can use the try-catch block for asserting exception as shown below: javac -d target -cp target:junit-platform-console-standalone-1.7.2.jar src/test/java/co java -jar junit-platform-console-standalone-1.7.2.jar --class-path target --select-clas import org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils; public final class ExceptionDemo { public String convertToUpperCase(String input) { if (StringUtils.isEmpty(input)) { throw new IllegalArgumentException(""Input empty, cannot convert to upper cas } return input.toUpperCase(); } } JUnit Interview Questions @Test public void convertToUpperCaseWithTryCatchTest{ try { exceptionDemo.convertToUpperCase(""""); fail(""It should throw IllegalArgumentException""); } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) { Assertions.assertThat(e) .isInstanceOf(IllegalArgumentException.class) .hasMessage(""Input empty, cannot convert to upper case!!""); } } @Test expected annotation: Here we give the expected exception as value to the expected parameter of the @Test annotation as:@Test(expected = IllegalArgumentException.class) When no exception is thrown by the target method under test, then we will get the below message: java.lang.AssertionError: Expected exception: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException Care has to be taken here while defining the expected Exception. We should not expect general Exception, RuntimeException or even a Throwable type of exceptions as that is a bad practice. If we do so, then there are chances that the code can throw an exception in other places and the test case can pass. Here we cannot assert the message in the exception. The code snippet of the test method would be: @Test(expected = IllegalArgumentException.class) public void convertToUpperCaseExpectedTest() { exceptionDemo.convertToUpperCase(""""); } Junit @Rule: The same example can be created using the ExceptedException rule. The rule must be a public field marked with @Rule annotation. JUnit Interview Questions @Rule public ExpectedException exceptionRule = ExpectedException.none(); @Test public void convertToUpperCaseRuleTest() { exceptionRule.expect(IllegalArgumentException.class); exceptionRule.expectMessage(""Input empty, cannot convert to upper case!!""); exceptionDemo.convertToUpperCase(""""); } In this approach, when the exception is not thrown, we will get:"

"26. What are Hamcrest Matchers? Hamcrest is a JUnit framework used to write matcher objects that provides ‘match’ rules definition in a declarative manner. They are used in UI validation, data filtering and for writing flexible unit tests. Hamcrest matches are used in the assertThat() method in JUnit. We can use one or more matchers within this assert method. Some of the matcher methods are as follows: JUnit Interview Questions Matcher Description Example allOf() This calculates the logical conjunction of multiple matchers and the object under consideration should match all of the matcher given.assertThat(""InterviewBit"",allOf(sta --> All conditions should match for a anyOf() This is used for calculating the logical disjunction of multiple matchers.

28. What is the keyboard shortcut for running the Junit test cases in eclipse IDE? We can press Alt+Shi
"29. Define code coverage. What are the diﬀerent types of code coverages? The extent to which the source code is unit tested is called coverage. There are three types of coverage techniques, they are: JUnit Interview Questions Statement coverage: This ensures that each statement/line in the source code is executed and tested. Decision coverage: This ensures that every decision point that results in true or false is executed and run. Path coverage: This ensures that every possible route from a given point is run and tested."
"30. Is it possible to test the Java method for a timeout in JUnit? Yes, it is possible. @Test annotation provides a timeout parameter that takes value in milliseconds in JUnit that is used for instructing JUnit to pass or fail the test method based on execution time. For instance, if a test method has Test annotation as @Test(timeout=30), then it means that if the execution does not complete in 30ms, then the test case will be failed. This helps in verifying the SLA of the Java method."
31. What are some of the best practices to be followed while writing code for making it more testable? Following are some of the best practices that can be followed while coding to make the code more testable: Make use of interfaces as a wrapper to implementation classes. This helps testers to replace the class with mocks or stubs to test the module. Use dependency injection wherever needed instead of creating. new objects. This makes it easy for testing individual modules and also supply dependency in the test configuration. Avoid using static methods as that makes it diﬀicult to test because they cannot be called polymorphically.
"32. Why does JUnit report only the first failure in a single attempt? JUnit is usually designed in a way that it deals with smaller tests and is capable of running each assessment with a boundary of separate analysis. Due to this, it reports only the first failure on each test case attempt."
"33. How can we do testing for private methods? JUnit Interview Questions It is generally not required to test private methods directly. Since they are private, it is assumed that they are called from public methods. If these methods are working as expected, then by extension it is considered that the private methods are working correctly. However, we can explore how the private methods are tested using reflection. Let us consider we have a public class Item with private method getItemName() as shown below: public class Item { private String getItemName(String itemName) { //Some logic if(itemName.equals(""computer"")) { return itemName; } return ""laptop""; } } Consider we have a test class ItemTest that tests this method as shown below: import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals; import java.lang.reflect.Method; import org.junit.BeforeClass; import org.junit.Test; public class ItemTest { public static Item item; @BeforeClass public static void beforeClass() { item = new Item(); } @Test public void testGetItemNameSuccess() throws Exception { String expectedName = ""computer""; Method method = Item.class.getDeclaredMethod(""getItemName"", String.class); method.setAccessible(true); String actualName = (String) method.invoke(item, actualName); assertEquals(expectedName, actualName); } } JUnit Interview Questions In the above code, we see that we can test the private method by using getDeclaredMethod method of the Method class that belongs to reflection strategy. Since we know that the private methods cant be invoked directly, we can use the Method class object’s invoke() method and send the input parameters. Then as usual, we can compare the results with the expected and the actual methods."
"34. How can you test a generics class? Generics allows creating classes, interfaces or methods that operate with diﬀerent data types at a time. In order to test Generic entities, we can test it for one or two datatypes for the logic since the datatype allocation are evaluated at compilation time for type-correctness. JUnit Mockito Interview Questions"
"35. Why do we need mocking in unit testing? Mocking is the process of creating and using mock objects that simulates the behaviour of real objects and is used to isolate the behaviour of the module under test from its external dependencies or services. These are particularly useful in unit testing and help in making unit test cases repeatable and predictable. Mocking is required in the following cases: Whenever the module under test has dependencies that are not fully implemented. For example, if we have a module that calls a REST API that is still in progress, then to test our module, it is advised to mock the API call and perform unit testing of our module. Whenever the module under test updates the system states. For example, whenever the module involves database calls that creates or updates or delete data from the system, it is very much important to mock those objects. Even if we have DB calls that just retrieves the data, it is advised to mock those because of the risk of DB availability."
"36. What is Mockito? What are some of its advantages? JUnit Interview Questions Mockito is an open-source, Java-based, mocking framework that allows the creation of test objects that simulate the behaviour (mock) of real-world objects. This helps in achieving test-driven or behaviour-driven development. The framework allows developers to verify system behaviours without establishing expectations. Mockito framework attempts to eliminate expect-run-verify development patterns by removing external specifications and dependencies. Some of the advantages of Mockito are: Mocks are created at runtime, hence reordering method input parameters or renaming interface methods will not break test code. Mockito supports returning of values. It supports exception simulation It provides a check on the order of method calls. It helps in creating mock objects using annotation."
"37. When and why should we use spy? Spy is a partial mock object supported by the Mockito framework. Following are the features of spy objects: Whenever mock is not set up, interaction on spy results in real method calls. Spy objects allow verifying interactions such as whether the method was called and how many times it was called, etc. They provide flexibility for setting up partial mocks. For instance, if an object has 2 methods, and we want one method to be mocked and the other to be called actually, then we can use spies. The main diﬀerence between mock and spy is that in mock, we create a complete fake object whereas, in spy, we have a hybrid of a real object and fake/stubbed methods."
"38. What is the diﬀerence between thenReturn and doReturn? thenReturn and doReturn are used for setting up stubs and are provided by the Mockito framework. They are generally used along with when clause as --> when- thenReturn and doReturn-when. when-thenReturn is used in most cases due to better readability. JUnit Interview Questions Following are the diﬀerences between thenReturn and doReturn: Type safety: doReturn takes Object parameter, unlike thenReturn. Hence there is no type check in doReturn at compile time. In the case of thenReturn, whenever the type mismatches during runtime, the WrongTypeOfReturnValue exception is raised. This is why when-thenReturn is a better option whenever we know the type. No side-eﬀect: Since doReturn does not have type safety, there are no side eﬀects when it is being used. Whenever thenReturn is used, if the type mismatch occurs, an exception is thrown which might result in the abortion of test cases."
"39. What is the main diﬀerence between @Mock and @InjectMocks? @Mock annotation is used for creating mocks whereas @InjectMocks is used for creating class objects. Whenever the actual method body has to be executed of a given class, then we can use @InjectMocks."
"40. Why can’t we mock static methods in Mockito? Static methods belong to the class and not to any objects which means that all instances of the class use the same static method. They are more like procedural code and are used in legacy systems. Mock libraries create mocks at runtime utilizing dynamic instance creation using interfaces or inheritance. Since static methods are not linked with any instance, it is not possible to mock them using Mockito. However, we have frameworks like PowerMock that supports static methods."
"41. How can we mock void methods in Mockito? Consider we have a method called updateItem() which internally calls a void method called updateItem() which interacts with the database and updates the object. JUnit Interview Questions public Item updateItem(Item item) { if (item == null || item.getItemId() < 0) { throw new IllegalArgumentException(""Invalid Id""); } itemRepository.updateItem(item); //void method that updates database state return item; } We can mock the void method in the following ways:"
"1. doNothing-when: This is used when we do not want to check for the return parameters and skip the actual execution. When this mocked method is called, then it does nothing. The test case would be: @Test public void updateItemTest() { Item item = new Item(2, ""Item 1""); doNothing().when(itemRepository).updateItem(any(Item.class)); itemService.updateItem(item); }"
"2. doAnswer-when: We can also make use of doAnswer-when whenever we need to perform additional actions like computing return values based on method parameters when a mocked method is called. This is done using the following: @Test public void updateItemTest() { Item item = new Item(2, ""Item 2""); doAnswer((args) -> { System.out.println(""doAnswer block entered.""); assertEquals(customer, args.getArgument(0)); return null; }).when(itemRepository).updateItem(any(Item.class)); itemService.updateItem(item); }"

Additionally, you can use logical operators, such as ""&"" and ""|"", to evaluate conditions and return boolean values. R Interview Questions"
"7. How can you import and export data in R? Data can be imported and exported in R using the read.table() and write.table() functions, respectively. To import data from a file, use the read.table() function with the file path and the delimiter of the data as arguments. For example: data <- read.table(""data.txt"", sep="","") To export data to a file, use the write.table() function with the data object, the file path, and the delimiter as arguments. For example: write.table(data, ""data.txt"", sep="","") Alternatively, data can also be imported and exported using other functions such as read.csv() and write.csv() for CSV files, read.xlsx() and write.xlsx() for Excel files, and read.sav() and write.sav() for SPSS files."
"8. Explain the concept of data frames in R? A data frame in R is a table-like data structure that contains multiple variables of diﬀerent data types in the same row. It is a two-dimensional data structure that allows for easy manipulation and analysis of data. Each variable in a data frame is represented as a column, and each row contains a record of the observations for each variable. Data frames are a fundamental data type in R, and are commonly used for working with large datasets. They can be created from various sources, including CSV files, databases, and other data structures, and can be easily manipulated and transformed using various R functions. Example - Consider the below table R Interview Questions Student ID Name Quiz 1 Quiz 2 Midterm 1001 Alice 85 92 89 1002 Bob 78 84 80 1003 Charlie 92 88 91 1004 David 80 77 85 In this table, each row represents a student, and each column represents a type of assessment. The columns include Quiz 1, Quiz 2, Midterm, and Final. The values in each cell represent the score that each student received on the corresponding assessment. For example, Alice received a score of 85 on Quiz 1, a score of 92 on Quiz 2, a score of 89 on the Midterm, and a score of 93 on the Final. To create this data frame, The R Code - # Create a data frame my_data <- data.frame( ""Student ID"" = c(1001, 1002, 1003, 1004), ""Name"" = c(""Alice"", ""Bob"", ""Charlie"", ""David""), ""Quiz 1"" = c(85, 78, 92, 80), ""Quiz 2"" = c(92, 84, 88, 77), ""Midterm"" = c(89, 80, 91, 85), ""Final"" = c(93, 87, 90, 82) ) # Print the data frame print(my_data)"
"9. How can you perform basic statistical analysis in R? To perform basic statistical analysis in R, follow these steps: R Interview Questions Install and load the necessary packages. For example, to perform basic descriptive statistics, you can use the ""psych"" package. To install and load it, run the following code: install.packages(""psych"") library(psych) Import or create the data you want to analyze. You can import data from a file or create it manually by entering the values in a vector. For example, to create a vector of 10 random numbers, you can use the rnorm() function: data <- rnorm(10) Use the appropriate function to perform the statistical analysis. For example, to calculate the mean of the data, you can use the mean() function: mean(data) To visualize the data, use the appropriate plotting function. For example, to create a histogram of the data, you can use the hist() function: hist(data) To perform more advanced statistical analysis, you can use additional functions from the packages or from other packages. For example, to perform a t-test, you can use the t.test() function: t.test(data)"
"10. What are the diﬀerent data visualization techniques in R? There are several data visualization techniques in R, including: R Interview Questions"
1. Bar plots: for comparing categorical data
2. Histograms: for visualizing the distribution of numeric data
3. Scatter plots: for showing the relationship between two numeric variables
4. Line plots: for visualizing the trend of a numeric variable over time
5. Box plots: for displaying the range and quartiles of numeric data
6. Bubble plots: for visualizing three-dimensional data
7. Heatmaps: for visualizing the intensity of data across two dimensions
8. Pie charts: for displaying proportions of a whole
9. Network diagrams: for showing relationships between elements in a network
10. Sankey diagrams: for showing flows between elements in a system.
"11. Explain the concept of packages in R and how to use them? In R, a package is a collection of functions, data, and documentation that extends the capabilities of base R. Packages are created and maintained by members of the R community and provide a way to easily share code and data. To use a package in R, you first need to install it using the install.packages() function. For example, to install the dplyr package, you would run the following code: install.packages(""dplyr"") Once a package is installed, you can use it in your R code by using the library() function to load it. For example, to use the dplyr package, you would run the following code: library(dplyr) A"
"12. What are the diﬀerent control structures in R and how to use them? R Interview Questions In R, there are several types of control structures that you can use to control the flow of execution in your code. These control structures include:"
1. if statements: There are used to execute a certain block of code only if a certain condition is met.
2. for loops: There are used to repeat a block of code a specific number of times.
3. while loops: These are used to repeat a block of code while a certain condition is true.
"4. repeat loops: These are similar to while loops but do not have a stopping condition, so they will continue to repeat the code until they are explicitly stopped. Here is an example of how you might use these control structures in R: R Interview Questions # If statement example if (x > 10) { # This code will only be executed if x is greater than 10 print(""x is greater than 10"") } # For loop example for (i in 1:10) { # This code will be executed 10 times, with i taking on the values 1 through 10 print(i) } # While loop example while (x < 100) { # This code will be executed repeatedly as long as x is less than 100 x <- x + 1 print(x) } # Repeat loop example repeat { # This code will be executed repeatedly until the loop is explicitly stopped x <- x + 1 print(x) # Stop the loop if x becomes greater than 100 if (x > 100) { break } } In general, it's important to use control structures like these in your code to make it more readable and easier to understand. They also help you avoid writing repetitive code, which can make your code more eﬀicient and less prone to errors."
"13. Explain the concept of functions in R and how to write them? In R, a function is a block of code that takes one or more inputs (called arguments), performs a set of operations on those inputs, and returns one or more outputs (called return values). Functions are useful because they allow us to reuse code and avoid repeating the same operations multiple times. R Interview Questions To write a function in R, we use the ""function"" keyword followed by a pair of parentheses, inside which we specify the input arguments. The body of the function is contained within a pair of curly braces, and within this body, we can perform any operations we want on the input arguments and return the desired output. Here is an example of a simple function that takes a numeric vector as input and returns the sum of its elements: # Define the function sum_vector <- function(x) { # Calculate the sum of the vector elements sum_x <- sum(x) # Return the sum return(sum_x) } # Call the function with a sample vector v = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) sum_vector(v) The function first calculates the sum of the elements in the input vector using the ""sum()"" function, and then returns this value using the ""return()"" function. When we call the function with a sample vector, it will output the sum of the vector elements."
"14. Explain the concept of object-oriented programming in R? Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that revolves around the concept of ""objects"", which are self-contained units of data and functionality. In OOP, objects are created from user-defined classes, which act as templates that define the properties and behaviours of objects. In R, OOP is implemented through the use of the S3 and S4 classes. S3 classes are the simplest and most commonly used in R, and consist of a set of attributes and methods that define the object's characteristics and behaviour. S4 classes, on the other hand, are more complex and provide more control over object behaviour and inheritance. R Interview Questions OOP in R allows for the creation of more organized and modular code, as well as the ability to reuse and extend existing classes and objects. It also enables the use of polymorphism, which allows objects of diﬀerent classes to be treated similarly, allowing for more flexible and dynamic code."
"15. What are the diﬀerent classes in R and how to create them? There are several classes in R, including: Numeric: This class includes numbers, such as integers and floating point values. To create a numeric class in R, you can use the ""as.numeric()"" function. For example: my_numeric_value <- as.numeric(2) Character: This class includes strings or text values. To create a character class in R, you can use the ""as.character()"" function. For example: my_character_value <- as.character(""Hello World"") Factor: This class includes categorical data that can be grouped into levels or categories. To create a factor class in R, you can use the ""factor()"" function. For example: my_factor_value <- factor(c(""A"", ""B"", ""A"", ""C"", ""B"")) Date: This class includes the date and time values. To create a date class in R, you can use the ""as.Date()"" function. For example: my_date_value <- as.Date(""2022-01-01"") List: This class includes a collection of objects of diﬀerent classes. To create a list class in R, you can use the ""list()"" function. For example: R Interview Questions my_list_value <- list(1, ""Hello"", as.Date(""2022-01-01""))"
"16. Explain the concept of exception handling in R? Exception handling in R refers to the process of catching and handling errors or exceptions that may occur during the execution of a R script. This is important in ensuring that the script does not crash or stop executing due to an unexpected error or exception. To handle exceptions in R, we use the tryCatch() function which takes a code block as its first argument and one or more error-handling functions as subsequent arguments. These error-handling functions are executed when an error or exception occurs within the code block, allowing us to handle the error in a specific way. For example, we can use the tryCatch() function to suppress the error message and continue with the execution of the script, or to print a custom error message and exit the script. This allows us to gracefully handle errors and exceptions in our R code, improving the stability and reliability of our scripts. Certainly! R uses the tryCatch() function for exception handling. Here's an example code that demonstrates the usage of tryCatch(): Let's understand with the help of an example code to understand it better - R Interview Questions # Define a function that throws an error my_function <- function(x) { if (x < 0) { stop(""Error: x cannot be negative"") } else { return(sqrt(x)) } } # Call the function with valid input result1 <- tryCatch({ my_function(25) }, error = function(e) { print(paste(""Caught an exception:"", e$message)) }) # Print the result print(result1) # Call the function with invalid input result2 <- tryCatch({ my_function(-10) }, error = function(e) { print(paste(""Caught an exception:"", e$message)) }) # Print the result print(result2) In this example, we define a function called my_function() that takes a single input x. If x is negative, the function throws an error using the stop() function. Otherwise, it returns the square root of x. We then call my_function() twice - once with a valid input of 25, and once with an invalid input of -10. In each case, we wrap the function."
"17. Explain the concept of regular expressions in R and how to use them? Regular expressions, or ""regex,"" are a set of characters and symbols used to match and find patterns in text. In R, regular expressions are typically used with the grep() function to search for specific patterns within a character vector. R Interview Questions To use regular expressions in R, you must first specify the pattern you are searching for using a combination of characters and special symbols. For example, the pattern [0-9] will match any single digit, while [A-Z] will match any uppercase letter. Once you have specified the pattern, you can use the grep() function to search for that pattern within a character vector. For example, the code grep(""[0-9]"", c(""apple"", ""banana"", ""1234"")) will return the index positions of the vector where the pattern is found, in this case returning 3. Regular expressions can also include special symbols such as ^ to match the start of a string, $ to match the end of a string, and .* to match any characters in between. These symbols can be combined to create more complex patterns, allowing for more precise searches within a character vector."
"18. Explain the concept of time series analysis in R? Time series analysis is a statistical method used to analyze and model the patterns and trends of data over time. This is typically used to forecast future values based on past data. In R, time series analysis involves using functions and packages such as ts(), decompose(), and forecast() to manipulate and analyze time series data. This can include operations such as smoothing, filtering, and decomposition to better understand the underlying patterns and trends in the data. Time series analysis in R also o"
"19. What is Shiny in R and how to use it for web development? Shiny is a web application framework for the R programming language. It allows users to create interactive web applications using R without needing to know any web development languages like HTML, CSS, or JavaScript. To use Shiny for web development, you first need to install the Shiny package in R. Once installed, you can use Shiny's functions and templates to create a web application. This typically involves writing R code to define the layout and functionality of the application, as well as any necessary data or visualizations. R Interview Questions Once the application is complete, you can run it locally on your computer or deploy it to a Shiny server to make it available to others. Users can then access the application through a web browser and interact with it using the controls and features you have defined. Shiny is a powerful tool for creating interactive web applications using R and can be used for a wide range of purposes, including data analysis, visualization, and machine learning."
"20. Write a function in R to calculate the mean of a given vector of numbers. To calculate the mean of a given vector of numbers in R, we can use the mean() function from the base R package. The syntax for the mean() function is as follows: mean(x, na.rm = FALSE, trim = 0, ...) where x is the input vector of numbers, na.rm is a logical value indicating whether to remove missing values (NA) from the calculation, trim is the proportion of observations to trim from each end of the vector before calculating the mean, and ... are additional arguments. Here is an example of how to use the mean() function to calculate the mean of a vector of numbers: # create a vector of numbers x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) # calculate the mean of the vector mean(x) The output of this code is 3, which is the mean of the vector x (i.e. the sum of the elements divided by the number of elements). R Interview Questions In this example, we did not specify the na.rm and trim arguments, so the default values of FALSE and 0 were used, respectively. This means that no missing values were removed from the calculation, and no observations were trimmed from the vector before calculating the mean. We can also use the mean() function to calculate the mean of a vector with missing values, by setting the na.rm argument to TRUE: # create a vector of numbers with missing values x <- c(1, 2, 3, NA, 5) # calculate the mean of the vector, ignoring missing values mean(x, na.rm = TRUE) The output of this code is 2.8, which is the mean of the non-missing values in the vector x. Additionally, we can use the mean() function to calculate the mean of a vector a"
"21. Write a function in R to create a scatter plot of two given vectors of numeric data? R Interview Questions The function below creates a scatter plot of two given vectors of numeric data. It takes in two arguments: x and y, which are the vectors containing the numeric data for the x-axis and y-axis, respectively. To use the function, we simply pass in the vectors containing the numeric data for the x-axis and y-axis as arguments. For example, to create a scatter plot of the vectors x and y, we would call the function as follows: x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) y <- c(1, 4, 9, 16, 25) scatter_plot(x, y) The resulting scatter plot would show the relationship between the values in the x and y vectors, with a red regression line added to the plot to show the overall trend of the data."
"22. Write a function in R to create a histogram of a given vector of numeric data? To create a histogram of a given vector of numeric data in R, we can use the hist() function. This function takes in the vector of numeric data as the first argument, and can also take in optional arguments such as the number of bins to use in the histogram, the color and fill of the bars, and labels for the x and y axes. For example, to create a histogram of the vector x with 10 bins, filled with the color ""red"", and labeled axes, we can use the following code: scatter_plot <- function(x, y) { # Create the scatter plot using the plot() function plot(x, y, main = ""Scatter Plot"", xlab = ""x-axis data"", ylab = ""y-axis data"", pch = 1 # Add a regression line to the plot using the abline() function abline(lm(y ~ x), col = ""red"") } R Interview Questions hist(x, breaks = 10, col = ""red"", xlab = ""X values"", ylab = ""Frequency"") This will create a histogram with 10 bins, where each bin represents a range of values in the vector x, and the height of the bar in each bin represents the number of values in that range. The histogram will be filled with the color ""red"", and the x and y axes will be labeled with the provided labels. Alternatively, we can specify the bin edges directly using the breaks argument, rather than specifying the number of bins. For example, to create a histogram with the same x axis labels but with custom bin edges, we can use the following code: hist(x, breaks = c(0, 5, 10, 15, 20), col = ""red"", xlab = ""X values"", ylab = ""Frequency"") This will create a histogram with 4 bins, where the first bin represents values in the range 0 to 5, the second bin represents values in the range 5 to 10, and so on. The histogram will again be filled with the color ""red"", and the x and y axes will be labeled with the provided labels. Overall, the hist() function is a useful tool for visualizing the distribution of numeric data in a vector, and can be customized with various arguments to suit the specific needs of the data."
"23. Write a function in R to generate random numbers from a specified distribution? To generate random numbers from a specified distribution in R, we can use the r function from the stats package. This function takes the name of the distribution as its first argument, followed by any necessary parameters for that distribution. R Interview Questions For example, to generate random numbers from a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, we can use the following code: # Load the stats package library(stats) # Generate 10 random numbers from a normal distribution random_numbers <- rnorm(n = 10, mean = 0, sd = 1) # Print the random numbers print(random_numbers) In this code, we use the rnorm function from the stats package to generate 10 random numbers from a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. We then print the resulting random numbers to the console. Alternatively, we can use the sample function from the base R package to generate random numbers from a specified distribution. This function takes a vector of values as its first argument, followed by the number of samples to generate and any necessary parameters for the distribution. For example, to generate 10 random numbers from a uniform distribution between 0 and 1, we can use the following code: # Load the base R package library(base) # Generate 10 random numbers from a uniform distribution random_numbers <- sample(x = 0:1, size = 10, replace = TRUE, prob = NULL) # Print the random numbers print(random_numbers) In this code, we use the sample function to generate 10 random numbers from a uniform distribution between 0 and 1. We specify the range of values to sample from using the x argument, and the number of samples to generate using the size argument. We set the replace and prob arguments to their default values to use a simple uniform distribution. We then print the resulting random numbers to the console. R Interview Questions"
"24. Write a function in R to calculate the standard deviation of a given vector of numbers? To calculate the standard deviation of a vector of numbers in R, we can use the built- in function sd(). This function takes a vector of numbers as input and returns the standard deviation of the numbers in the vector. Here is an example of how to use this function: # Create a vector of numbers numbers <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) # Calculate the standard deviation of the numbers sd(numbers) This code creates a vector of numbers and then calculates the standard deviation of those numbers using the sd() function. The result of this calculation is printed on the screen. The standard deviation is a measure of how much the numbers in a vector diﬀer from the mean of the numbers. It is calculated by taking the square root of the sum of the squares of the diﬀerences between each number and the mean, divided by the number of numbers in the vector. This allows us to see how far the numbers are spread out from the mean and can help us identify any outliers or unusual values in the data. The sd() function in R is a convenient and easy way to calculate the standard deviation of a vector of numbers. It can be used in a variety of data analysis and statistical modelling tasks and can be combined with other functions and tools in R to perform more complex analyses and calculations."

"26. Write a function in R to create a bar plot of a given vector of categorical data? To create a bar plot of a given vector of categorical data in R, we can use the function barplot(). The function takes the vector as an input and creates a bar plot showing the frequency of each category in the vector. Here is an example of how to use the barplot() function in R: # Create a vector of categorical data data <- c(""cat"", ""dog"", ""bird"", ""cat"", ""dog"", ""bird"", ""bird"") # Create a bar plot of the vector barplot(data) In this example, the barplot() function creates a bar plot showing the frequency of each category in the vector. The plot shows that there are two ""cat"" values, two ""dog"" values, and three ""bird"" values in the vector. R Interview Questions We can also customize the bar plot by adding labels, changing the colors of the bars, and changing the width of the bars. Here is an example of how to customize the bar plot: # Create a vector of categorical data data <- c(""cat"", ""dog"", ""bird"", ""cat"", ""dog"", ""bird"", ""bird"") # Create a bar plot of the vector barplot(data, main = ""Frequency of Animal Types"", # Add a title to the plot xlab = ""Animal Type"", # Add a label for the x-axis ylab = ""Frequency"", # Add a label for the y-axis col = c(""red"", ""blue"", ""green""), # Change the colors of the bars width = 0.5) # Change the width of the bars In this example, the barplot() function creates a bar plot with customized labels, colors, and bar widths. The plot shows the frequency of each category in the vector and provides clear labels for the axes and the bars."
"27. Write a function in R to calculate the covariance between two given vectors of numeric data? To calculate the covariance between two vectors of numeric data in R, we can use the cov function from the stats package. The cov function takes two arguments: the first is the first vector of numeric data and the second is the second vector of numeric data. Here is an example of using the cov function to calculate the covariance between two vectors of numeric data: R Interview Questions # Load the stats package library(stats) # Define the first vector of numeric data vec1 <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) # Define the second vector of numeric data vec2 <- c(10, 20, 30, 40, 50) # Calculate the covariance between the two vectors cov(vec1, vec2) The output of this code will be the covariance between the two vectors. The covariance is a measure of how two variables are related. A positive covariance indicates that the two variables are positively correlated, while a negative covariance indicates that the two variables are negatively correlated. A covariance of zero indicates that the two variables are independent. In this example, the covariance between the two vectors is likely to be positive, since both vectors are increasing in the same direction. This indicates that there is a positive relationship between the two variables represented by the vectors."
"28. Write a function in R to impute missing values in a given data frame? The following function imputes missing values in a given data frame by replacing the missing values with the mean of the non-missing values in the column: R Interview Questions # Function to impute missing values impute_missing <- function(data) { # Loop through each column in the data frame for(col in colnames(data)) { # Calculate the mean of the non-missing values in the column col_mean <- mean(data[,col], na.rm = TRUE) # Replace missing values in the column with the calculated mean data[is.na(data[,col]), col] <- col_mean } # Return the updated data frame with imputed missing values return(data) } To use the function, simply pass in the data frame as an argument: # Impute missing values in the data frame imputed_data <- impute_missing(data) The function will replace the missing values in the data frame with the mean of the non-missing values in each column. This method of imputing missing values is useful when there are relatively few missing values in the data and the distribution of the values in the column is approximately normal.

"34. Explain the concept of clustering and classification in R? R Interview Questions Clustering and classification are two closely related techniques used in data mining and machine learning to analyze and understand large datasets. Clustering is a technique that involves grouping data points into clusters or groups based on their similarity or distance to one another. This allows us to identify patterns and relationships within the data and to understand the underlying structure of the dataset. For example, we may cluster a dataset of customers based on their purchasing behavior, and use this information to create targeted marketing campaigns. Classification, on the other hand, involves assigning data points to predefined categories or classes based on their characteristics or features. This allows us to predict the class or category that a new data point belongs to based on its features. For example, we may use a classification algorithm to predict whether a customer will make a purchase based on their demographic information and past purchasing behavior. In R, there are several packages and functions available for performing clustering and classification, including the kmeans() and kmeans() functions for clustering, and the lm() and glm() functions for classification.

"36. Explain parallel computing in R and how to use it? Parallel computing in R refers to the ability of the programming language to distribute computational tasks across multiple processors or cores in a computer. This allows for faster and more eﬀicient processing of large datasets and complex algorithms. To use parallel computing in R, the user first needs to have a computer with multiple processors or cores. They can then use the parallel package in R to create a cluster of workers, which are the individual processors or cores that will be used for parallel computation. Once the cluster is created, the user can use the parallel version of common R functions, such as lapply and apply, to distribute the computation across the cluster. This can be done by specifying the cluster object as an argument in the function call. For example, to use parallel computing to apply a function to a large dataset, the user can use the parLapply function, which is the parallel version of lapply, as follows: cluster <- makeCluster(detectCores()) # create cluster of workers result <- parLapply(cluster, dataset, myFunction) # distribute computation across clust stopCluster(cluster) # stop cluster after computation is done R Interview Questions In this example, the makeCluster function is used to create a cluster of workers using the number of cores detected on the computer. The parLapply function is then used to distribute the computation of the myFunction function on the dataset across the cluster. The result of the computation is stored in the result object, and the cluster is stopped a"

DOS (Disk Operating System): It is basically an OS that runs from a hard disk drive. It was the first OS system used by IBM-compatible computers. It basically provides a command-line in which users are allowed to give instructions in the form of commands. BASH DOS In BASH, commands are case-sensitive. In DOS, commands are not case- sensitive. In this, / character are directory separator and \\ acts as an escape character. In this, \\ is a directory separator and / acts as a command argument delimiter. It can take input with its built-in “read” command. It cannot take input during run time and one can only pass “/argument” during execution from the command line."

OOPs Interview Questions OOPs Interview Questions Solved Step by Step | Coding Inte OOPs Interview Questions Solved Step by Step | Coding Inte…… Basic OOPs Interview Questions
"1. What is meant by the term OOPs? OOPs refers to Object-Oriented Programming. It is the programming paradigm that is defined using objects. Objects can be considered as real-world instances of entities like class, that have some characteristics and behaviors."
"2. What is the need for OOPs? There are many reasons why OOPs is mostly preferred, but the most important among them are: OOPs helps users to understand the so"
"3. What are some major Object Oriented Programming languages? OOPs Interview Questions The programming languages that use and follow the Object-Oriented Programming paradigm or OOPs, are known as Object-Oriented Programming languages. Some of the major Object-Oriented Programming languages include: Java C++ Javascript Python PHP And many more."
"4. What are some other programming paradigms other than OOPs? Programming paradigms refers to the method of classification of programming languages based on their features. There are mainly two types of Programming Paradigms: Imperative Programming Paradigm Declarative Programming Paradigm OOPs Interview Questions Now, these paradigms can be further classified based:"
"1. Imperative Programming Paradigm: Imperative programming focuses on HOW to execute program logic and defines control flow as statements that change a program state. This can be further classified as: a) Procedural Programming Paradigm: Procedural programming specifies the steps a program must take to reach the desired state, usually read in order from top to bottom. b) Object-Oriented Programming or OOP: Object-oriented programming (OOP) organizes programs as objects, that contain some data and have some behavior. c) Parallel Programming: Parallel programming paradigm breaks a task into subtasks and focuses on executing them simultaneously at the same time."
"2. Declarative Programming Paradigm: Declarative programming focuses on WHAT to execute and defines program logic, but not a detailed control flow. Declarative paradigm can be further classified into: a) Logical Programming Paradigm: Logical programming paradigm is based on formal logic, which refers to a set of sentences expressing facts and rules about how to solve a problem b) Functional Programming Paradigm: Functional programming is a programming paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions. c) Database Programming Paradigm: Database programming model is used to manage data and information structured as fields, records, and files. OOPs Interview Questions"
"5. What is meant by Structured Programming? Structured Programming refers to the method of programming which consists of a completely structured control flow. Here structure refers to a block, which contains a set of rules, and has a definitive control flow, such as (if/then/else), (while and for), block structures, and subroutines. Nearly all programming paradigms include Structured programming, including the OOPs model."
"6. What are the main features of OOPs? OOPs or Object Oriented Programming mainly comprises of the below four features, and make sure you don't miss any of these: Inheritance Encapsulation Polymorphism Data Abstraction OOPs Interview Questions"
"7. What are some advantages of using OOPs? OOPs is very helpful in solving very complex level of problems. Highly complex programs can be created, handled, and maintained easily using object-oriented programming. OOPs, promote code reuse, thereby reducing redundancy. OOPs also helps to hide the unnecessary details with the help of Data Abstraction. OOPs, are based on a bottom-up approach, unlike the Structural programming paradigm, which uses a top-down approach. Polymorphism oﬀers a lot of flexibility in OOPs."
"8. Why is OOPs so popular? OOPs programming paradigm is considered as a better style of programming. Not only it helps in writing a complex piece of code easily, but it also allows users to handle and maintain them easily as well. Not only that, the main pillar of OOPs - Data Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism, makes it easy for programmers to solve complex scenarios. As a result of these, OOPs is so popular. Advanced OOPs Interview Questions OOPs Interview Questions"
"9. What is a class? A class can be understood as a template or a blueprint, which contains some values, known as member data or member, and some set of rules, known as behaviors or functions. So when an object is created, it automatically takes the data and functions that are defined in the class. Therefore the class is basically a template or blueprint for objects. Also one can create as many objects as they want based on a class. For example, first, a car’s template is created. Then multiple units of car are created based on that template."
"10. What is an object? An object refers to the instance of the class, which contains the instance of the members and behaviors defined in the class template. In the real world, an object is an actual entity to which a user interacts, whereas class is just the blueprint for that object. So the objects consume space and have some characteristic behavior. For example, a specific car."
"11. What is encapsulation? OOPs Interview Questions One can visualize Encapsulation as the method of putting everything that is required to do the job, inside a capsule and presenting that capsule to the user. What it means is that by Encapsulation, all the necessary data and methods are bind together and all the unnecessary details are hidden to the normal user. So Encapsulation is the process of binding data members and methods of a program together to do a specific job, without revealing unnecessary details. Encapsulation can also be defined in two diﬀerent ways: 1) Data hiding: Encapsulation is the process of hiding unwanted information, such as restricting access to any member of an object. 2) Data binding: Encapsulation is the process of binding the data members and the methods together as a whole, as a class."
"12. What is Polymorphism? Polymorphism is composed of two words - “poly” which means “many”, and “morph” which means “shapes”. Therefore Polymorphism refers to something that has many shapes. OOPs Interview Questions In OOPs, Polymorphism refers to the process by which some code, data, method, or object behaves diﬀerently under diﬀerent circumstances or contexts. Compile-time polymorphism and Run time polymorphism are the two types of polymorphisms in OOPs languages."
"13. What is Compile time Polymorphism and how is it diﬀerent from Runtime Polymorphism? Compile Time Polymorphism: Compile time polymorphism, also known as Static Polymorphism, refers to the type of Polymorphism that happens at compile time. What it means is that the compiler decides what shape or value has to be taken by the entity in the picture. Example: OOPs Interview Questions // In this program, we will see how multiple functions are created with the same name, // but the compiler decides which function to call easily at the compile time itself. class CompileTimePolymorphism{ // 1st method with name add public int add(int x, int y){ return x+y; } // 2nd method with name add public int add(int x, int y, int z){ return x+y+z; } // 3rd method with name add public int add(double x, int y){ return (int)x+y; } // 4th method with name add public int add(int x, double y){ return x+(int)y; } } class Test{ public static void main(String[] args){ CompileTimePolymorphism demo=new CompileTimePolymorphism(); // In the below statement, the Compiler looks at the argument types and decides to c System.out.println(demo.add(2,3)); // Similarly, in the below statement, the compiler calls method 2 System.out.println(demo.add(2,3,4)); // Similarly, in the below statement, the compiler calls method 4 System.out.println(demo.add(2,3.4)); // Similarly, in the below statement, the compiler calls method 3 System.out.println(demo.add(2.5,3)); } } OOPs Interview Questions In the above example, there are four versions of add methods. The first method takes two parameters while the second one takes three. For the third and fourth methods, there is a change of order of parameters. The compiler looks at the method signature and decides which method to invoke for a particular method call at compile time. Runtime Polymorphism: Runtime polymorphism, also known as Dynamic Polymorphism, refers to the type of Polymorphism that happens at the run time. What it means is it can't be decided by the compiler. Therefore what shape or value has to be taken depends upon the execution. Hence the name Runtime Polymorphism. Example: As the method to call is determined at runtime, as shown in the above code, this is called runtime polymorphism."
"14. How does C++ support Polymorphism? C++ is an Object-oriented programming language and it supports Polymorphism as well: class AnyVehicle{ public void move(){ System.out.println(“Any vehicle should move!!”); } } class Bike extends AnyVehicle{ public void move(){ System.out.println(“Bike can move too!!”); } } class Test{ public static void main(String[] args){ AnyVehicle vehicle = new Bike(); // In the above statement, as you can see, the object vehicle is of type AnyVehicle // But the output of the below statement will be “Bike can move too!!”, // because the actual implementation of object ‘vehicle’ is decided during runtime v vehicle = new AnyVehicle(); // Now, the output of the below statement will be “Any vehicle should move!!”, vehicle.move(); } } OOPs Interview Questions Compile Time Polymorphism: C++ supports compile-time polymorphism with the help of features like templates, function overloading, and default arguments. Runtime Polymorphism: C++ supports Runtime polymorphism with the help of features like virtual functions. Virtual functions take the shape of the functions based on the type of object in reference and are resolved at runtime."
"15. What is meant by Inheritance? The term “inheritance” means “receiving some quality or behavior from a parent to an oﬀspring.” In object-oriented programming, inheritance is the mechanism by which an object or class (referred to as a child) is created using the definition of another object or class (referred to as a parent). Inheritance not only helps to keep the implementation simpler but also helps to facilitate code reuse."
"16. What is Abstraction? If you are a user, and you have a problem statement, you don't want to know how the components of the so"
"17. How much memory does a class occupy? Classes do not consume any memory. They are just a blueprint based on which objects are created. Now when objects are created, they actually initialize the class members and methods and therefore consume memory."
"18. Is it always necessary to create objects from class? No. An object is necessary to be created if the base class has non-static methods. But if the class has static methods, then objects don’t need to be created. You can call the class method directly in this case, using the class name."
"19. What is a constructor? OOPs Interview Questions Constructors are special methods whose name is the same as the class name. The constructors serve the special purpose of initializing the objects. For example, suppose there is a class with the name “MyClass”, then when you instantiate this class, you pass the syntax: MyClass myClassObject = new MyClass(); Now here, the method called a"
20. What are the various types of constructors in C++? The most common classification of constructors includes: Default constructor: The default constructor is the constructor which doesn’t take any argument. It has no parameters. OOPs Interview Questions class ABC { int x; ABC() { x = 0; } } Parameterized constructor: The constructors that take some arguments are known as parameterized constructors. class ABC { int x; ABC(int y) { x = y; } } Copy constructor: A copy constructor is a member function that initializes an object using another object of the same class. class ABC { int x; ABC(int y) { x = y; } // Copy constructor ABC(ABC abc) { x = abc.x; } }
"21. What is a copy constructor? OOPs Interview Questions Copy Constructor is a type of constructor, whose purpose is to copy an object to another. What it means is that a copy constructor will clone an object and its values, into another object, is provided that both the objects are of the same class."
"22. What is a destructor? Contrary to constructors, which initialize objects and specify space for them, Destructors are also special methods. But destructors free up the resources and memory occupied by an object. Destructors are automatically called when an object is being destroyed."
"23. Are class and structure the same? If not, what's the diﬀerence between a class and a structure? No, class and structure are not the same. Though they appear to be similar, they have diﬀerences that make them apart. For example, the structure is saved in the stack memory, whereas the class is saved in the heap memory. Also, Data Abstraction cannot be achieved with the help of structure, but with class, Abstraction is majorly used."
"24. Explain Inheritance with an example? Inheritance is one of the major features of object-oriented programming, by which an entity inherits some characteristics and behaviors of some other entity and makes them their own. Inheritance helps to improve and facilitate code reuse. Let me explain to you with a common example. Let's take three diﬀerent vehicles - a car, truck, or bus. These three are entirely diﬀerent from one another with their own specific characteristics and behavior. But. in all three, you will find some common elements, like steering wheel, accelerator, clutch, brakes, etc. Though these elements are used in diﬀerent vehicles, still they have their own features which are common among all vehicles. This is achieved with inheritance. The car, the truck, and the bus have all inherited the features like steering wheel, accelerator, clutch, brakes, etc, and used them as their own. Due to this, they did not have to create these components from scratch, thereby facilitating code reuse. OOPs Interview Questions"
"25. Are there any limitations of Inheritance? Yes, with more powers comes more complications. Inheritance is a very powerful feature in OOPs, but it has some limitations too. Inheritance needs more time to process, as it needs to navigate through multiple classes for its implementation. Also, the classes involved in Inheritance - the base class and the child class, are very tightly coupled together. So if one needs to make some changes, they might need to do nested changes in both classes. Inheritance might be complex for implementation, as well. So if not correctly implemented, this might lead to unexpected errors or incorrect outputs."
26. What are the various types of inheritance? The various types of inheritance include: Single inheritance Multiple inheritances Multi-level inheritance Hierarchical inheritance Hybrid inheritance OOPs Interview Questions
"27. What is a subclass? The subclass is a part of Inheritance. The subclass is an entity, which inherits from another class. It is also known as the child class."
"28. Define a superclass? Superclass is also a part of Inheritance. The superclass is an entity, which allows subclasses or child classes to inherit from itself. OOPs Interview Questions"
"29. What is an interface? An interface refers to a special type of class, which contains methods, but not their definition. Only the declaration of methods is allowed inside an interface. To use an interface, you cannot create objects. Instead, you need to implement that interface and define the methods for their implementation."
30. What is meant by static polymorphism? Static Polymorphism is commonly known as the Compile time polymorphism. Static polymorphism is the feature by which an object is linked with the respective function or operator based on the values during the compile time. Static or Compile time Polymorphism can be achieved through Method overloading or operator overloading.
"31. What is meant by dynamic polymorphism? Dynamic Polymorphism or Runtime polymorphism refers to the type of Polymorphism in OOPs, by which the actual implementation of the function is decided during the runtime or execution. The dynamic or runtime polymorphism can be achieved with the help of method overriding."
"32. What is the diﬀerence between overloading and overriding? OOPs Interview Questions Overloading is a compile-time polymorphism feature in which an entity has multiple implementations with the same name. For example, Method overloading and Operator overloading. Whereas Overriding is a runtime polymorphism feature in which an entity has the same name, but its implementation changes during execution. For example, Method overriding. Image"
33. How is data abstraction accomplished? Data abstraction is accomplished with the help of abstract methods or abstract classes.
"34. What is an abstract class? An abstract class is a special class containing abstract methods. The significance of abstract class is that the abstract methods inside it are not implemented and only declared. So as a result, when a subclass inherits the abstract class and needs to use its abstract methods, they need to define and implement them."
"35. How is an abstract class diﬀerent from an interface? Interface and abstract class both are special types of classes that contain only the methods declaration and not their implementation. But the interface is entirely diﬀerent from an abstract class. The main diﬀerence between the two is that, when an interface is implemented, the subclass must define all its methods and provide its implementation. Whereas when an abstract class is inherited, the subclass does not need to provide the definition of its abstract method, until and unless the subclass is using it. Also, an abstract class can contain abstract methods as well as non-abstract methods."
"36. What are access specifiers and what is their significance? OOPs Interview Questions Access specifiers, as the name suggests, are a special type of keywords, which are used to control or specify the accessibility of entities like classes, methods, etc. Some of the access specifiers or access modifiers include “private”, “public”, etc. These access specifiers also play a very vital role in achieving Encapsulation - one of the major features of OOPs."
"37. What is an exception? An exception can be considered as a special event, which is raised during the execution of a program at runtime, that brings the execution to a halt. The reason for the exception is mainly due to a position in the program, where the user wants to do something for which the program is not specified, like undesirable input."
38. What is meant by exception handling? No one wants its so
"39. What is meant by Garbage Collection in OOPs world? Object-oriented programming revolves around entities like objects. Each object consumes memory and there can be multiple objects of a class. So if these objects and their memories are not handled properly, then it might lead to certain memory- related errors and the system might fail. Garbage collection refers to this mechanism of handling the memory in the program. Through garbage collection, the unwanted memory is freed up by removing the objects that are no longer needed."
"40. Can we run a Java application without implementing the OOPs concept? No. Java applications are based on Object-oriented programming models or OOPs concept, and hence they cannot be implemented without it. OOPs Interview Questions However, on the other hand, C++ can be implemented without OOPs, as it also supports the C-like structural programming model. OOPs Coding Problems"
"41. What is the output of the below code? #include<iostream> using namespace std; class BaseClass1 { public: BaseClass1() { cout << "" BaseClass1 constructor called"" << endl; } }; class BaseClass2 { public: BaseClass2() { cout << ""BaseClass2 constructor called"" << endl; } }; class DerivedClass: public BaseClass1, public BaseClass2 { public: DerivedClass() { cout << ""DerivedClass constructor called"" << endl; } }; int main() { DerivedClass derived_class; return 0; } Output: BaseClass1 constructor called BaseClass2 constructor called DerivedClass constructor called OOPs Interview Questions Reason: The above program demonstrates Multiple inheritances. So when the Derived class’s constructor is called, it automatically calls the Base class's constructors from le"
"42. What will be the output of the below code? class Scaler { static int i; static { System.out.println(“a”); i = 100; } } public class StaticBlock { static { System.out.println(“b”); } public static void main(String[] args) { System.out.println(“c”); System.out.println(Scaler.i); } } Output: b c a 100 OOPs Interview Questions Reason: Firstly the static block inside the main-method calling class will be implemented. Hence ‘b’ will be printed first. Then the main method is called, and now the sequence is kept as expected."
"43. Predict the output? #include<iostream> using namespace std; class ClassA { public: ClassA(int ii = 0) : i(ii) {} void show() { cout << ""i = "" << i << endl;} private: int i; }; class ClassB { public: ClassB(int xx) : x(xx) {} operator ClassA() const { return ClassA(x); } private: int x; }; void g(ClassA a) { a.show(); } int main() { ClassB b(10); g(b); g(20); getchar(); return 0; } Output: i = 10 i = 20 OOPs Interview Questions Reason: ClassA contains a conversion constructor. Due to this, the objects of ClassA can have integer values. So the statement g(20) works. Also, ClassB has a conversion operator overloaded. So the statement g(b) also works."
44. What will be the output in below code? public class Demo{ public static void main(String[] arr){ System.out.println(“Main1”); } public static void main(String arr){ System.out.println(“Main2”); } } Output: Main1 Reason: Here the main() method is overloaded. But JVM only understands the main method which has a String[] argument in its definition. Hence Main1 is printed and the overloaded main method is ignored.
"45. Predict the output? OOPs Interview Questions #include<iostream> using namespace std; class BaseClass{ int arr[10]; }; class DerivedBaseClass1: public BaseClass { }; class DerivedBaseClass2: public BaseClass { }; class DerivedClass: public DerivedBaseClass1, public DerivedBaseClass2{}; int main(void) { cout<<sizeof(DerivedClass); return 0; } Output: If the size of the integer is 4 bytes, then the output will be 80. Reason: Since DerivedBaseClass1 and DerivedBaseClass1 both inherit from class BaseClass, DerivedClass contains two copies of BaseClass. Hence it results in wastage of space and a large size output. It can be reduced with the help of a virtual base class."
"Quality Control(QC) Interview Questions What does it take to become a good quality control specialist? It is true that every interview is diﬀerent depending on the job profile. Likewise, if you are applying for a quality control job, make sure you prepare our comprehensive set of QC questions. Before we begin, let's first determine what exactly is so"
1. Explain the advantages and disadvantages of So
"2. Explain the role of a quality control specialist. Quality Control(QC) Interview Questions The following are some of the roles a quality control engineer or specialist must perform: Develop, implement, and improve quality control processes and procedures. Ensure that quality control processes are aligned with commercial objectives in collaboration with senior managers. Prepare comprehensive, well-structured, and detailed test plans and cases. Analyze operations from a QC perspective. Perform quality control inspections. Perform statistical analysis from a QC perspective to identify issues, trends, and defects. Foster a culture where employees are empowered to report quality control issues or defects without fear of retribution or blame. Consult with managers and team members about inspection results. Make sure there is a procedure for removing failed products. Keep up with new testing strategies and tools, etc."
3. What are the qualities or skills needed to be successful in quality control? Maintaining the quality of the products during production is the responsibility of the quality control specialist. So
4. In So
5. What are the stages or phases of a standard quality control procedure? So
"6. Which types of testing are performed during the Quality Control process? Unit testing, functional testing, and integration testing are types of testing performed as part of Quality Control processes. Furthermore, there are several other types of testing that can contribute to quality control, such as System Integration Testing, User Acceptance Testing, Non-Functional Testing, Beta Testing, Regression Testing, Performance Testing, Volume Testing, Installation Testing, Recovery Testing, Load Testing, Stress Testing, and Usability Testing."
"7. What are the artifacts you include when writing test cases? Quality Control(QC) Interview Questions When writing test cases, there are seven main artifacts that can be considered such as requirement understanding documents, functional requirement specification, user stories, use cases, acceptance criteria, wireframes, and UAT test cases. You should strive to include all relevant artifacts whenever they are applicable to the product we are testing."
"8. What is a good test case? Generally, a test case consists of a set of conditions, variables, and/or actions being performed on a system under test to ensure it meets its requirements and functions properly. Good test cases include: Clear Objective: Specify the intent and scope of the test. Meaningful pass/fail verifications: Specifying what constitutes success and failure and how to determine both.' Clear and concise documentation: Prepare standardized formats for your test cases, including unique ID number, descriptions, preconditions, related datasets, and expected outcomes. Traceability to requirements: Test cases should be traceable to requirements for a system under test. We need to ensure we test all requirements and changes, and not waste time testing irrelevant components. Reusability: Develop test cases that are modular and easy to maintain. It is likely that test cases will change as the system under test evolves over time, but we definitely want to write test cases that are reusable as long as possible. Testing of one test case independently of others: Execution of a single test case should not be dependent on other test cases. To create a larger end-to-end test, your independent, modular test cases should be able to be combined into sequential or parallel execution test suites."
"9. Explain bug leakage and bug release. Quality Control(QC) Interview Questions Bug Leakage: When an application encounters a bug that should have been detected in earlier versions or builds, this is called bug leakage. The tester is unaware of the defect during testing, which is eventually discovered by the tester/end-user. Bug Release: A bug release is when an application or so"
"10. What do you mean by branch testing? The testing of all the branches of a code, which is done at once, is called branch testing. This technique enables every possible branch from every decision point to be executed at least once, ensuring that all reachable code is executed. As part of branch testing, each outcome from a code module is tested as a binary outcome, so you must test both True and False outcomes. Branch Testing provides some features that are generally useful for a so"
"11. Can you explain boundary testing? The Boundary value analysis, also known as boundary testing, is a so"
12. How can you minimize so
"13. What do you consider to be the most important quality measures? Quality Control(QC) Interview Questions Every organization will have its own measure of quality that matters most, from safety to speed, compliance to cost. Safety is the most important of all quality measures because, without it, all of the others are meaningless. For consumers to trust us and buy from us, our products must be safe. If the products are not safe, consumers will stop buying from us, which can lead to expensive litigation."
"14. State diﬀerences between product quality and process quality. Product quality is directly impacted by the quality of production processes. Consequently, a quality control manager's duties include inspecting both a company's products and its processes. Product quality: The purpose of product quality inspections is to detect defects and assess how closely a product conforms to requirements specifications. Process quality: The purpose of a process quality inspection is to identify ineﬀiciencies in the production process that waste organization time, slow down the process, or lead to lower-quality products."
"15. What is the importance of standards in quality control? The concept of quality isn't just about profits and losses or beating out your competitors. This is about delivering on a promise, meeting the basic expectations of customers and ensuring product safety. However, companies that meet quality standards o"
"16. Describe the characteristics of Quality Control. Quality control entails several specific characteristics, including: Adopting a diﬀerent set of processes. To deliver a high-quality product. Providing quality products to customers at an aﬀordable price. Improving quality by implementing processes from diﬀerent organizations and standards. To ensure proper execution of the test plan. Make sure the execution is planned with the proper review process. The eﬀectiveness and eﬀiciency with which a product or system can be modified in order to improve, correct, or adapt to a changing environment."
17. Describe the characteristics of Quality Control provided by ISO standards? Diﬀerent standards are developed and implemented by organizations around the world to improve so
"18. Explain PDCA Model. PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Action) model/cycle is also known as PDSA ( Plan-Do-Study- Act), the ""Deming Wheel,"" and ""Shewhart Cycle"". A PDCA cycle fosters the methodical, rigorous implementation of solutions to problems. It is a four-step process that assists teams in avoiding recurring mistakes and improving development processes. In the same way that a circle is infinite, PDCA should be repeated indefinitely to improve continuously. Quality Control(QC) Interview Questions Quality Control(QC) Interview Questions Plan: The first step is to identify and understand your opportunity or problem, and then plan how to proceed. Planning takes a significant amount of your team's time, depending on the project's size. A proper plan usually consists of smaller steps so that there is a lower possibility of failure. Do: Once you have agreed on a plan, it is time to take action. In this step, you put into practice all the things you considered in the previous stage. At this stage, unforeseen problems can occur. In an ideal scenario, you should first test your plan on a small scale and in a controlled environment. Check: If you wish to develop a clear plan, avoid making the same mistakes, and use continuous improvement eﬀectively, you should pay close attention to the check phase. You need to examine your plan's execution result and determine whether it was successful. Moreover, your team will be capable of identifying problematic parts of the current process and eliminating them in the future. Try experimenting with more changes, and repeat the Do and Check phases. If something goes wrong during the process, you need to figure out the problem's root cause. In any case, if your original plan doesn't work, you ought to start over with the planning phase. Act: The previous steps were to develop, apply, and check your plan. Now it's time to act. As long as everything appears to be working well and your team was successful in achieving the original goals, you can proceed and implement your original plan. In this instance, your PDCA model becomes your new benchmark. Whenever you repeat a standardized plan, ask your team to go through all steps again and improve the care."
19. What quality control factors help to ensure the quality of products and systems? In determining the so
20. List the diﬀerent so
"21. Which tools do testers use during QC tests? OR What is your favourite QC tool? Quality control specialists leverage a variety of tools for analytics, compliance monitoring, customer satisfaction management, and more. New technology is introduced every year, but some tools have become industry standards. In the long run, quality control specialists must be flexible and willing to learn new technology. Almost all quality control managers and specialists have their preferred methods or tools for inspecting quality. Seven main tools for quality control are Pareto chart (80/20 Rule), Stratification (Divide and Conquer), Cause-and-eﬀect diagram (“fishbone” or Ishikawa diagram), Scatter diagram (Shewhart Chart), Check Sheet (Tally Sheet), Histogram, and Control chart. Known as the Seven Basic Tools of Quality, these tools could be applied by anyone with a very basic understanding of statistics and were simple to apply to resolve quality-related complex issues. Good candidates should be able to explain the tools that they use most frequently. Quality Control(QC) Interview Questions"
"22. State diﬀerence between load testing and stress testing. Load testing and system testing are among the most common types of quality control testing. Load testing: Performing load tests will allow you to understand how a system will perform under real-life load conditions. Load testing measures how well a system performs for example when it experiences high demand, such as multiple users at the same time. Stress testing: A stress test is meant to determine the maximum capacity of a system under heavy load conditions such as Slashdot eﬀect, DDoS attack, or other scenarios. The test verifies the system's reliability and stability."
"23. What are the top Quality Management Principles (QMP) that should be focused on? Following are a few of the most important quality management principles to focus on: Quality Control(QC) Interview Questions Customer Focus: Quality management aims to meet and exceed the needs or expectations of customers. Leadership: Leaders create a sense of unity and commitment among staﬀ and ensure that the quality objectives of an organization are met. Engagement of People: A thriving organization requires people who are empowered, competent, and engaged to deliver value. A high-performing, empowered and engaged workforce enhances the organization's ability to create value.] Process Approach: By understanding and managing activities as interconnected processes that function as a cohesive system, we can achieve more predictable and consistent results more eﬀectively. Improvement: Improved performance is a priority for successful organizations. A continuous focus on improvement is therefore crucial. Evidence-based Decision Making: Data-driven decisions have a better chance of producing the desired results than those based on guesswork and intuition. Results are more likely to be achieved when decisions are made based on data analysis and evaluation. Relationship Management: Organizations must manage their relationships with stakeholders, such as suppliers, for sustained success."
"24. What should be covered in a process qualification? Process qualification ensures your manufacturing processes are able to produce a certain volume consistently over time. In the absence of these, production processes will break down, leading to missed deadlines and unfulfilled orders. As part of the process qualification, we evaluate the facility, materials, hardware/equipment, so"
"25. Consider the situation in which we were rushing to meet a deadline, but there was a defect that prevented us from meeting that target. How would you handle it? Quality Control(QC) Interview Questions The quality control process is stressful, and it is o"

"Low Level Design Interview Questions In HLD, the focus is more on designing the high-level architecture of the system, defining the high-level components with their interactions, and also the database design. HLD converts the business requirements to a high-level solution. What is Low-Level Design (HLD)? In LLD, the focus is more on designing each component in detail such as what classes are needed, what abstractions to use, how object creation should happen, how data flows between diﬀerent objects, etc. LLD converts the high-level design into detailed design (ready to code) components. It is common nowadays to have a Low-Level Design round (or) Pair Programming round (or) Machine Coding round in tech interviews. In this article, we discuss why LLD is important, how to prepare for low-level design interview questions for freshers and experienced candidates with some examples, and finally conclude with some tips. Low Level Design Interview Questions: Freshers & Experienced"

"3. How to Solve Low-Level Design problems in Interviews? Solving an LLD problem in an interview can be done easily if we divide the solution into multiple stages and focus on solving these stages one by one. LLD problems can be broadly categorized into 2 types: Standalone applications, and web applications. Solving an LLD problem can be divided into mainly 3 stages:"
"1. Clarify & Gather Requirements: The low-level design interview questions are intentionally open-ended/ unstructured similar to real-life conditions. Ask the relevant questions regarding the problem (good questions are the ones that help to understand more about the system behaviour, features, and what features are expected to be added to the system in the future) and gather the complete requirements of the system. Don't assume anything beforehand and always clarify with the interview the assumptions you want to take. Write down the requirements & assumptions and discuss them with the interviewer. Low Level Design Interview Questions"
"2. Class Diagram & Use Case Diagram & Schema Diagram (If required): Once the requirements are gathered, define the core classes and objects, how the diﬀerent classes interact with each other, and actors who interact with the system, the use cases for each actor, etc. Draw the class diagram and use a case diagram (can be optional, ask the interviewer) for the system. Define the relations between classes by observing the interactions between them. If Class Diagram & Use Case Diagram helps in representing the requirements of systems and the relationship between diﬀerent classes, a Schema Diagram (also called an ER Diagram) helps in how the data models look and how to store the data in the database. Interviewers may not ask to write the code to store the data in the actual database but they may be interested in how the model looks like and the relationship between them. It is easy to create the Schema Diagram from the Class Diagram. Each class in the class diagram becomes a table in Schema Diagram and the relationship between classes becomes the multiplicity between tables."
"3. Code: Finally once the thoughts are structured using Class Diagram, Use Case Diagram, and Schema Diagram (if required), the Candidate can start writing the code. Apply the Design Patterns, Object-Oriented Principles & SOLID Principles wherever is possible to make the system reusable, extensible, and maintainable. Make sure the code is well structured and follow the clean coding practices to make the classes and method clean. Don't try to fit design patterns to code but check if a given problem can be solved using any available design pattern. Take care of the readability of code while taking care of all of the above.

Regression testing: This process is conducted once a so
"7. Explain Adhoc testing. The term Adhoc Testing, also known as random testing, generally refers to a type of testing that occurs without proper planning or documentation. Adhoc testing has No documentation No Test cases No Test Design Functional Testing Interview Questions Ad hoc testing is usually performed randomly without documentation or testing design and it is usually unplanned. Ad hoc Testing does not adhere to any particular structure and is done randomly on any part of the application to identify defects/bugs. When time is limited and exhaustive testing cannot be performed, adhoc testing may be conducted. The tester needs to have a thorough understanding of the system under test in order to conduct eﬀective adhoc testing. Example: Adhoc testing is cost-eﬀective and can save you a lot of time; one example would be when the client needs the product by 4 PM today, but the development will be finished by 2 PM. With only 2 hours to work with, the developer and tester team can test the system as a whole by taking some random inputs and checking for bugs."

"11. What are the diﬀerent Test Techniques used in Functional testing? Functional testing involves two distinct test techniques, which can be defined as follows: Requirement based testing: This type of testing prioritizes the requirements based on risk factors. Furthermore, this will ensure that all critical test paths are covered in the testing process. Business process-based testing: This type of functional testing examines the business process. Testing scenarios are based on knowledge of the business process. Examples include service delivery and deployment, etc."
"12. Explain risk-based testing and what important factors are needed to be considered in risk-based testing. Risk-based testing refers to the process of prioritizing tests according to risk, which is used as a basis for developing a Test Strategy. An organization can use risk-based testing (RBT) to prioritize testing so"
"13. Explain equivalence partitioning. Equivalence Partitioning is also called Equivalence Class Partitioning (ECP) and is a form of black-box testing. In this method, input domain data is divided into equivalence classes (partitions) and test cases are derived using these classes of data. Then, while testing, one sample value is picked from each class. By using this method, test cases are generally reduced to a finite set of testable cases that still cover the maximum requirements. Functional Testing Interview Questions A technique of equivalence partitioning is applied only when input data values can be divided into ranges. For each range partition, only one condition will be tested, assuming that all other conditions within the same partition will behave similarly. Example: Let's say you have an input field that can accept only percentage values between 50 and 90%. In that case, it would be pointless to write thousands of test cases for 50-90 valid input numbers, plus others for invalid data. The Equivalence Partitioning method outlined above can be used to divide test cases into three classes of input data. Each test case represents a class. As you can see, in the example provided above, we were able to split our test cases into three equivalence classes (can be more) composed of invalid and valid inputs. Test cases for input box accepting percentages between 50 and 90 using equivalence partitioning: The valid partition: Between 50%-90% (The expectation is that the text field would handle all input percentages between 50%-90%, the same way). The first invalid partition: <=50% (We’d expect the text field to reject all values greater than or equal to 50%). The second invalid partition: >= 90% (We’d expect the text field to reject all values greater than or equal to 90%). Functional Testing Interview Questions"
"14. What do you mean by boundary value analysis? The boundary value analysis is a technique for testing the boundary value of an equivalence class partition. A boundary value analysis identifies errors at the boundaries, opposed to within ranges in equivalence partitioning. Example: Consider an input field in an application that can accept a minimum of 5 characters and a maximum of 10 characters. We were able to split our test cases into three equivalence classes composed of invalid and valid input. Then 5-10 is considered as valid and <4 and >10 is considered as invalid. Test cases for application input field accepting numbers between 5-10 using boundary value analysis: The valid partition: Between values 5-10 (For this test case, we will use the same test data as the input boundaries of the input domain, namely values 5 and 10). The first invalid partition: <5 (The test data value for this case will be just below the edge/boundary of the input domain, i.e., value 4). The second invalid partition: >10 (The test data value for this case will be just above the edge/boundary of the input domain, i.e., value 11)."

What is RTM (Requirement Traceability Matrix) Functional Testing Interview Questions The Requirement Traceability Matrix, or RTM, is a tool that keeps track of requirements as a system or application progress through a testing process. As soon as the requirements document is received, the RTM is created and maintained until the system or application is released. RTM is used to ensure that all requirements in the requirements specification have been implemented before the release of the system."

"25. Why automate functional tests? What should we look for while choosing the right automation tool? Automating functional tests can certainly save time and eﬀort. Testing can be done continuously without human intervention. Furthermore, human errors can be reduced, which prevents bugs from slipping through the test phase. It is especially useful during the development phase because it helps you find bugs and problems earlier, increasing your team's eﬀiciency. As there are various automation tools available, it is essential to identify the right automation tool for the job. Now the question is how do you choose the right automation tool? The following points should be taken into account when choosing an automation tool. Functional Testing Interview Questions All members of your QA team should be able to use the tool easily. It must be able to operate in diﬀerent environments seamlessly. The tool should support the reusability of test cases in case the UI is changed. Ensure that it has features specific to your team's needs. If, for instance, your testing team needs specific reporting or logging, or if it needs to use diﬀerent scripting languages, then the tool must have these features as well."

"27. How should Test Cases be written? What are the important points to consider? Having understood what functional test cases are, let's take a look at how they're written. Below is a list of points you should consider while writing test cases: Functional Testing Interview Questions The first step is to have a broad overview of the testing project and determine what should be tested. Now it’s time to write the test cases. Before writing test cases, it is important to understand the client's requirements clearly. According to the requirement document specifications, every functional and nonfunctional requirement should be covered, from UI interfaces to compatibility. Normally, a traceability matrix is maintained to ensure that all requirements are implemented and tested. It is a good idea to periodically check test cases to ensure that they are not redundant. While writing a test case, priority is an important consideration. In this way, the tester is able to begin testing the application with the high priority test cases, followed by the medium and then the low priority test cases. Test cases should be written in a simple language and in a structure that is easy to understand. For test cases, the input data values should be valid and within a wide range."
"28. List out some examples of functional test cases. Here is an example of functional test cases: The new task to be assigned: Consider the case of assigning a new task to an appropriate user. Description: Create a new task and assign it to an appropriate user. Preconditions: When the user gets assigned, he/she should be enabled to receive email notifications. Steps: Create two separate user profiles, each with an email address. Create a new task using one of the accounts. Assign the task to your other user account. Expected result: The user should receive an email confirming that they are assigned a task. Functional Testing Interview Questions"
"29. What are some possible login features that need to be tested in any Web application? Listed below are the possible scenarios you can use to test an application's login feature: Input fields, such as username and password, should be validated both with valid and invalid values. You can also try entering a valid email address with an incorrect/invalid password, as well as entering an invalid email address with a valid password. Verify that a proper error message appears. Get logged in to the application by entering valid credentials. Check if you are still logged in by closing and reopening the browser. Once the user has logged in, navigate again to the login page to see whether he or she needs to log in again. If you are signed in through one browser, open the application through another browser to verify that you are signed in through the other browser. You should change your password a"
"30. What is the best way to ensure functional test cases cover all product areas? The most likely scenario is that you need to conduct regression testing in order to cover parts of the product that may be impacted by any new updates or product releases. The tester, in addition to testing the product's core features or functionality, should also list any areas that are aﬀected by this function or prone to breaking due to high usage and complexity of coding. In order to get a fresh perspective on test coverage, test cycles should be scheduled over two or three days. When strategizing and writing test cases, testers should open the app so they can ensure they aren't overlooking a function or feature they would have missed otherwise."

"4. Can you explain data structures and also describe the physical data structure and logical data structure? SRE Interview Questions Data structures are a set of rules for organizing and storing data in a computer. Data structures are used to structure databases, manage memory, and organize data. Data structures allow for easy organization of data, easy retrieval of data, and eﬀicient use of resources. Physical Data Structures can be Arrays and Linked lists. We can call these two physical data structures because the data stored in the actual physical memory, are based on these two. An array is the collection of contiguous data elements of the same type. And the linked list is also the collection of the data elements but it may or may not be contiguous in memory. A linked list consists of nodes that store the data and also the pointer that is pointing to the next node in the memory. Logical Data Structure can be considered as all the data structures that are constructed while using the two physical data structures. The logical data structures can be stack, queue, tree, graph, etc. These data structures have only the logic and based on this logic it defines a property and stores the data using arrays and linked lists in the memory."
"5. What is cloud computing? SRE Interview Questions Cloud computing is the delivery of IT services, such as servers, storage, and so"
"6. What is DHCP, and for what is it used? DHCP stands for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol. It is a protocol that allows networks to dynamically allocate IP addresses to hosts on the network. DHCP is used to assign IP addresses to devices such as PCs and routers. When a device is installed, it may need an IP address in order to access the Internet. So when a new device is installed, it will get an IP address from DHCP so that it can connect to the network. SRE Interview Questions When a device connects to a network, it needs an IP address first so that it can communicate with other hosts on the network. And since most networks have only one IP address assigned for each device, there must be some mechanism for dynamically allocating those addresses. In order for a DHCP server to work, it must have at least two parts: an interface (usually Ethernet or WiFi) and some sort of database that stores information about connections and users. Since an interface is required for each device connected, this database must contain all of the information about those devices and how they are connected. All of this data is then pulled together when a connection is requested."
"7. Explain DNS and its importance. DNS stands for Domain Name System. It is a system that maps hostnames to IP addresses so that you can find the correct server when you type in a website address in your browser. The DNS system associates each domain name with one or more IP addresses, which are called ""resolvers."" When you type in a URL (e.g., www.google.com) into your browser, the computer sends a request to the DNS resolver for the IP address associated with that domain name. The DNS resolver then returns an IP address to the browser, which is either the IP address of a local computer or of another server that has been configured to return that particular IP address. Consider the below image for a better understanding - SRE Interview Questions DNS is necessary because hosts on the Internet have only human-readable names like google.com and not machine-readable names like 111.222.333.444. Without DNS, you would need to know how to interpret a URL's human-readable name in order to find it on the Internet, which would be very diﬀicult without a centralized authority like Google to help you out!"
"8. Explain APR. Also, what are the stages of this? ARP stands for Address Resolution Protocol. ARP is a protocol that allows devices on local networks to communicate with each other. It enables devices on the same network to find each other’s IP address, MAC address, and other network information. In short, it is used to automatically assign IP addresses to network devices so they can talk to each other. This process occurs in 3 main stages: Discovering an IP address (ARP packets are sent out). Resolving an IP address (the device looks up the IP address using its own IP address table). Using a MAC address (the device looks up the MAC address using its own MAC address table). SRE Interview Questions ARP packets work by sending out a request to find any devices that have an IP address associated with them. The device receiving the packet will reply with its own list of IP addresses and other information. Each device maintains a table of known addresses so it knows how to resolve IP addresses when necessary."

"10. What is Multithreading? What are the benefits of this? Multithreading is a programming technique that allows the execution of multiple tasks at the same time. To achieve this, each task is assigned its own processing unit or processor. By splitting up the workload across these processors, it is possible to process several tasks simultaneously. This can be helpful for processing large amounts of data, or when running short-lived tasks that have a high resource consumption. Multithreading can be implemented in diﬀerent ways, depending on the underlying technology used. For example, multithreading can be achieved by executing multiple tasks on separate processors, or by running those tasks in parallel on a single processor. SRE Interview Questions Multithreading has many benefits. It allows for increased performance and reduced execution time of long-running computations. Also, it can improve the responsiveness of applications and reduce latency. Multithreading can also be used to execute short-lived tasks that have a high resource consumption. As such, multithreaded applications are ideal for use in IoT environments where there is a constant network traﬀic and battery drain due to sensor readings and other processes being executed within the device."
"11. What are the states that the process could be in? Processes are the computer program that is going to be executed by the CPU. And during the execution cycle of the process, it does from various stages. That is the process state. So the process states are - SRE Interview Questions New - A new process is a program that will be loaded into the main memory by the operating system. Ready - When a process is formed, it immediately enters the ready state and waits for the CPU to be assigned. The operating system selects new processes from secondary memory and places them all in the main memory. Ready-state processes are processes that are ready for execution and sit in the main memory. Many processes may be present in the ready stage. They all can be aligned into the queue for getting a chance to execute. Running - The OS will select one of the processes from the ready state based on the scheduling mechanism. As a result, if we only have one CPU in our system, the number of operating processes at any given time will always be one. If we have n processors in the system, we can run n tasks at the same time. Block/Wait - Depending on the scheduling method or the inherent behavior of the process, a process can migrate from the Running state to the block or wait for the state. When a process waits for a specific resource to be provided or for user input, the operating system moves it to the block or waits for the state and assigns the CPU to other processes. Terminated - The termination state is reached when a process completes its execution. The process's context (Process Control Block) will likewise be removed, and the process will be terminated by the operating system. Suspend Block/Wait - Rather than removing the process from the ready queue, it is preferable to delete the stalled process that is waiting for resources in the main memory. Because it is already waiting for a resource to become available, it is preferable if it waits in secondary memory to create a way for the higher priority process. These processes conclude their execution when the main memory becomes accessible and their wait is over. Suspend Ready - A process in the ready state that is transferred to secondary memory from main memory owing to a shortage of resources (mostly primary memory) is referred to as being in the suspend ready state. If the main memory is full and a higher-priority process arrives for execution, the OS must free up space in the main memory by moving the lower-priority process to secondary memory. Suspend-ready processes are kept in secondary memory until the main memory becomes accessible. SRE Interview Questions"
"12. What is RAID? “Redundant Array of Independent Disk” is a term used to describe a type of storage system that has more than one hard disk to provide more redundancy in case one disk fails. A redundant Array of Independent Disk is commonly used in networks and server farms. Redundant Array of Independent Disk systems is routinely used in data centres; they provide a second disk drive on a single physical system so if the first disk fails, the user can continue working by accessing the second disk drive. This extra protection means users don’t have to worry about losing data if a drive fails. Redundant Array of Independent Disk systems can be implemented as a single controller with multiple drives or as multiple controllers connected to each other with each controller housing a single drive. The resulting configuration can be optimized for throughput or for redundancy. This type of storage system is available from many vendors and can be found in medium-sized or even large-scale enterprise environments, where it's essential for ensuring the availability of critical data."
13. What are Vertical and Horizontal Scaling? Which is more preferable? And list some advantages and disadvantages of Horizontal Scaling. Vertical scaling is a process of increasing the size of a system by increasing its number of resources. This is o
"14. What is LILO? LILO (Linux Loader) is a bootloader for Linux that is used to load Linux into memory and start the operating system. It is also known as a boot manager since it allows a computer to dual boot. It can act as a master boot program or a secondary boot program, and it performs a variety of tasks such as locating the kernel, identifying other supporting programs, loading memory, and launching the kernel. If you wish to utilize Linux OS, you must install a special bootloader called LILO, which allows Linux OS to boot quickly."
"15. What do you know about Linux Shell? List Diﬀerent types of Shell. Linux Shell is an integral part of the Linux OS. The Linux OS is a free and open-source OS developed by Linus Torvalds. It is the most popular OS to run on servers and embedded devices. A Linux shell is a command line interface that allows the user to interact with the system. The command line interface (CLI) of Linux provides a text- based interface for executing commands, performing file management tasks, and issuing other system commands. There are two types of shells in Linux – SRE Interview Questions Interactive shell - It starts automatically when a user logs into their computer. Non-Interactive shell - It can be started manually for the execution of any program. These two types allow diﬀerent users to have access to diﬀerent sets of commands, depending on whether they are logged in or not. In most cases, non-interactive shells are used for administrative tasks such as managing user accounts and managing applications or services. On a typical Linux system, the following shells are widely used: KSH (Korn Shell) BASH (Bourne Again Shell) TCSH CSH (C Shell) Bourne Shell ZSH"
"16. What is a “/proc” file system? A “/proc” file system is a special type of file system that has special access permissions. It is mounted in Linux systems when the kernel needs to execute a process or access certain system resources. A /proc directory contains information about the current state of the system, such as memory usage and CPU speed. There are three subdirectories under /proc: /proc/1: This is the first subdirectory in the /proc directory tree. It contains information about the CPU and its speed. /proc/1/cmdline: This subdirectory contains the command line parameters passed to the currently running process. /proc/1/maps: This subdirectory contains virtual memory map data for processes running on Linux systems. It can be used to determine which parts of the memory are being used by which process."
"17. What is Linux Kill Command? SRE Interview Questions Linux kills command is an easy way to kill all running processes. With this command, you can kill a process, e.g., a program, a service, or a process that is not running on any Linux system. In other words, it will bring down or terminate any process running on the system. By using the Linux kill command, you can close down a malfunctioning application or stop a misbehaving service. You can also use the kill command to terminate misbehaving jobs in batch scripts. Through this command, you can also reboot the server or halt it while shutting down the network connection and power oﬀ the server with one single command."
"18. How can you use OOPs in designing a Server? OOPs is a programming paradigm that encourages the creation of objects to represent real-world entities and these objects are then used to perform tasks. These can be useful in designing a Server because they allow you to break down the tasks into manageable chunks, which will help you to keep your Server under control. As well as this, OOPs allows you to create reusable code which will save time and money. When designing a Server using OOPs, it’s important to follow some basic design principles. The first of these is the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP). This states that each object should have one and only one reason to exist. For example, if you’re creating an Order Repository, it should only be responsible for one thing -- processing orders. This will help ensure that your code is easy to read and maintain. The second principle is the Open/Closed Principle (OCP), which states that an object should be either open for addition or closed for modification. For example, if you’re creating an Order Repository, it should be able to accept new orders but not modify existing ones."
"19. Explain CDN. SRE Interview Questions A CDN (Content Delivery Network) is a network of servers that stores and distributes content to clients. These servers are typically located in data centres, and they can be used to improve performance by reducing latency, ensuring that the content is available at the right time, and ensuring that the content is delivered in a timely manner. CDNs are most commonly used to store static content, such as images and videos, but they can also be used to store dynamic content, such as HTML or JavaScript. CDNs can also be used to deliver content from one location to another, such as from a website to a mobile device. CDNs are an important part of the Internet infrastructure because they allow content to be stored and distributed in a more eﬀicient way. They also allow content to be served from multiple locations, which can improve performance and reduce latency. A CDN can be used in many diﬀerent ways, including Providing a central location for static content. Providing a central location for dynamic content. Providing a central location for content from multiple locations. Providing a central location for content from multiple data centers. Providing redundancy for critical infrastructure components such as servers and routers. CDNs are also an important part of the Internet infrastructure because they help to ensure that the Internet works well for everyone. They help to ensure that everyone has access to the same content at the same time, and equally prioritize access. SRE Interview Questions for Experienced"
"20. Explain the term SLO. A Service Level Objective (SLO) is a measure of how good or bad the service quality is, and it is usually expressed as a percentage. It shows how close the actual performance of the service level is to what was expected. An SLO is typically set by the customer, but can also be set by management as a way to monitor performance. SRE Interview Questions SLOs are important because they can help organizations understand when they are underperforming, and they can also help them set targets for improvement. By setting targets, managers have something to strive toward and can motivate employees to work harder. When you’re setting up an SLO, remember that it’s not just about what your customers are getting right now—it’s also about what they could be getting right in the future. So think about both short-term and long-term goals when making your SLO. The main objective of SLO is to ensure that customers receive quality service, as measured by the: Completeness of order fulfilment. Quality of product. Timeliness of delivery. Accuracy and completeness of the information provided to customers. Communication and support provided by employees."
"21. Define Service Level Indicators. Service Level Indicators are the key measurements that show if service is on track. Without them, it’s diﬀicult to know if the organization is meeting its objectives. There are three main types of SLIs: Availability, Response Time, and Quality of Service. Availability measures how o"
"22. Explain TCP. Also, diﬀerent TCP connection states. A TCP connection state is a relationship between a client TCP endpoint and a server TCP endpoint. These states are defined by the TCP three-way handshake process. The three-way handshake process allows TCP to establish a connection between two endpoints, where one side initiates a connection setup using an SYN packet, while the other side responds with an ACK packet. Once both sides have sent and received their respective SYN and ACK packets, an established connection is created. A"
"23. Define INodes. Also, state the reason why it is important. Inodes are the units of storage on a Linux filesystem. Every file, directory, and block device has an inode associated with it, which is essentially a pointer to where the file is located in the filesystem. Inodes also have other properties such as their size and owner and group ID. If a file or directory is deleted, the inode will be marked as deleted and all data associated with that inode will be removed as well. Inodes are an important resource for both performance and security. There are a number of reasons why they can be important: SRE Interview Questions For performance, inodes are used to determine how much space a file occupies, so they can be used to optimize the placement of files that are likely to change frequently. When a file is created or moved between partitions, it must go through the inode stage first. For security, there are two main roles for inodes: indexing and ACLs (access control lists). Indexing allows tools like locate or grep to quickly find files by name or location. ACLs allow users to control access to their files based on permissions assigned by their system administrator. In addition, having all files written to disk as soon as they are modified can help prevent data loss due to power outages or other unforeseen events. Finally, while most people might assume that inodes are used primarily for storing data on disk drives, Inodes are also used to track metadata about every file on your computer, as well as directories and other objects stored on your computer’s hard drive. This data is used to keep track of which files have been deleted, modified, or copied, and can also be used to determine the overall health and performance of your computer."
"24. What is Observability? And what are the diﬀerent types of Observability? ANd how can you improve the observability of the system? Observability is the term used to describe the ability of an organization to track real- time events and metrics within a system. Systems that are more Observable are able to capture data from devices within the organization, such as smartphones and tablets. This data can then be used to track activities within the organization, such as the number of employees who log into work each day. There are many diﬀerent types of observability within an organization, including: SRE Interview Questions Real-time monitoring: This type of observability allows users in the organization to monitor what is happening in real time. This includes things like the number of people who visit a website on their phone or tablet. Historical monitoring: This type of observability allows users in the organization to view data from previous periods. This type of observability may be most useful when tracking financial transactions, such as how much money has been spent over time. System-wide monitoring: This type of observability can be used across all devices in an organization, including phones and computers. System-wide monitoring allows users in the organization to view data across all devices within the organization. We can increase the observability of the organization by - Recognize the sorts of data that flow from an environment and which of those data types are relevant and valuable to your observability goals. Determine how your strategy is making sense of data by distilling, filtering, and translating it into actionable insights regarding the performance of your systems. Observability can provide helpful information about an organization's DevOps maturity level."

"26. What are SLA and SLI? A service-level agreement (SLA) is a commitment we make to a client about uptime. These are frequently legally specified, with consequences for failing to meet the desired availability. As a result, SLAs are typically established with values that are simpler to satisfy than SLOs. A service-level indicator (SLI) is anything that can be precisely measured to assist you in thinking about, defining, and determining if you are satisfying SLOs and SLAs. They are commonly presented as the ratio of the number of excellent occurrences to the total number of events. A simple example would be the number of successful HTTP requests divided by the total number of HTTP queries. SLIs are typically stated as a percentage, with 0 indicating that everything is broken and 100 indicating that everything is operating flawlessly."
"27. What does Virtualization means? Virtualization is the process of using one physical system to run multiple virtual machines. It is commonly used by companies that want to consolidate computing resources and keep them running 24/7 without having to buy more hardware. Virtualization can also be used for testing purposes, such as for so"
"28. What are containers in servers? SRE Interview Questions Containers in the server are like a virtual machine that runs an application. A container can be compared with a virtual machine because it provides an environment for running applications. However, containers are diﬀerent from virtual machines in many ways. First, containers are much more lightweight than virtual machines. They take up far less space on disk and use fewer CPU resources. Second, containers don’t need to be preinstalled on a server. Therefore, they can be deployed quickly and easily. Third, containers can run on any type of hardware, from desktop computers to high-end servers. Finally, containers can only be used for running specific applications and not for general-purpose computing tasks like email or word processing. Having said all these diﬀerences between containers and virtual machines, one thing is certain: Containers are the future of server infrastructure! When it comes to deploying modern enterprise applications in today's digital world, container technology has proven itself to be the most reliable solution. From deployment speed to stability to security controls, container technology oﬀers unparalleled advantages over traditional virtualization methods. While there are numerous vendors providing solutions that enable the creation of containers (e.g., Docker), there is no single standard or protocol that governs container technology. This lack of standardization presents challenges when trying to deploy containerized applications across multiple organizations or even within an organization's own data centers."

SRE Interview Questions A three-tier architecture is a type of architecture in which the application logic is separated from the data storage and retrieval. The three-tier architecture can be implemented in a wide range of business applications, including CRM, e- commerce, and enterprise resource planning (ERP). The three-tier architecture is o"
"30. Describe the Sharding process. How does sharding improve performance? Sharding is a method of dividing a database into multiple pieces. Each piece stores a subset of the data, which can be used to run diﬀerent types of queries. Sharding makes it possible to distribute the workload across many more servers. This can reduce the time it takes to process queries and improve performance. Sharding is also useful when you need to store a large number of small objects (e.g., objects with low cardinality). In this case, each object is stored in its own piece, and only one piece can be read at a time. Sharding can be used to improve performance in two main ways: By running several smaller jobs on a single machine, it becomes possible to spread out the load between many machines. By storing objects in separate pieces, it becomes possible to read only the piece that needs to be accessed at any given time. SRE Interview Questions"

"32. What is Consistent Hashing? Consistent hashing is a technique that helps you to maintain database integrity by ensuring that every read operation will always return the same result. SRE Interview Questions In database systems, consistent hashing is a way of keeping data in sync by ensuring that each piece of data has been hashed in the same way. In other words, if you have two database tables, A and B, and you want to ensure that both tables have the same data, then you need to hash all of the entries in both tables together (A and B). This ensures that every time you read from table A, it will be returned with the same hash value. If another user then goes to read from table B, they will get the same hash value back. As long as there are no changes to either table, this means both tables should have the same data."
"33. Explain in detail the working of ARP. Most computer applications employ IP addresses (logical addresses) to send or receive messages, therefore actual communication takes occurs via physical addresses (MAC addresses). So the goal of ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) is to determine the destination's MAC address, which will allow us to interact with other devices. In this scenario, the ARP is truly necessary since it translates the IP address to a physical address. SRE Interview Questions When the source wishes to interact with the destination at the network layer. First, the source must determine the destination's MAC address (Physical Address). The source will look in the ARP cache and ARP database for the destination's MAC address. If the destination's MAC address is found in the ARP cache or ARP table, the source uses that MAC address for communication. If the destination's MAC address is not in the ARP cache or table, the Source sends an ARP Request message. The source's MAC address and IP address are included in the ARP Request message. It also includes the destination's IP address and MAC address. The destination's MAC address was le"
"34. How will you secure your Docker containers? Follow these instructions to secure your Docker container: SRE Interview Questions Choose third-party containers with caution. Turn on Docker content trust. Limit the resources available to your containers. Consider utilizing a third-party security product. Docker Bench Security should be used. Other than these questions, there are also some questions that are based on your personal understanding of the system if you are an experienced person. The questions can be like this - How can you strengthen the bond between the operations and IT teams? What is the distinction between site reliability engineers and development operations? What actions would you take to develop a monitoring strategy for a service that does not have one? How can information technology infrastructure be scaled? What type of experience do you have building deployment automation code? Why would you want to be an SRE rather than an SDE?

"36. Write a program to check If all asteroids can be eliminated, then return true. Return false otherwise. SRE Interview Questions You are given an integer mass that represents a planet's initial mass. You are also provided with an integer array called asteroids, where asteroids[i] represent the mass of the ith asteroid. You may make the planet smash with the asteroids in whatever sequence you like. If the planet's mass is more than or equal to the asteroid's mass, the asteroid is destroyed and the planet obtains the asteroid's mass. Otherwise, the world will be destroyed. One of the many solutions can be sorting the asteroid array. By sorting this, we can pick the smallest element such that it can gain the mass of the planet. And if the planet destroys (if planet's mass is less than asteroids) then we will return false. So the solution can be - public boolean asteroidsDestroyed(int mass, int[] asteroids) { //Sorting the array Arrays.sort(asteroids); int n = asteroids.length; for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){ //Attacking the planet with asteroid if(mass >= asteroids[i]) mass += asteroids[i]; //If the mass of the planet becomes greater than the largest //asteroid then no need to check further, just return true. if(mass > asteroids[n-1]) return true; } //If the planet is being destroyed by the asteroid return false; } We have used sorting and sorting takes O(n*log n) times. So the time complexity of the solution will also be O(n*log n). SRE Interview Questions"
"37. Create a simple version of Twitter in which users may submit tweets, follow/unfollow other users, and view the 10 most recent tweets in their news feed. Use the Twitter class as follows:"
1. Twitter() creates a new Twitter object.
"2. void postTweet(int userId, int tweetId) Creates a new tweet with the user userId's ID tweetId. Each call to this method will be accompanied by a distinct tweetId."
3. List getNewsFeed(int userId) returns the user's news feed's ten most recent tweet IDs. Each item in the news feed must have been uploaded by either the user's followers or the user themselves. Tweets must be sorted in chronological order from most recent to least recent.
"4. void follow(int followerId, int followeeId) The user with the ID followerId began to follow the user with the ID followeeId."
"5. void unfollow(int followerId, int followeeId) The user with the ID followerId unfollowed the user with the ID followeeId. SRE Interview Questions The classes and methods are already defined and we need to implement the logic. So we can use the Hashmap that points to every user. And each user can be represented as a node. So the user can be obtained in constant time. And similarly, we can use the node for each tweet that consists of the records of the tweets and the userId to whom the tweets belong. So the Solution can be - SRE Interview Questions class Twitter { //This belongs to each individual user and his/her following. private class User{ int userID; HashMap<Integer, Boolean> followings; User(int id){ userID = id; followings = new HashMap<>(); } } //Every Individual tweet. And belongs to which user. private class Tweet{ int tweetID, userID; Tweet(int userID, int tweetID){ this.tweetID = tweetID; this.userID = userID; } } //List that consists of every tweets. List<Tweet> tweets; //Map to get the user details in constant time. HashMap<Integer, User> map; public Twitter() { map = new HashMap<>(); tweets = new ArrayList<>(); } public void postTweet(int userId, int tweetId) { //If user don't exist, so create user if(!map.containsKey(userId)) map.put(userId, new User(userId)); //adding the tweets in the list for particular user tweets.add(new Tweet(userId, tweetId)); } public List<Integer> getNewsFeed(int userId) { List<Integer> feeds = new ArrayList<>(); int n = tweets.size()-1; int count = 0; //Loop that gives 10 recent tweets if it have otherwise //whatever less than 10 tweets of followed user. while(n >= 0 && count < 10){ int tweetID = tweets.get(n).tweetID; int userID = tweets.get(n).userID; //Checking if user followed the user for which the //tweet belongs. boolean exist = (map.get(userId)).followings.containsKey(userID); if(userId == userID || exist){ feeds.add(tweetID); SRE Interview Questions The time complexity for the solution will be O(10) which is nothing but constant. It is because at most 10 tweets must be returned to the user."
"38. Given a root of the binary tree, a node X in the tree is called good if there are no nodes with values larger than X along the route from root to X. Write a program in which the number of good nodes in the binary tree should be returned. Example - Consider the tree given below. The Nodes marked with yellow color are good nodes. Because no such nodes in between have a value greater than the current node up to the root. [7,8,9,7] SRE Interview Questions For solving this problem, we need to traverse every node by passing the current node value recursively. If on every node, the value passed from the parent node will be compared. If the node is found greater than the value from the parent node. Then the count will be incremented and we can update the value with the current node value and pass it to both the child recursively. So the code for this approach will be - class Solution { //Global variable that keeps count of the good nodes. int ans; private void solution(TreeNode root, int val){ //When found the node value greater than the value from parent if(root.val >= val){ ans++; val = root.val; } //Recursively calling the solution if the child node exists. if(root.left != null) solution(root.left, val); if(root.right != null) solution(root.right, val); } public int goodNodes(TreeNode root) { //Calling helper method to count the good node. solution(root, root.val); return ans; } } The time complexity for the above approach will be O(n) because we have to traverse all the nodes at once. And we have used recursion so we can say that because of the call stack, the space complexity will be O(n)."

"Full Stack Developer Interview Questions Before we begin, let's first determine who exactly is a full-stack developer. Who is a Full-Stack Developer? A full-stack web developer is a person who can develop both client and server so"
"1. To develop a project from scratch, what technologies and languages would you need or what skills a full stack developer should have? A full-stack developer must be familiar with the following: Full Stack Developer Interview Questions Programming Languages: Full-stack developers should be competent in more than one programming language, such as Java, Python, PHP, Ruby, C++, etc. Front End technologies: You should be familiar with front-end technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, etc. Knowledge of third-party libraries such as jQuery, Ajax, Angular, ReactJS, etc., is also important. Frameworks: This requires proficiency in a variety of development frameworks, including Spring, Spring Boot, Django, MyBatis, PHP, Hibernate, and others. Databases and caches: As a full stack developer, you should also know about various DBMS (Database Management Systems) technologies like MySQL, SQLite, Oracle, and MongoDB. It is helpful to have a basic understanding of caching mechanisms like redis, memcached, varnish. Design Ability: Having a good understanding of design is also important if you wish to become a successful Full-Stack web developer. Moreover, the person should be aware of the principles of prototyping and UX/UI design. Server: Experience with Apache or NGINX would be beneficial. Good knowledge of Linux helps enormously when administering servers."
"2. Which language is the most preferred by full-stack developers? Full Stack Developers utilize several programming languages. Ideally, a candidate should be fluent in several languages, preferably some for designing the front end and others for fixing the back end. Since Full Stack developers work with a variety of technologies and applications, they must be proficient in at least two to three of the most popular languages such as Java, Python, Ruby, PHP, C++, etc."
"3. Explain Pair Programming. In pair programming, two programmers share only one machine and work together. During the development process, one programmer will be the driver who codes and another will act as the observer (navigator) who will make sure the code is written correctly, proofread and spell-check it, while also deciding where to go next. Roles can be swapped at any time: the driver becomes the observer and vice versa. You can also call it ""pairing"", ""paired programming"", or ""programming in pairs"". Full Stack Developer Interview Questions Advantages: Two of them will fix the problem if the driver encounters any issues with the code. The two programmers working on the same program are only 15% slower than if they worked independently instead of 50%. As a result of having another programmer look over your work, you are more likely to write better code. One study showed that it results in 15% fewer bugs than code written by a single programmer. It leads to improved collaboration, higher quality, better code, and sustained improved development practices. During the project, each person teaches the other, resulting in more eﬀicient and expedited knowledge exchange. The team develops better communication skills."
"4. What do you mean by CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)? Full Stack Developer Interview Questions CORS refers to cross-origin resource sharing. It's a browser mechanism that allows web pages in one domain to have controlled access to resources in other domains (cross-domain requests). This allows scripts that are run on a browser client to interact with and access resources from other origins. In doing so, it extends and provides greater flexibility to the SOP (Same-Origin Policy). Same-origin policies restrict the ability of a website to access resources outside of its source domain. For example, a JavaScript app that wants to make a call to an API (Application Programming Interface) that runs on another domain will be blocked due to the SOP. A CORS policy was implemented to circumvent restrictions caused by same-origin policies. In addition, if a website's CORS policy is not configured properly, it may be vulnerable to cross-domain attacks. This means that it cannot stop cross-origin attacks like CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)."
"5. What is Callback Hell? Full Stack Developer Interview Questions Callback Hell, or Pyramid of Doom, is a common anti-pattern seen in asynchronous programming code (multiple functions running at the same time). This slang term describes a large number of nested ""if"" statements or functions. In simple terms, Callback hell is a situation where you have multiple asynchronous functions. Those functions depend on one another, so it could get quite messy with so many callback functions nested in so many layers. The use of callback functions leaves you with code that is diﬀicult to read and maintain, and looks like a pyramid as shown below: This also makes it more diﬀicult to identify the flow of the application, which is the main obstacle to debugging, which is the reason for the famous name of this problem: Callback Hell."
"6. Explain Long Polling. Long polling is defined as a web application development technique used to push information/data from servers to clients as quickly as possible. When a request is made from the client to the server, long-polling maintains the connection between the two. This connection is maintained until the information is ready to be sent from the server to the client. Once a server receives a request from a client, the connection does not close immediately; the connection is only closed once the server has sent the data back to the client or when a timeout threshold has been reached (connection timeout).

"7. Can you tell me what are the latest trends in Full Stack Development? Also, how do you keep yourself updated about the new trends in the industry? Each business needs emerging technology to thrive, whether it is mobile or web application development. This is why they hire front-end developers, back-end developers, or full-stack developers depending on their technology needs. According to industry experts, candidates who are passionate about full-stack development should be aware of these trends: The rise in frameworks and libraries like ReacJs and VueJs, progressive apps, real-time web apps, and mobile web development. Enhancements to JavaScript are beneficial to programming The emergence of a more compatible extension. The interviewer may ask you how you keep updated with new trends in the industry. You can explain how you gain your knowledge and understanding by learning from friends, colleagues, or online. That's an appropriate way of answering the question.

"8. State diﬀerence between GraphQL and REST (Representational State Transfer). For decades, REST (Representational State Transfer) has been a popular architectural way to design APIs (Application Programming Interfaces), but the popularity of GraphQL over the past few years threatens to topple REST. In general, REST and GraphQL both aim to transfer data over internet protocols including HTTP. How they do so diﬀers greatly, however. Full Stack Developer Interview Questions GraphQL REST It is a Query Language for APIs that enables declarative data fetching to provide clients control over which data to retrieve from the API. It is an API design architectural style that defines a set of constraints to create web services. GraphQL is known for its high predictability. With this, you can send requests to your API and get the exact results you are looking for without having to include anything you don't need. GraphQL queries give predictable results, which improves their usability significantly.On the other hand, REST's behaviour depends on the HTTP and URI methods used. API consumers can therefore be unsure of what to expect when calling an endpoint. API security can be ensured by GraphQL, though the security features aren't as mature as those of REST.

"10. Explain the meaning of multithreading. The thread is an independent part or unit of a process (or an application) that is being executed. Whenever multiple threads execute in a process at the same time, we call this ""multithreading"". You can think of it as a way for an application to multitask. Advantages: Full Stack Developer Interview Questions By multithreading, computing resources are also minimized and used more eﬀectively. The response time of the application is improved since requests from one thread do not block requests from other threads. Consequently, if one of the threads encounters an exception, it will not aﬀect the other threads. Multithreading, on the other hand, uses fewer resources than running multiple processes simultaneously. The overhead, time usage, and management associated with creating processes are much higher when compared to creating and managing threads."
"11. Explain the benefits and drawbacks of using ""use strict"". In ECMAScript5, a new feature known as strict mode allows you to run a program or function within a strict operating context. Certain actions, therefore, cannot be taken due to this strict context, and more exceptions are thrown. When the ""use strict"" statement is used, the browser is instructed to use ""strict"" mode, which is a more restricted and safer JavaScript feature set. You can specify ""use strict"" at the top of a function to evaluate the JS in strict mode. In strict mode, more errors are thrown and some features are disabled to make your code more robust, clear, and accurate. Full Stack Developer Interview Questions Advantages: Errors are thrown when some common coding mistakes are detected. By having strict mode, mistakes that make JavaScript engines tough to optimize can be fixed. Sometimes, strict mode code runs faster than similar, non-strict mode code. Generally, it prevents or throws an error when an ""unsafe"" action is taken (for example, accessing the global object). It disables poorly thought-out or confusing features. Strict mode simplifies the process of writing ""secure"" JavaScript. Disadvantages: Many of the functions that most developers use are absent. It is not possible to access function.caller or function.arguments anymore. If you concatenate scripts written in diﬀerent strict modes, you may encounter problems."
12. What are some of the uses of Docker? One of the thorniest problems in so
"13. Explain event loop in Node.js. The event loop in JavaScript enables asynchronous programming. With JS, every operation takes place on a single thread, but through smart data structures, we can create the illusion of multi-threading. With the Event Loop, any async work is handled by a queue and listener. Consider the diagram below: Therefore, when an async function (or an I/O) needs to be executed, the main thread relays it to another thread, allowing v8 (Javascript engine) to continue processing or running its code. In the event loop, there are diﬀerent phases, like pending callbacks, closing callbacks, timers, idle or preparing, polling, and checking, with diﬀerent FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queues.

"14. Is there a way to decrease the load time of a web application? Here are some ways to reduce load times for web applications: Image Optimization: The file size of an image can be dramatically reduced by switching to a diﬀerent file format. For example, GIFs work well for images with few colors, such as logos, JPEG is ideal for images with lots of colors and details, such as photographs, and PNG format is ideal for transparent images with high quality. Keep JavaScript and CSS in external files: Embedding JavaScript and CSS in HTML documents forces them to be downloaded every time the HTML document is loaded. In this case, browser caching is not utilized, and the HTML document becomes larger. This is why you should always place CSS and JavaScript in external files; it is a best practice and simplifies maintenance. Reducing redirects: Too many redirects will delay the loading time of a website. HTTP requests and responses are delayed each time a page redirects. Getting rid of unnecessary redirects on your site will reduce the load time of your site significantly. Load CSS and JavaScript files asynchronously: Your website contains CSS and JavaScript files that can be loaded either synchronously or asynchronously. As part of synchronous loading, each file is loaded sequentially, in the order it appears on your site. As opposed to synchronous loading, asynchronous loading allows multiple files to be loaded simultaneously, boosting the performance of a website. Minify HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: If you optimize the way your files load, your pages will load more quickly. You can do the same when it comes to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code. By eliminating unnecessary spaces, characters, and comments, you can reduce the size of your files. This will make your web pages load faster."
15. Explain dependency injection. Full Stack Developer Interview Questions The Dependency Injection (DI) pattern is a design pattern for implementing the Inversion of Control (IoC). Dependent objects can be created outside of classes and made available to classes in diﬀerent ways. Three types of classes are involved in Dependency Injection as follows: Client Class: A client class (dependent class) is one that depends on the service class. Service Class: Service (dependency) classes provide services to client classes. Injector Class: This class injects the objects from the service class into the client class.
"16. What do you mean by observer pattern? If several objects are tied together in one-to-many relationships, the observer pattern is used. Every time one object is modified, then all of its dependent objects are automatically notified and updated. It falls under the behavioural pattern category. It describes the coupling between the objects and the observer and provides support for broadcast-type communication. The object that observes the state of another object is known as the observer, and the object that is being observed is known as the subject as shown below: Full Stack Developer Interview Questions Full Stack Developer Interview Questions for Experienced"

"19. What do you mean by referential transparency in functional programming? In functional programming, referential transparency is the key diﬀerentiating factor. An expression is considered referential transparent if it can be replaced or substituted with the corresponding value it computes or vice-versa without aﬀecting the program’s result. Example: Imagine that we have an expression called four: val four= add(1,3) Full Stack Developer Interview Questions If four is used anywhere in our code, it can safely be replaced with add(1,3), 1 + 3 or 4 wherever it appears. Thus, all the expressions below are equivalent in meaning and output: val eight = four + four val eight_v2 = add(1,3) + add(1,3) val eight_v3 = 4 + add(1,3) val eight_v4 = 8 If we can swap back-and-forth between these expressions anytime, anywhere, without altering their meaning or output, then an expression is referentially transparent."
"20. State diﬀerence between normalization and denormalization. Normalization and denormalization are the two main methods of altering the structure of a database. Full Stack Developer Interview Questions Normalization Denormalization Normalization involves removing redundant data (multiple copies of data) from a database and storing consistent, non- redundant data.It involves combining data from multiple tables into a single so that it can be queried quickly. It primarily focuses on clearing out unused data and reducing duplicate data and inconsistencies from a database.On the other hand, denormalization aims to achieve faster query execution by adding data redundancy. During normalization, tables are reduced in number due to the reduction of data in the database.Denormalization, on the other hand, involves integrating data into the same database and therefore the number of tables to store the data increases. Data integrity is maintained by normalization. A change to the data in the table will not impact its relationship with the other table.Data integrity is not maintained by denormalization. It optimizes the use of disk space.It does not optimize disk space. Full Stack Developer Interview Questions"
"21. In Java, what is a connection leak? How can you fix this? If a connection is opened and forgotten about, this is known as a ""leak"" since each time it occurs, a connection is no longer available for reuse. Connection leaks occur when some database requests or transactions are not closed properly or are not committed, causing the connections to be abandoned and closed permanently. Java developers commonly experience Connection Leaks when using Connection Pools. In the case where there is a section of code that fails to close a connection properly, a connection will leak from the pool each time the section of code is executed. Eventually, if this situation continues, the pool will run out of connections, which is known as Pool Exhaustion. The application will hang once all available connections have been leaked. We can fix this by closing the connection and paying particular attention to any error handling code."
"22. What is Promise and explain its states? Callback functions are functions that can be passed to another function as arguments and executed there to complete a routine or action. Those functions depend on one another, so it could get quite messy with so many callback functions nested in so many layers. This is what is referred to as callback hell. As an alternative to callbacks in JavaScript, promises are used to handle asynchronous operations. In addition to handling multiple asynchronous operations, they provide better error handling than callbacks. Promises can be a better way for a user to read the code eﬀectively and eﬀiciently, especially when that particular code performs multiple asynchronous operations. The Promise object represents the result of an asynchronous operation (or its failure) and the resulting value. The promise is in one of the following states: Pending: In its initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected. Fulfilled: Indicating that the operation was successful. Rejected: Indicating that the operation failed."
"23. State the diﬀerence between GET and POST. GET and POST are two diﬀerent HTTP request methods. Full Stack Developer Interview Questions GET POST This method is used to request data from a certain resource (via some API URL).This method is used to send or write data to be processed to a specific resource (via some API URL). If you use the GET method to send data, the data is added to the URL, and a URL can be up to 2048 characters in length. Therefore, it has restrictions on data length.It does not impose such limitations. In comparison to POST, GET is less secure since data is sent as part of the URL. Passwords and other sensitive information should never be sent using GET.It is a little safer to use POST than GET because the parameters are not saved in the browser history or the web server logs. Everyone can see the data in the URL.There is no data displayed in the URL."
24. Explain the Restful API and write its usage. Full Stack Developer Interview Questions APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are sets of rules and protocols that define how so
"25. What do you mean by MEAN Stack? MEAN stands for MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS, and Node.js. It is a collection of JavaScript-based technologies for developing web applications. Despite being a stack of diﬀerent technologies, all of them are based on the JavaScript language. It is an ideal solution for building dynamic websites and applications as it is a very user- friendly stack. With this free and open-source stack, you can quickly and easily build web-based prototypes."
"26. Do you know how to prevent a bot from scraping your publicly accessible API? As long as the data within the API is accessible to the public, it will technically not be possible to completely prevent data scraping. It is possible, however, to minimize bot activity (automated computer programs on the internet that perform certain tasks) by throttling or rare limiting. Rare limiting will be able to prevent a certain device from making an unlimited number of requests within a defined time. If too many requests are made beyond the defined limit, a 429 Too Many Attempts HTTP error is thrown. It is vital to record more than just the IP address of the device since the IP address is not unique to each device and can stop the whole network from accessing the API."

"28. What do you mean by Temporal Dead Zone in ES6? Full Stack Developer Interview Questions Before ES6, variable declarations were only possible using var. With ES6, we got let and const. Both let and const declarations are block-scoped, i.e., they can only be accessed within the "" { } "" surrounding them. On the other hand, var doesn't have such a restriction. Unlike var, which can be accessed before its declaration, you cannot access the let or const variables until they are initialized with some value. Temporal Dead Zone is the time from the beginning of the execution of a block in which let or const variables are declared until these variables are initialized. If anyone tries to access those variables during that zone, Javascript will always throw a reference error as given below. console.log(varNumber); // undefined console.log(letNumber); // Throws the reference error letNumber is not defined var varNumber = 3; let letNumber = 4; Both let and const variables are in the TDZ from the moment their enclosing scope starts to the moment they are declared."
"29. Why should arrow functions not be used in ES6? One of the most popular features of ES6 is the ""arrow functions"" (also known as ""fat arrow functions""). Arrow functions are a new way to write concise functions. Arrow functions oﬀer a compact alternative to traditional function expressions, but they have limitations and cannot be used in every case. The following is an ES5 function: function timesTwo(params) { return params * 2 } timesTwo(5); // 10 The same function can also be expressed as an arrow function in ES6 as follows: var timesTwo = params => params * 2 timesTwo(5); // 10 Full Stack Developer Interview Questions Diﬀerences & Limitations: Has no bindings to 'this' or 'super', so it shouldn't be used as a method. Has no new.target keyword. The call, apply, and bind methods are not suitable since they rely on establishing scope. Not suitable for use as constructors. Not possible for an arrow function to use the yield keyword within its body, etc."
"30. What is event bubbling and capturing in JavaScript? The propagation of events inside the DOM (Document Object Model) is known as 'Event Flow' in JavaScript. The event flow defines the order or sequence in which a particular web page receives an event. Accordingly, event flow (propagation) in JS is dependent on the following aspects: Event Bubbling: With Event Bubbling, the event is captured and handled first by the innermost element, and then propagates to the outermost element. Events propagate up the DOM tree from child elements until the topmost element is handled. Event Capturing: With Event Capturing, the event is captured and handled first by the outermost element, and then propagates to the innermost element. Event cycles propagate starting with the wrapper elements and ending with the target elements that initiated the event cycle. The following diagram will help you to understand the event propagation life cycle. Full Stack Developer Interview Questions"

"2. What do you understand by data-driven testing? Data-driven testing is an automation testing framework that involves testing data stored in a spreadsheet or a table and using that stored data as input values to the test scripts. This is done to avoid writing individual test cases of the same functionalities with diﬀerent inputs. The inputs to the test scripts can be stored in XML, CSV, XLS and other data formats. Database Testing Interview Questions There are 4 main types of data-driven testing based on the source of test data inputs: Key-driven: Here, dynamic data is provided as inputs to the test cases by employing a keyboard to retest the application and validate the business logic. Flat files: Application retesting is done by taking input data stored in flat files like .doc or .txt. Front-end object: The test scripts use data from front-end objects like list, table, menu, data window etc. Spreadsheet/Excel: Here, the test data is taken from data stored in excel sheets or spreadsheets."
3. What do you understand about Trigger Testing? Trigger testing involves testing the database triggers that answers the following questions:
1. Are the coding conventions followed while defining and coding the triggers?
2. Are the triggers executing the DML transactions successfully by satisfying all conditions?
3. Are the triggers updating the data correctly post the execution of queries?
"4. Is the application functionality working fine post the data updation, insertion or deletion?"
"4. What is Database Stress Testing? Database Stress Testing is one of the methods used for gauging the database performance by subjecting it to the heavy load that would potentially cause the system to fail at some point. This is used for identifying the breakdown points of the database application. Before performing this testing, proper planning needs to be done for avoiding the wastage of resources. This testing is also known as fatigue testing. It uses tools like LoadRunner and JMeter for accomplishing this."
"5. What do you understand by database transactions? Database Testing Interview Questions A database transaction is defined as a task sequence that is to be performed on the database to achieve the required results logically. The task can include creating, deleting, updating the records in the database tables. The tasks upon successful completion aﬀect the records in the database. A transaction provides 4 controls as listed below: COMMIT: This is used for saving all changes done utilizing the transaction. We generally use this post INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE statements. ROLLBACK: This is used for rolling back the transaction to the previous state before it was operated. We generally use this post INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE statements. SAVEPOINT: This is used for setting the point where the transaction is supposed to roll back. SET TRANSACTION: This is used for setting the name of the transaction."
6. What do you understand by Keys and indexes Testing? The keys and indexes testing in a database is a form of database testing which answers the below questions: Have the required primary keys and foreign keys constraints been created on the targetted tables? Are the foreign key references valid? Is the data type of the primary key of one table and the corresponding foreign key in the other table the same? Are the naming conventions being followed for all indexes and keys? Are the lengths and sizes of the required indexes and fields expected? Are the indexes clustered or non-clustered working as expected and is according to the business requirements?
"7. What do you understand by Non-functional testing in terms of database testing? Database Testing Interview Questions Non-functional testing in terms of testing databases involves various testing methods like stress testing, load testing, usability testing, security testing, etc that tests and validate the non-functional business requirements. It helps in the quantification of risks with regards to the database system in terms of how the system performs under heavy load. It addresses the following questions which help to mitigate the risks if detected earlier: Does the system break? Does the system slow down? Are there any risks to the system as the load or stress on the system increases? Is the system scalable and usable whenever new business requirements come in? Non-functional testing also helps in identifying what are the minimum system requirements to run eﬀectively without any limitations on hardware or so"
"8. What would be the SQL statements used for managing and manipulating the test tables? Database Testing Interview Questions We can use the statements like INSERT, UPDATE, SELECT, DELETE for manipulating the table content. Statements like ALTER TABLE, DELETE TABLE, CREATE TABLE are used for creating and managing the tables."
"9. What do you understand by validation of ACID properties in database testing? ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation and Durability. Everything refers to a property of database transactions. Atomicity – This refers to that the transactions are atomic which means that the result of the transaction can either be a success or a failure and nothing in between. Consistency – This property implies that the state of the database has to remain valid a"
10. What do you understand by retesting and how is it diﬀerent from data-driven testing? Retesting refers to the method of executing the same test script using diﬀerent input data every time. It helps in finding faults in the system when subjected to diﬀerent inputs. The faults can be fixed and once again the system can be subjected to testing using the same scripts with the same or diﬀerent inputs to check if it works fine. Retesting is diﬀerent from data-driven testing. This is because retesting is mostly a manual process that involves using a whole new data input set. Data-driven testing is an automated testing framework that has the test data and the scripts take the data and run it automatically.
11. Explain with an example how you can test the database manually? Database testing can be done manually as well. This requires human eﬀort in observing the behaviour of the application when subjected to diﬀerent manual test cases dra
12. How do you validate whether the database table has been updated a
"13. How is stored procedure testing done? Stored Procedures are similar to user-defined functions that are invoked using Cal Procedure or Execute Procedure statements. The output of these procedures is generally in the form of result sets. The stored procedures are stored in RDBMS and are readily available for the applications. These can be tested using the following techniques: White box testing: Here, the stubs are used for invoking stored procedures and the results of those are validated against our expected results. Black box testing: We perform operations on the front-end view of our application in a way that the stored procedures are invoked and we validate the result by observing the changes in the view."
"14. How will you know if a trigger is fired or not at the time of database testing? To know if a trigger is fired, we will have to enable the audit logs of the table. You can refer to the steps to access logs here."
"15. What are the diﬀerent SQL statements that can be used for database testing? Following are the SQL statements categories that can be used in database testing: Database Testing Interview Questions DDL – Data Definition Language: CREATE: Used for creating databases and their objects like tables, views etc. ALTER: Used for altering the properties of database objects. DROP: Used for dropping the database and objects of the database. TRUNCATE: Used for removing all records from a table without touching its structure. RENAME: Used for renaming the database objects. DML – Data Manipulation Language: SELECT: Used for selecting specific records or data from the database objects. INSERT: Used for inserting new data or records into the database tables. UPDATE: Used for updating existing records. DELETE: Used for deleting existing records. DQL – Data Query Language: SELECT queries come under data query language to query the data based on any given conditions. DCL – Data Control Language: Used for creating roles, granting permissions and controlling accesses to the database and the objects of the database. The commands that fall under DCL are: GRANT: Used for providing the user access permissions. DENY: Used for denying the user permissions. REVOKE: Used for removing the user access. TCL – Transaction Control Language: COMMIT: Used for writing and storing changes to the database. ROLLBACK: Used for restoring the changes to the database to the last commit.

16. Why do you think database testing is important in the field of so
17. Write the step-by-step process to test the database? The process to perform database testing is very similar to the steps that we follow for testing any other applications. Following are the steps that are followed:
1. Prepare the test environment and test scripts
2. Run the script
3. Check for the test results
4. Validate the results against the expected results.
5. Report the validation findings to the developers and the stakeholders. Database Testing Interview Questions
"18. What is structural database testing? This testing involves testing database structures that depend on schema, tables, triggers, functions, procedures and also the servers used for databases. Following are the types of structural testing: Database Testing Interview Questions Schema Testing: Here, the exact schema name should map between both front- end and backend. The schema validation is very important because in some cases, the schema of the tables would be diﬀerent from the actual business requirement and the front-end applications. This also involves verifying unmapped tables or views or columns. Tables Testing: This testing involves testing table names and testing columns. The names mapped to frontend and backend should be the same and the datatype and sizes of the columns should be as per the requirements specified by the business. It also involves testing constraints applied to the tables and columns. Furthermore, testing of indexes based on the property of clustered or non-clustered and their functionality should also be tested accordingly. Procedure and Function Testing: Here, the testers have to test the procedures and functions available in the database and validate for the list of points below: Did the team follow the business requirements correctly? Is the code following good practices and proper naming conventions? Are the parameters for input and output of these as per the expected requirements? Are the exceptions handled? Are the procedures and functions inserting data to required tables properly? Are the procedures and functions updating/modifying data in the required tables properly? Trigger testing: The testing rules are similar to the procedure or functional testing. In addition to those rules, we have to check if the triggers are getting triggered/executed at required instants. Database Server Testing: Test whether the database configurations, RAM, capacity of processors, storage capacity etc based on the business requirements."
"19. How do you test the database triggers and procedures? Database Testing Interview Questions For testing the database triggers and procedures, it is required to know the input parameters to these functionalities and know what would be the expected output for these. The EXEC statement can be used for determining the behaviour of the tables when the procedures or triggers are run. You can also achieve this by creating SQL unit tests for checking the database objects modified due to the execution of the triggers or procedures. The SQL unit tests follow the 3 rules as shown below: The test case should check whether the objects exist in the database or not. It should check or validate what the normal outputs would be for success scenarios. It should also check for the behaviour of the system under the influence of negative test cases."
"20. What are the possible test scenarios that need to be tested when a database gets migrated from one SQL server to another? Firstly, when migration happens, we need to be aware of all the changes and enhancements are done in the new SQL server. Based on this information, design your test case suite by considering the following points: Database Testing Interview Questions What is the data type used? What is the length of the fields used in the server? Are the database objects created as expected in the new SQL server? Perform stress testing on the new SQL server to identify any risks associated with the migrated environment."
"21. Why are SQL constraints used in a database? SQL Constraints are used for setting the rules for the records in the database table. If any constraints are not satisfied, then the action can be aborted. The constraints are defined when we create the database objects. It can also be altered by using the ALTER commands. SQL has 6 major constraints, they are:"
1. NOT NULL: This constraint is used for specifying that a column cannot have NULL values.
"2. UNIQUE: This constraint specifies that each column has a unique value, meaning the values are not repeated."
3. PRIMARY KEY: This constraint also combines NOT NULL and UNIQUE constraints and indicates that one or more combinations having this key is used for uniquely identifying a record in the database table.
4. FOREIGN KEY: It is used for ensuring the referential integrity of that record in the database table. It matches the value of a column in one table with the value defined as the primary key in the other table.
5. CHECK: It is used for ensuring whether the column values fulfil given specified conditions.
"6. DEFAULT: This constraint is used for adding default values to the column whenever needed. If the user specifies any value in the DEFAULT constraint, then at the time of record creation, if we do not specify values to that column, the default value will be saved in the table. Database Testing Interview Questions"
"22. How will you perform data load testing? Data load testing requires the testers to know about source databases and the destination databases and their objects like tables, columns, design, constraints etc. While performing tests, we need to validate the compatibility of the source and destination databases using the DTS package in SQL Enterprise Manager. We can follow the below steps for the same: Open the DTS package and run it. Compare the column data of the source and destination tables. Check for the number of rows in source and destination tables. Post updating data in source tables, check if the same changes are reflected in the destination database. Check about the data quality whether the destination data received any junk characters and NULL values. Check for the maximum processable volume on the servers and evaluate the response times and speed of data load from the source to destination."
"23. How can you test Transactions in SQL Databases? Database Testing Interview Questions Transactions require the ACID properties to be satisfied. To achieve that, we use the below statements: BEGIN TRANSACTION TRANSACTION# END TRANSACTION TRANSACTION# ROLLBACK TRANSACTION# The Rollback command ensures that the database changes are rolled back to the previous stable commit and ensures consistency. Once the transactions are executed, we can make use of SELECT queries to run on the tables where the transaction took place and validate the data."
"24. How can you validate the ACID properties? Explain with an example. Consider a simple SQL code below: CREATE TABLE ACID_DEMO (X INTEGER, Y INTEGER, CHECK (X + Y = 50)); We will test for the ACID properties for two columns X and Y. There is also a constraint added on the table that the sum of values in columns X and Y should always be 50. Atomicity: Here, we test that the transactions done on the table is either successful or failed. No records should be updated if the transactions fail. Consistency: Here, we test that the values in columns X and Y are updated correctly by following the constraint that the sum of these two values is always"
"50. The insertion or updation should not be allowed if the sum is not equal to 50. Isolation: Here, in the presence of multiple transactions, we need to test they are happening in isolation. Durability: Here, the test cases should consider that if a transaction has been committed, it should remain even a"
"25. How can you test the data integrity in database testing? Database Testing Interview Questions Whenever there are diﬀerent modules in the application that are using the same data and also perform diﬀerent operations on them, it is very much necessary to have the latest data to be shown everywhere. The most recent value of the data should be used by the systems. This is called Data Integrity. Following image shows 5 characteristics of data following data integrity: We can apply the following test cases for testing out the integrity of the data: Are all the triggers working fine to update the records in the reference tables? Are there any invalid data in the columns of each database? Insert wrong data into the tables and see how the insertion behaves. What would happen if you try to insert the child record before inserting the parent record in the main table? Is there any failure if you are trying to delete records referenced by another table? Are the replicated servers in sync? The data should not be out of sync in two or more replicated servers as it would defy the intent of replication."
"26. What are the most commonly occurring issues that are faced during database testing and how can they be solved? Database Testing Interview Questions Significant overhead can be involved to determine the state of transactions. Solution: Plan the process that is eﬀicient in both time and cost. A fine balance needs to be present while managing the quality of the database testing and the application project duration. Post the clean up of old test data, testers need to come up with a design of new data. Solution: Plan a methodology and design test cases that can easily take up diﬀerent data sets without much eﬀort. To validate the SQL queries, there is a need for an SQL generator that can help to validate the data and can easily help in handling diﬀerent test cases. This maintenance, if not done correctly, can result in messy and unmanageable scenarios. Solution: Overall process of testing should be well planned and the queries should be well maintained in a way that continuous updates are supported."
27. What are the best practices that need to be followed while performing database testing? Following are some good practices that need to be followed while performing database testing: Database Testing Interview Questions Validate every single piece of data that includes metadata and functional data based on the requirement specifications. Test data should be verified and created a
28. How can you validate the tables and columns in the database? We can test the tables and columns in the databases by applying the following test cases: Are the database fields mapped correctly and is compatible with the required mappings in the front-end or backend requirements? Are the fields following proper naming conventions and have lengths and sizes as per the requirements? Check if there are any unused or unmapped tables and columns. Check if the table design and the referential integrities and constraints on the columns are applied eﬀectively and are scalable to diﬀerent requirements. Database Testing Interview Questions
"29. How do you check for an error in a stored procedure consisting of 1000s of lines of code? We can test using the following methods: At compilation time, check if there are any compile-time errors. Add proper comments and loggers that would give you hints about the stages completed and help you narrow down the region of error."
30. Is it possible to have multiple primary keys in a table? No. A table can allow one composite primary key that consists of two or more columns. But it does not allow for multiple primary keys.
31. How will you fetch the values from TableA that are not present in TableB without using the NOT keyword? TableA 20 21 25 45 TableB 20 45 Database Testing Interview Questions The result should have 21 and 25. We can do it easily by using the SELECT and EXCEPT keywords as shown below: SELECT * FROM TableA EXCEPT SELECT * FROM TableB;
Python Interview Questions Python Interview Questions for Freshers Python Interview Questions for Experienced Python OOPS Interview Questions Python Pandas Interview Questions Numpy Interview Questions Python Libraries Interview Questions Python Programming Examples Python Cheat Sheet: Basic to Advanced Concepts Python Interview Questions for Freshers
"1. What is Python? What are the benefits of using Python Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language. Being a general-purpose language, it can be used to build almost any type of application with the right tools/libraries. Additionally, python supports objects, modules, threads, exception-handling, and automatic memory management which help in modelling real-world problems and building applications to solve these problems. Python Interview Questions Benefits of using Python: Python is a general-purpose programming language that has a simple, easy-to- learn syntax that emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Moreover, the language is capable of scripting, is completely open-source, and supports third-party packages encouraging modularity and code reuse. Its high-level data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, attract a huge community of developers for Rapid Application Development and deployment."
"2. What is a dynamically typed language? Before we understand a dynamically typed language, we should learn about what typing is. Typing refers to type-checking in programming languages. In a strongly- typed language, such as Python, ""1"" + 2 will result in a type error since these languages don't allow for ""type-coercion"" (implicit conversion of data types). On the other hand, a weakly-typed language, such as Javascript, will simply output ""12"" as result. Type-checking can be done at two stages - Static - Data Types are checked before execution. Dynamic - Data Types are checked during execution. Python is an interpreted language, executes each statement line by line and thus type-checking is done on the fly, during execution. Hence, Python is a Dynamically Typed Language. Python Interview Questions"
"3. What is an Interpreted language? An Interpreted language executes its statements line by line. Languages such as Python, Javascript, R, PHP, and Ruby are prime examples of Interpreted languages. Programs written in an interpreted language runs directly from the source code, with no intermediary compilation step."
"4. What is PEP 8 and why is it important? PEP stands for Python Enhancement Proposal. A PEP is an oﬀicial design document providing information to the Python community, or describing a new feature for Python or its processes. PEP 8 is especially important since it documents the style guidelines for Python Code. Apparently contributing to the Python open-source community requires you to follow these style guidelines sincerely and strictly."
"5. What is Scope in Python? Every object in Python functions within a scope. A scope is a block of code where an object in Python remains relevant. Namespaces uniquely identify all the objects inside a program. However, these namespaces also have a scope defined for them where you could use their objects without any prefix. A few examples of scope created during code execution in Python are as follows: Python Interview Questions A local scope refers to the local objects available in the current function. A global scope refers to the objects available throughout the code execution since their inception. A module-level scope refers to the global objects of the current module accessible in the program. An outermost scope refers to all the built-in names callable in the program. The objects in this scope are searched last to find the name referenced. Note: Local scope objects can be synced with global scope objects using keywords such as global."
"6. What are lists and tuples? What is the key diﬀerence between the two? Lists and Tuples are both sequence data types that can store a collection of objects in Python. The objects stored in both sequences can have diﬀerent data types. Lists are represented with square brackets ['sara', 6, 0.19], while tuples are represented with parantheses ('ansh', 5, 0.97). But what is the real diﬀerence between the two? The key diﬀerence between the two is that while lists are mutable, tuples on the other hand are immutable objects. This means that lists can be modified, appended or sliced on the go but tuples remain constant and cannot be modified in any manner. You can run the following example on Python IDLE to confirm the diﬀerence: my_tuple = ('sara', 6, 5, 0.97) my_list = ['sara', 6, 5, 0.97] print(my_tuple[0]) # output => 'sara' print(my_list[0]) # output => 'sara' my_tuple[0] = 'ansh' # modifying tuple => throws an error my_list[0] = 'ansh' # modifying list => list modified print(my_tuple[0]) # output => 'sara' print(my_list[0]) # output => 'ansh'"
"7. What are the common built-in data types in Python? Python Interview Questions There are several built-in data types in Python. Although, Python doesn't require data types to be defined explicitly during variable declarations type errors are likely to occur if the knowledge of data types and their compatibility with each other are neglected. Python provides type() and isinstance() functions to check the type of these variables. These data types can be grouped into the following categories- None Type: None keyword represents the null values in Python. Boolean equality operation can be performed using these NoneType objects. Class Name Description NoneType Represents the NULL values in Python. Numeric Types: There are three distinct numeric types - integers, floating-point numbers, and complex numbers. Additionally, booleans are a sub-type of integers. Class Name Description intStores integer literals including hex, octal and binary numbers as integers floatStores literals containing decimal values and/or exponent signs as floating-point numbers complexStores complex numbers in the form (A + Bj) and has attributes: real and imag bool Stores boolean value (True or False). Python Interview Questions Note: The standard library also includes fractions to store rational numbers and decimal to store floating-point numbers with user-defined precision. Sequence Types: According to Python Docs, there are three basic Sequence Types - lists, tuples, and range objects. Sequence types have the in and not in operators defined for their traversing their elements. These operators share the same priority as the comparison operations. Class Name Description listMutable sequence used to store collection of items. tupleImmutable sequence used to store collection of items. rangeRepresents an immutable sequence of numbers generated during execution. strImmutable sequence of Unicode code points to store textual data. Note: The standard library also includes additional types for processing:"
"1. Binary data such as bytearray bytes memoryview , and"
"2. Text strings such as str. Mapping Types: A mapping object can map hashable values to random objects in Python. Mappings objects are mutable and there is currently only one standard mapping type, the dictionary. Python Interview Questions Class Name Description dictStores comma-separated list of key: value pairs Set Types: Currently, Python has two built-in set types - set and frozenset. set type is mutable and supports methods like add() and remove(). frozenset type is immutable and can't be modified a"
"8. What is pass in Python? The pass keyword represents a null operation in Python. It is generally used for the purpose of filling up empty blocks of code which may execute during runtime but has yet to be written. Without the pass statement in the following code, we may run into some errors during code execution. def myEmptyFunc(): # do nothing pass myEmptyFunc() # nothing happens ## Without the pass keyword # File ""<stdin>"", line 3 # IndentationError: expected an indented block"
"9. What are modules and packages in Python? Python packages and Python modules are two mechanisms that allow for modular programming in Python. Modularizing has several advantages - Python Interview Questions Simplicity: Working on a single module helps you focus on a relatively small portion of the problem at hand. This makes development easier and less error- prone. Maintainability: Modules are designed to enforce logical boundaries between diﬀerent problem domains. If they are written in a manner that reduces interdependency, it is less likely that modifications in a module might impact other parts of the program. Reusability: Functions defined in a module can be easily reused by other parts of the application. Scoping: Modules typically define a separate namespace, which helps avoid confusion between identifiers from other parts of the program. Modules, in general, are simply Python files with a .py extension and can have a set of functions, classes, or variables defined and implemented. They can be imported and initialized once using the import statement. If partial functionality is needed, import the requisite classes or functions using from foo import bar. Packages allow for hierarchial structuring of the module namespace using dot notation. As, modules help avoid clashes between global variable names, in a similar manner, packages help avoid clashes between module names. Creating a package is easy since it makes use of the system's inherent file structure. So just stuﬀ the modules into a folder and there you have it, the folder name as the package name. Importing a module or its contents from this package requires the package name as prefix to the module name joined by a dot. Note: You can technically import the package as well, but alas, it doesn't import the modules within the package to the local namespace, thus, it is practically useless."
"10. What are global, protected and private attributes in Python? Python Interview Questions Global variables are public variables that are defined in the global scope. To use the variable in the global scope inside a function, we use the global keyword. Protected attributes are attributes defined with an underscore prefixed to their identifier eg. _sara. They can still be accessed and modified from outside the class they are defined in but a responsible developer should refrain from doing so. Private attributes are attributes with double underscore prefixed to their identifier eg. __a nsh. They cannot be accessed or modified from the outside directly and will result in an AttributeError if such an attempt is made."
"11. What is the use of self in Python? Self is used to represent the instance of the class. With this keyword, you can access the attributes and methods of the class in python. It binds the attributes with the given arguments. self is used in diﬀerent places and o"
"12. What is __init__? __init__ is a contructor method in Python and is automatically called to allocate memory when a new object/instance is created. All classes have a __init__ method associated with them. It helps in distinguishing methods and attributes of a class from local variables. # class definition class Student: def __init__(self, fname, lname, age, section): self.firstname = fname self.lastname = lname self.age = age self.section = section # creating a new object stu1 = Student(""Sara"", ""Ansh"", 22, ""A2"")"
"13. What is break, continue and pass in Python? Python Interview Questions Break The break statement terminates the loop immediately and the control flows to the statement a"
14. What are unit tests in Python? Python Interview Questions Unit test is a unit testing framework of Python. Unit testing means testing diﬀerent components of so
15. What is docstring in Python? Documentation string or docstring is a multiline string used to document a specific code segment. The docstring should describe what the function or method does.
"16. What is slicing in Python? As the name suggests, ‘slicing’ is taking parts of. Syntax for slicing is [start : stop : step] start is the starting index from where to slice a list or tuple stop is the ending index or where to sop. step is the number of steps to jump. Default value for start is 0, stop is number of items, step is 1. Slicing can be done on strings, arrays, lists, and tuples. numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] print(numbers[1 : : 2]) #output : [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]"
17. Explain how can you make a Python Script executable on Unix? Script file must begin with #!/usr/bin/env python
"18. What is the diﬀerence between Python Arrays and lists? Python Interview Questions Arrays in python can only contain elements of same data types i.e., data type of array should be homogeneous. It is a thin wrapper around C language arrays and consumes far less memory than lists. Lists in python can contain elements of diﬀerent data types i.e., data type of lists can be heterogeneous. It has the disadvantage of consuming large memory. Python Interview Questions for Experienced"
"19. How is memory managed in Python? Memory management in Python is handled by the Python Memory Manager. The memory allocated by the manager is in form of a private heap space dedicated to Python. All Python objects are stored in this heap and being private, it is inaccessible to the programmer. Though, python does provide some core API functions to work upon the private heap space. Additionally, Python has an in-built garbage collection to recycle the unused memory for the private heap space. import array a = array.array('i', [1, 2, 3]) for i in a: print(i, end=' ') #OUTPUT: 1 2 3 a = array.array('i', [1, 2, 'string']) #OUTPUT: TypeError: an integer is required (g a = [1, 2, 'string'] for i in a: print(i, end=' ') #OUTPUT: 1 2 string Python Interview Questions"
"20. What are Python namespaces? Why are they used? A namespace in Python ensures that object names in a program are unique and can be used without any conflict. Python implements these namespaces as dictionaries with 'name as key' mapped to a corresponding 'object as value'. This allows for multiple namespaces to use the same name and map it to a separate object. A few examples of namespaces are as follows: Local Namespace includes local names inside a function. the namespace is temporarily created for a function call and gets cleared when the function returns. Global Namespace includes names from various imported packages/ modules that are being used in the current project. This namespace is created when the package is imported in the script and lasts until the execution of the script. Built-in Namespace includes built-in functions of core Python and built-in names for various types of exceptions. The lifecycle of a namespace depends upon the scope of objects they are mapped to. If the scope of an object ends, the lifecycle of that namespace comes to an end. Hence, it isn't possible to access inner namespace objects from an outer namespace. Python Interview Questions"
"21. What is Scope Resolution in Python? Sometimes objects within the same scope have the same name but function diﬀerently. In such cases, scope resolution comes into play in Python automatically. A few examples of such behavior are: Python modules namely 'math' and 'cmath' have a lot of functions that are common to both of them - log10(), acos(), exp() etc. To resolve this ambiguity, it is necessary to prefix them with their respective module, like math.exp() and cmath.exp(). Consider the code below, an object temp has been initialized to 10 globally and then to 20 on function call. However, the function call didn't change the value of the temp globally. Here, we can observe that Python draws a clear line between global and local variables, treating their namespaces as separate identities. Python Interview Questions temp = 10 # global-scope variable def func(): temp = 20 # local-scope variable print(temp) print(temp) # output => 10 func() # output => 20 print(temp) # output => 10 This behavior can be overridden using the global keyword inside the function, as shown in the following example: temp = 10 # global-scope variable def func(): global temp temp = 20 # local-scope variable print(temp) print(temp) # output => 10 func() # output => 20 print(temp) # output => 20"
"22. What are decorators in Python? Decorators in Python are essentially functions that add functionality to an existing function in Python without changing the structure of the function itself. They are represented the @decorator_name in Python and are called in a bottom-up fashion. For example: Python Interview Questions # decorator function to convert to lowercase def lowercase_decorator(function): def wrapper(): func = function() string_lowercase = func.lower() return string_lowercase return wrapper # decorator function to split words def splitter_decorator(function): def wrapper(): func = function() string_split = func.split() return string_split return wrapper @splitter_decorator # this is executed next @lowercase_decorator # this is executed first def hello(): return 'Hello World' hello() # output => [ 'hello' , 'world' ] The beauty of the decorators lies in the fact that besides adding functionality to the output of the method, they can even accept arguments for functions and can further modify those arguments before passing it to the function itself. The inner nested function, i.e. 'wrapper' function, plays a significant role here. It is implemented to enforce encapsulation and thus, keep itself hidden from the global scope. # decorator function to capitalize names def names_decorator(function): def wrapper(arg1, arg2): arg1 = arg1.capitalize() arg2 = arg2.capitalize() string_hello = function(arg1, arg2) return string_hello return wrapper @names_decorator def say_hello(name1, name2): return 'Hello ' + name1 + '! Hello ' + name2 + '!' say_hello('sara', 'ansh') # output => 'Hello Sara! Hello Ansh!'"
"23. What are Dict and List comprehensions? Python Interview Questions Python comprehensions, like decorators, are syntactic sugar constructs that help build altered and filtered lists, dictionaries, or sets from a given list, dictionary, or set. Using comprehensions saves a lot of time and code that might be considerably more verbose (containing more lines of code). Let's check out some examples, where comprehensions can be truly beneficial: Performing mathematical operations on the entire list my_list = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11] squared_list = [x**2 for x in my_list] # list comprehension # output => [4 , 9 , 25 , 49 , 121] squared_dict = {x:x**2 for x in my_list} # dict comprehension # output => {11: 121, 2: 4 , 3: 9 , 5: 25 , 7: 49} Performing conditional filtering operations on the entire list my_list = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11] squared_list = [x**2 for x in my_list if x%2 != 0] # list comprehension # output => [9 , 25 , 49 , 121] squared_dict = {x:x**2 for x in my_list if x%2 != 0} # dict comprehension # output => {11: 121, 3: 9 , 5: 25 , 7: 49} Combining multiple lists into one Comprehensions allow for multiple iterators and hence, can be used to combine multiple lists into one. Flattening a multi-dimensional list A similar approach of nested iterators (as above) can be applied to flatten a multi- dimensional list or work upon its inner elements. a = [1, 2, 3] b = [7, 8, 9] [(x + y) for (x,y) in zip(a,b)] # parallel iterators # output => [8, 10, 12] [(x,y) for x in a for y in b] # nested iterators # output => [(1, 7), (1, 8), (1, 9), (2, 7), (2, 8), (2, 9), (3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 9)] Python Interview Questions my_list = [[10,20,30],[40,50,60],[70,80,90]] flattened = [x for temp in my_list for x in temp] # output => [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90] Note: List comprehensions have the same eﬀect as the map method in other languages. They follow the mathematical set builder notation rather than map and filter functions in Python."
"24. What is lambda in Python? Why is it used? Lambda is an anonymous function in Python, that can accept any number of arguments, but can only have a single expression. It is generally used in situations requiring an anonymous function for a short time period. Lambda functions can be used in either of the two ways: Assigning lambda functions to a variable: mul = lambda a, b : a * b print(mul(2, 5)) # output => 10 Wrapping lambda functions inside another function: def myWrapper(n): return lambda a : a * n mulFive = myWrapper(5) print(mulFive(2)) # output => 10"
"25. How do you copy an object in Python? In Python, the assignment statement (= operator) does not copy objects. Instead, it creates a binding between the existing object and the target variable name. To create copies of an object in Python, we need to use the copy module. Moreover, there are two ways of creating copies for the given object using the copy module - Python Interview Questions Shallow Copy is a bit-wise copy of an object. The copied object created has an exact copy of the values in the original object. If either of the values is a reference to other objects, just the reference addresses for the same are copied. Deep Copy copies all values recursively from source to target object, i.e. it even duplicates the objects referenced by the source object. from copy import copy, deepcopy list_1 = [1, 2, [3, 5], 4] ## shallow copy list_2 = copy(list_1) list_2[3] = 7 list_2[2].append(6) list_2 # output => [1, 2, [3, 5, 6], 7] list_1 # output => [1, 2, [3, 5, 6], 4] ## deep copy list_3 = deepcopy(list_1) list_3[3] = 8 list_3[2].append(7) list_3 # output => [1, 2, [3, 5, 6, 7], 8] list_1 # output => [1, 2, [3, 5, 6], 4]"
"26. What is the diﬀerence between xrange and range in Python? xrange() and range() are quite similar in terms of functionality. They both generate a sequence of integers, with the only diﬀerence that range() returns a Python list, whereas, xrange() returns an xrange object. So how does that make a diﬀerence? It sure does, because unlike range(), xrange() doesn't generate a static list, it creates the value on the go. This technique is commonly used with an object-type generator and has been termed as ""yielding"". Yielding is crucial in applications where memory is a constraint. Creating a static list as in range() can lead to a Memory Error in such conditions, while, xrange() can handle it optimally by using just enough memory for the generator (significantly less in comparison). Python Interview Questions for i in xrange(10): # numbers from o to 9 print i # output => 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 for i in xrange(1,10): # numbers from 1 to 9 print i # output => 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 for i in xrange(1, 10, 2): # skip by two for next print i # output => 1 3 5 7 9 Note: xrange has been deprecated as of Python 3.x. Now range does exactly the same as what xrange used to do in Python 2.x, since it was way better to use xrange() than the original range() function in Python 2.x."
"27. What is pickling and unpickling? Python library oﬀers a feature - serialization out of the box. Serializing an object refers to transforming it into a format that can be stored, so as to be able to deserialize it, later on, to obtain the original object. Here, the pickle module comes into play. Pickling: Pickling is the name of the serialization process in Python. Any object in Python can be serialized into a byte stream and dumped as a file in the memory. The process of pickling is compact but pickle objects can be compressed further. Moreover, pickle keeps track of the objects it has serialized and the serialization is portable across versions. The function used for the above process is pickle.dump(). Unpickling: Unpickling is the complete inverse of pickling. It deserializes the byte stream to recreate the objects stored in the file and loads the object to memory. The function used for the above process is pickle.load(). Note: Python has another, more primitive, serialization module called marshall, which exists primarily to support .pyc files in Python and diﬀers significantly from the pickle. Python Interview Questions"
"28. What are generators in Python? Generators are functions that return an iterable collection of items, one at a time, in a set manner. Generators, in general, are used to create iterators with a diﬀerent approach. They employ the use of yield keyword rather than return to return a generator object. Let's try and build a generator for fibonacci numbers - Python Interview Questions ## generate fibonacci numbers upto n def fib(n): p, q = 0, 1 while(p < n): yield p p, q = q, p + q x = fib(10) # create generator object ## iterating using __next__(), for Python2, use next() x.__next__() # output => 0 x.__next__() # output => 1 x.__next__() # output => 1 x.__next__() # output => 2 x.__next__() # output => 3 x.__next__() # output => 5 x.__next__() # output => 8 x.__next__() # error ## iterating using loop for i in fib(10): print(i) # output => 0 1 1 2 3 5 8"
29. What is PYTHONPATH in Python? PYTHONPATH is an environment variable which you can set to add additional directories where Python will look for modules and packages. This is especially useful in maintaining Python libraries that you do not wish to install in the global default location.
"30. What is the use of help() and dir() functions? help() function in Python is used to display the documentation of modules, classes, functions, keywords, etc. If no parameter is passed to the help() function, then an interactive help utility is launched on the console. dir() function tries to return a valid list of attributes and methods of the object it is called upon. It behaves diﬀerently with diﬀerent objects, as it aims to produce the most relevant data, rather than the complete information. For Modules/Library objects, it returns a list of all attributes, contained in that module. For Class Objects, it returns a list of all valid attributes and base attributes. With no arguments passed, it returns a list of attributes in the current scope. Python Interview Questions"
"31. What is the diﬀerence between .py and .pyc files? .py files contain the source code of a program. Whereas, .pyc file contains the bytecode of your program. We get bytecode a"
32. How Python is interpreted? Python as a language is not interpreted or compiled. Interpreted or compiled is the property of the implementation. Python is a bytecode(set of interpreter readable instructions) interpreted generally. Source code is a file with .py extension. Python compiles the source code to a set of instructions for a virtual machine. The Python interpreter is an implementation of that virtual machine. This intermediate format is called “bytecode”. .py source code is first compiled to give .pyc which is bytecode. This bytecode can be then interpreted by the oﬀicial CPython or JIT(Just in Time compiler) compiled by PyPy.
"33. How are arguments passed by value or by reference in python? Pass by value: Copy of the actual object is passed. Changing the value of the copy of the object will not change the value of the original object. Pass by reference: Reference to the actual object is passed. Changing the value of the new object will change the value of the original object. In Python, arguments are passed by reference, i.e., reference to the actual object is passed. Python Interview Questions def appendNumber(arr): arr.append(4) arr = [1, 2, 3] print(arr) #Output: => [1, 2, 3] appendNumber(arr) print(arr) #Output: => [1, 2, 3, 4]"
"34. What are iterators in Python? An iterator is an object. It remembers its state i.e., where it is during iteration (see code below to see how) __iter__() method initializes an iterator. It has a __n ext__() method which returns the next item in iteration and points to the next element. Upon reaching the end of iterable object __n ext__() must return StopIteration exception. It is also self-iterable. Iterators are objects with which we can iterate over iterable objects like lists, strings, etc. class ArrayList: def __init__(self, number_list): self.numbers = number_list def __iter__(self): self.pos = 0 return self def __next__(self): if(self.pos < len(self.numbers)): self.pos += 1 return self.numbers[self.pos - 1] else: raise StopIteration array_obj = ArrayList([1, 2, 3]) it = iter(array_obj) print(next(it)) #output: 2 print(next(it)) #output: 3 print(next(it)) #Throws Exception #Traceback (most recent call last): #... #StopIteration Python Interview Questions"
"35. Explain how to delete a file in Python? Use command os.remove(file_name) import os os.remove(""ChangedFile.csv"") print(""File Removed!"")"
"36. Explain split() and join() functions in Python? You can use split() function to split a string based on a delimiter to a list of strings. You can use join() function to join a list of strings based on a delimiter to give a single string. string = ""This is a string."" string_list = string.split(' ') #delimiter is ‘space’ character or ‘ ‘ print(string_list) #output: ['This', 'is', 'a', 'string.'] print(' '.join(string_list)) #output: This is a string."
"37. What does *args and **kwargs mean? *args *args is a special syntax used in the function definition to pass variable-length arguments. “*” means variable length and “args” is the name used by convention. You can use any other. def multiply(a, b, *argv): mul = a * b for num in argv: mul *= num return mul print(multiply(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)) #output: 120 **kwargs Python Interview Questions **kwargs is a special syntax used in the function definition to pass variable- length keyworded arguments. Here, also, “kwargs” is used just by convention. You can use any other name. Keyworded argument means a variable that has a name when passed to a function. It is actually a dictionary of the variable names and its value. def tellArguments(**kwargs): for key, value in kwargs.items(): print(key + "": "" + value) tellArguments(arg1 = ""argument 1"", arg2 = ""argument 2"", arg3 = ""argument 3"") #output: # arg1: argument 1 # arg2: argument 2 # arg3: argument 3"
"38. What are negative indexes and why are they used? Negative indexes are the indexes from the end of the list or tuple or string. Arr[-1] means the last element of array Arr[] arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] #get the last element print(arr[-1]) #output 6 #get the second last element print(arr[-2]) #output 5 Python OOPS Interview Questions"
"39. How do you create a class in Python? To create a class in python, we use the keyword “class” as shown in the example below: class InterviewbitEmployee: def __init__(self, emp_name): self.emp_name = emp_name To instantiate or create an object from the class created above, we do the following: Python Interview Questions emp_1=InterviewbitEmployee(""Mr. Employee"") To access the name attribute, we just call the attribute using the dot operator as shown below: print(emp_1.emp_name) # Prints Mr. Employee To create methods inside the class, we include the methods under the scope of the class as shown below: class InterviewbitEmployee: def __init__(self, emp_name): self.emp_name = emp_name def introduce(self): print(""Hello I am "" + self.emp_name) The self parameter in the init and introduce functions represent the reference to the current class instance which is used for accessing attributes and methods of that class. The self parameter has to be the first parameter of any method defined inside the class. The method of the class InterviewbitEmployee can be accessed as shown below: emp_1.introduce() The overall program would look like this: Python Interview Questions class InterviewbitEmployee: def __init__(self, emp_name): self.emp_name = emp_name def introduce(self): print(""Hello I am "" + self.emp_name) # create an object of InterviewbitEmployee class emp_1 = InterviewbitEmployee(""Mr Employee"") print(emp_1.emp_name) #print employee name emp_1.introduce() #introduce the employee"
"40. How does inheritance work in python? Explain it with an example. Inheritance gives the power to a class to access all attributes and methods of another class. It aids in code reusability and helps the developer to maintain applications without redundant code. The class inheriting from another class is a child class or also called a derived class. The class from which a child class derives the members are called parent class or superclass. Python supports diﬀerent kinds of inheritance, they are: Single Inheritance: Child class derives members of one parent class. Python Interview Questions # Parent class class ParentClass: def par_func(self): print(""I am parent class function"") # Child class class ChildClass(ParentClass): def child_func(self): print(""I am child class function"") # Driver code obj1 = ChildClass() obj1.par_func() obj1.child_func() Multi-level Inheritance: The members of the parent class, A, are inherited by child class which is then inherited by another child class, B. The features of the base class and the derived class are further inherited into the new derived class, C. Here, A is the grandfather class of class C. Python Interview Questions Python Interview Questions # Parent class class A: def __init__(self, a_name): self.a_name = a_name # Intermediate class class B(A): def __init__(self, b_name, a_name): self.b_name = b_name # invoke constructor of class A A.__init__(self, a_name) # Child class class C(B): def __init__(self,c_name, b_name, a_name): self.c_name = c_name # invoke constructor of class B B.__init__(self, b_name, a_name) def display_names(self): print(""A name : "", self.a_name) print(""B name : "", self.b_name) print(""C name : "", self.c_name) # Driver code obj1 = C('child', 'intermediate', 'parent') print(obj1.a_name) obj1.display_names() Multiple Inheritance: This is achieved when one child class derives members from more than one parent class. All features of parent classes are inherited in the child class. Python Interview Questions # Parent class1 class Parent1: def parent1_func(self): print(""Hi I am first Parent"") # Parent class2 class Parent2: def parent2_func(self): print(""Hi I am second Parent"") # Child class class Child(Parent1, Parent2): def child_func(self): self.parent1_func() self.parent2_func() # Driver's code obj1 = Child() obj1.child_func() Hierarchical Inheritance: When a parent class is derived by more than one child class, it is called hierarchical inheritance. Python Interview Questions # Base class class A: def a_func(self): print(""I am from the parent class."") # 1st Derived class class B(A): def b_func(self): print(""I am from the first child."") # 2nd Derived class class C(A): def c_func(self): print(""I am from the second child."") # Driver's code obj1 = B() obj2 = C() obj1.a_func() obj1.b_func() #child 1 method obj2.a_func() obj2.c_func() #child 2 method"
"41. How do you access parent members in the child class? Python Interview Questions Following are the ways using which you can access parent class members within a child class: By using Parent class name: You can use the name of the parent class to access the attributes as shown in the example below: class Parent(object): # Constructor def __init__(self, name): self.name = name class Child(Parent): # Constructor def __init__(self, name, age): Parent.name = name self.age = age def display(self): print(Parent.name, self.age) # Driver Code obj = Child(""Interviewbit"", 6) obj.display() By using super(): The parent class members can be accessed in child class using the super keyword. Python Interview Questions class Parent(object): # Constructor def __init__(self, name): self.name = name class Child(Parent): # Constructor def __init__(self, name, age): ''' In Python 3.x, we can also use super().__init__(name) ''' super(Child, self).__init__(name) self.age = age def display(self): # Note that Parent.name cant be used # here since super() is used in the constructor print(self.name, self.age) # Driver Code obj = Child(""Interviewbit"", 6) obj.display()"
"42. Are access specifiers used in python? Python does not make use of access specifiers specifically like private, public, protected, etc. However, it does not derive this from any variables. It has the concept of imitating the behaviour of variables by making use of a single (protected) or double underscore (private) as prefixed to the variable names. By default, the variables without prefixed underscores are public. Example: Python Interview Questions # to demonstrate access specifiers class InterviewbitEmployee: # protected members _emp_name = None _age = None # private members __branch = None # constructor def __init__(self, emp_name, age, branch): self._emp_name = emp_name self._age = age self.__branch = branch #public member def display(): print(self._emp_name +"" ""+self._age+"" ""+self.__branch)"
"43. Is it possible to call parent class without its instance creation? Yes, it is possible if the base class is instantiated by other child classes or if the base class is a static method."
"44. How is an empty class created in python? An empty class does not have any members defined in it. It is created by using the pass keyword (the pass command does nothing in python). We can create objects for this class outside the class. For example- class EmptyClassDemo: pass obj=EmptyClassDemo() obj.name=""Interviewbit"" print(""Name created= "",obj.name) Output: Name created = Interviewbit Python Interview Questions"
45. Diﬀerentiate between new and override modifiers. The new modifier is used to instruct the compiler to use the new implementation and not the base class function. The Override modifier is useful for overriding a base class function inside the child class.
46. Why is finalize used? Finalize method is used for freeing up the unmanaged resources and clean up before the garbage collection method is invoked. This helps in performing memory management tasks.
47. What is init method in python? The init method works similarly to the constructors in Java. The method is run as soon as an object is instantiated. It is useful for initializing any attributes or default behaviour of the object at the time of instantiation. For example:
"48. How will you check if a class is a child of another class? This is done by using a method called issubclass() provided by python. The method tells us if any class is a child of another class by returning true or false accordingly. For example: class InterviewbitEmployee: # init method / constructor def __init__(self, emp_name): self.emp_name = emp_name # introduce method def introduce(self): print('Hello, I am ', self.emp_name) emp = InterviewbitEmployee('Mr Employee') # __init__ method is called here and initi emp.introduce() Python Interview Questions class Parent(object): pass class Child(Parent): pass # Driver Code print(issubclass(Child, Parent)) #True print(issubclass(Parent, Child)) #False We can check if an object is an instance of a class by making use of isinstance() method: obj1 = Child() obj2 = Parent() print(isinstance(obj2, Child)) #False print(isinstance(obj2, Parent)) #True Python Pandas Interview Questions"
"49. What do you know about pandas? Pandas is an open-source, python-based library used in data manipulation applications requiring high performance. The name is derived from “Panel Data” having multidimensional data. This was developed in 2008 by Wes McKinney and was developed for data analysis. Pandas are useful in performing 5 major steps of data analysis - Load the data, clean/manipulate it, prepare it, model it, and analyze the data."
"50. Define pandas dataframe. A dataframe is a 2D mutable and tabular structure for representing data labelled with axes - rows and columns. The syntax for creating dataframe: import pandas as pd dataframe = pd.DataFrame( data, index, columns, dtype) where: Python Interview Questions data - Represents various forms like series, map, ndarray, lists, dict etc. index - Optional argument that represents an index to row labels. columns - Optional argument for column labels. Dtype - the data type of each column. Again optional."
"51. How will you combine diﬀerent pandas dataframes? The dataframes can be combines using the below approaches: append() method: This is used to stack the dataframes horizontally. Syntax: df1.append(df2) concat() method: This is used to stack dataframes vertically. This is best used when the dataframes have the same columns and similar fields. Syntax: pd.concat([df1, df2]) join() method: This is used for extracting data from various dataframes having one or more common columns. df1.join(df2)"
"52. Can you create a series from the dictionary object in pandas? One dimensional array capable of storing diﬀerent data types is called a series. We can create pandas series from a dictionary object as shown below: Python Interview Questions import pandas as pd dict_info = {'key1' : 2.0, 'key2' : 3.1, 'key3' : 2.2} series_obj = pd.Series(dict_info) print (series_obj) Output: x 2.0 y 3.1 z 2.2 dtype: float64 If an index is not specified in the input method, then the keys of the dictionaries are sorted in ascending order for constructing the index. In case the index is passed, then values of the index label will be extracted from the dictionary."
53. How will you identify and deal with missing values in a dataframe? We can identify if a dataframe has missing values by using the isnull() and isna() methods. missing_data_count=df.isnull().sum() We can handle missing values by either replacing the values in the column with 0 as follows: df[‘column_name’].fillna(0) Or by replacing it with the mean value of the column df[‘column_name’] = df[‘column_name’].fillna((df[‘column_name’].mean()))
"54. What do you understand by reindexing in pandas? Python Interview Questions Reindexing is the process of conforming a dataframe to a new index with optional filling logic. If the values are missing in the previous index, then NaN/NA is placed in the location. A new object is returned unless a new index is produced that is equivalent to the current one. The copy value is set to False. This is also used for changing the index of rows and columns in the dataframe."
"55. How to add new column to pandas dataframe? A new column can be added to a pandas dataframe as follows: import pandas as pd data_info = {'first' : pd.Series([1, 2, 3], index=['a', 'b', 'c']), 'second' : pd.Series([1, 2, 3, 4], index=['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'])} df = pd.DataFrame(data_info) #To add new column third df['third']=pd.Series([10,20,30],index=['a','b','c']) print (df) #To add new column fourth df['fourth']=df['first']+info['third'] print (df)"
"56. How will you delete indices, rows and columns from a dataframe? To delete an Index: Execute del df.index.name for removing the index by name. Alternatively, the df.index.name can be assigned to None. For example, if you have the below dataframe: Column 1 Names John 1 Jack 2 Judy 3 Jim 4 To drop the index name “Names”: Python Interview Questions df.index.name = None # Or run the below: # del df.index.name print(df) Column 1 John 1 Jack 2 Judy 3 Jim 4 To delete row/column from dataframe: drop() method is used to delete row/column from dataframe. The axis argument is passed to the drop method where if the value is 0, it indicates to drop/delete a row and if 1 it has to drop the column. Additionally, we can try to delete the rows/columns in place by setting the value of inplace to True. This makes sure that the job is done without the need for reassignment. The duplicate values from the row/column can be deleted by using the drop_duplicates() method. Python Interview Questions"
"57. Can you get items of series A that are not available in another series B? This can be achieved by using the ~ (not/negation symbol) and isin() method as shown below. import pandas as pd df1 = pd.Series([2, 4, 8, 10, 12]) df2 = pd.Series([8, 12, 10, 15, 16]) df1=df1[~df1.isin(df2)] print(df1) """""" Output: 0 2 1 4 dtype: int64 """""""
"58. How will you get the items that are not common to both the given series A and B? We can achieve this by first performing the union of both series, then taking the intersection of both series. Then we follow the approach of getting items of union that are not there in the list of the intersection. Python Interview Questions The following code demonstrates this: import pandas as pd import numpy as np df1 = pd.Series([2, 4, 5, 8, 10]) df2 = pd.Series([8, 10, 13, 15, 17]) p_union = pd.Series(np.union1d(df1, df2)) # union of series p_intersect = pd.Series(np.intersect1d(df1, df2)) # intersection of series unique_elements = p_union[~p_union.isin(p_intersect)] print(unique_elements) """""" Output: 0 2 1 4 2 5 5 13 6 15 7 17 dtype: int64 """""""
"59. While importing data from diﬀerent sources, can the pandas library recognize dates? Python Interview Questions Yes, they can, but with some bit of help. We need to add the parse_dates argument while we are reading data from the sources. Consider an example where we read data from a CSV file, we may encounter diﬀerent date-time formats that are not readable by the pandas library. In this case, pandas provide flexibility to build our custom date parser with the help of lambda functions as shown below: Numpy Interview Questions"
"60. What do you understand by NumPy? NumPy is one of the most popular, easy-to-use, versatile, open-source, python-based, general-purpose package that is used for processing arrays. NumPy is short for NUMerical PYthon. This is very famous for its highly optimized tools that result in high performance and powerful N-Dimensional array processing feature that is designed explicitly to work on complex arrays. Due to its popularity and powerful performance and its flexibility to perform various operations like trigonometric operations, algebraic and statistical computations, it is most commonly used in performing scientific computations and various broadcasting functions. The following image shows the applications of NumPy: import pandas as pd from datetime import datetime dateparser = lambda date_val: datetime.strptime(date_val, '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S') df = pd.read_csv(""some_file.csv"", parse_dates=['datetime_column'], date_parser=datepars Python Interview Questions"
"61. How are NumPy arrays advantageous over python lists? The list data structure of python is very highly eﬀicient and is capable of performing various functions. But, they have severe limitations when it comes to the computation of vectorized operations which deals with element-wise multiplication and addition. The python lists also require the information regarding the type of every element which results in overhead as type dispatching code gets executes every time any operation is performed on any element. This is where the NumPy arrays come into the picture as all the limitations of python lists are handled in NumPy arrays. Additionally, as the size of the NumPy arrays increases, NumPy becomes around 30x times faster than the Python List. This is because the Numpy arrays are densely packed in the memory due to their homogenous nature. This ensures the memory free up is also faster."
"62. What are the steps to create 1D, 2D and 3D arrays? 1D array creation: Python Interview Questions import numpy as np one_dimensional_list = [1,2,4] one_dimensional_arr = np.array(one_dimensional_list) print(""1D array is : "",one_dimensional_arr) 2D array creation: import numpy as np two_dimensional_list=[[1,2,3],[4,5,6]] two_dimensional_arr = np.array(two_dimensional_list) print(""2D array is : "",two_dimensional_arr) 3D array creation: import numpy as np three_dimensional_list=[[[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]] three_dimensional_arr = np.array(three_dimensional_list) print(""3D array is : "",three_dimensional_arr) ND array creation: This can be achieved by giving the ndmin attribute. The below example demonstrates the creation of a 6D array: import numpy as np ndArray = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4], ndmin=6) print(ndArray) print('Dimensions of array:', ndArray.ndim)"
"63. You are given a numpy array and a new column as inputs. How will you delete the second column and replace the column with a new column value? Example: Given array: [[35 53 63] [72 12 22] [43 84 56]] Python Interview Questions New Column values: [ 20 30 40 ] Solution: import numpy as np #inputs inputArray = np.array([[35,53,63],[72,12,22],[43,84,56]]) new_col = np.array([[20,30,40]]) # delete 2nd column arr = np.delete(inputArray , 1, axis = 1) #insert new_col to array arr = np.insert(arr , 1, new_col, axis = 1) print (arr)"
"64. How will you eﬀiciently load data from a text file? We can use the method numpy.loadtxt() which can automatically read the file’s header and footer lines and the comments if any. This method is highly eﬀicient and even if this method feels less eﬀicient, then the data should be represented in a more eﬀicient format such as CSV etc. Various alternatives can be considered depending on the version of NumPy used. Following are the file formats that are supported: Python Interview Questions Text files: These files are generally very slow, huge but portable and are human- readable. Raw binary: This file does not have any metadata and is not portable. But they are fast. Pickle: These are borderline slow and portable but depends on the NumPy versions. HDF5: This is known as the High-Powered Kitchen Sink format which supports both PyTables and h5py format. .npy: This is NumPy's native binary data format which is extremely simple, eﬀicient and portable."
"65. How will you read CSV data into an array in NumPy? This can be achieved by using the genfromtxt() method by setting the delimiter as a comma. from numpy import genfromtxt csv_data = genfromtxt('sample_file.csv', delimiter=',')"
"66. How will you sort the array based on the Nth column? For example, consider an array arr. arr = np.array([[8, 3, 2], [3, 6, 5], [6, 1, 4]]) Let us try to sort the rows by the 2nd column so that we get: [[6, 1, 4], [8, 3, 2], [3, 6, 5]] We can do this by using the sort() method in numpy as: Python Interview Questions import numpy as np arr = np.array([[8, 3, 2], [3, 6, 5], [6, 1, 4]]) #sort the array using np.sort arr = np.sort(arr.view('i8,i8,i8'), order=['f1'], axis=0).view(np.int) We can also perform sorting and that too inplace sorting by doing: arr.view('i8,i8,i8').sort(order=['f1'], axis=0)"
"67. How will you find the nearest value in a given numpy array? We can use the argmin() method of numpy as shown below: import numpy as np def find_nearest_value(arr, value): arr = np.asarray(arr) idx = (np.abs(arr - value)).argmin() return arr[idx] #Driver code arr = np.array([ 0.21169, 0.61391, 0.6341, 0.0131, 0.16541, 0.5645, 0.5742]) value = 0.52 print(find_nearest_value(arr, value)) # Prints 0.5645"
"68. How will you reverse the numpy array using one line of code? This can be done as shown in the following: reversed_array = arr[::-1] where arr = original given array, reverse_array is the resultant a"
"69. How will you find the shape of any given NumPy array? Python Interview Questions We can use the shape attribute of the numpy array to find the shape. It returns the shape of the array in terms of row count and column count of the array. import numpy as np arr_two_dim = np.array([(""x1"",""x2"", ""x3"",""x4""), (""x5"",""x6"", ""x7"",""x8"" )]) arr_one_dim = np.array([3,2,4,5,6]) # find and print shape print(""2-D Array Shape: "", arr_two_dim.shape) print(""1-D Array Shape: "", arr_one_dim.shape) """""" Output: 2-D Array Shape: (2, 4) 1-D Array Shape: (5,) """""" Python Libraries Interview Questions"
"70. Diﬀerentiate between a package and a module in python. The module is a single python file. A module can import other modules (other python files) as objects. Whereas, a package is the folder/directory where diﬀerent sub- packages and the modules reside. A python module is created by saving a file with the extension of .py. This file will have classes and functions that are reusable in the code as well as across modules. A python package is created by following the below steps: Create a directory and give a valid name that represents its operation. Place modules of one kind in this directory. Create __init__.py file in this directory. This lets python know the directory we created is a package. The contents of this package can be imported across diﬀerent modules in other packages to reuse the functionality."
"71. What are some of the most commonly used built-in modules in Python? Python modules are the files having python code which can be functions, variables or classes. These go by .py extension. The most commonly available built-in modules are: Python Interview Questions os math sys random re datetime JSON"
"72. What are lambda functions? Lambda functions are generally inline, anonymous functions represented by a single expression. They are used for creating function objects during runtime. They can accept any number of parameters. They are usually used where functions are required only for a short period. They can be used as: mul_func = lambda x,y : x*y print(mul_func(6, 4)) # Output: 24"
"73. How can you generate random numbers? Python provides a module called random using which we can generate random numbers. We have to import a random module and call the random() method as shown below: The random() method generates float values lying between 0 and 1 randomly. import random print(random.random()) To generate customised random numbers between specified ranges, we can use the randrange() method Syntax: randrange(beginning, end, step) For example: Python Interview Questions import random print(random.randrange(5,100,2))"
"74. Can you easily check if all characters in the given string is alphanumeric? This can be easily done by making use of the isalnum() method that returns true in case the string has only alphanumeric characters. For Example - ""abdc1321"".isalnum() #Output: True ""xyz@123$"".isalnum() #Output: False Another way is to use match() method from the re (regex) module as shown: import re print(bool(re.match('[A-Za-z0-9]+$','abdc1321'))) # Output: True print(bool(re.match('[A-Za-z0-9]+$','xyz@123$'))) # Output: False"
"75. What are the diﬀerences between pickling and unpickling? Pickling is the conversion of python objects to binary form. Whereas, unpickling is the conversion of binary form data to python objects. The pickled objects are used for storing in disks or external memory locations. Unpickled objects are used for getting the data back as python objects upon which processing can be done in python. Python provides a pickle module for achieving this. Pickling uses the pickle.dump() method to dump python objects into disks. Unpickling uses the pickle.load() method to get back the data as python objects. Python Interview Questions"
"76. Define GIL. GIL stands for Global Interpreter Lock. This is a mutex used for limiting access to python objects and aids in eﬀective thread synchronization by avoiding deadlocks. GIL helps in achieving multitasking (and not parallel computing). The following diagram represents how GIL works. Python Interview Questions Based on the above diagram, there are three threads. First Thread acquires the GIL first and starts the I/O execution. When the I/O operations are done, thread 1 releases the acquired GIL which is then taken up by the second thread. The process repeats and the GIL are used by diﬀerent threads alternatively until the threads have completed their execution. The threads not having the GIL lock goes into the waiting state and resumes execution only when it acquires the lock."
"77. Define PYTHONPATH. It is an environment variable used for incorporating additional directories during the import of a module or a package. PYTHONPATH is used for checking if the imported packages or modules are available in the existing directories. Not just that, the interpreter uses this environment variable to identify which module needs to be loaded."
"78. Define PIP. PIP stands for Python Installer Package. As the name indicates, it is used for installing diﬀerent python modules. It is a command-line tool providing a seamless interface for installing diﬀerent python modules. It searches over the internet for the package and installs them into the working directory without the need for any interaction with the user. The syntax for this is: pip install <package_name>"
"79. Are there any tools for identifying bugs and performing static analysis in python? Yes, there are tools like PyChecker and Pylint which are used as static analysis and linting tools respectively. PyChecker helps find bugs in python source code files and raises alerts for code issues and their complexity. Pylint checks for the module’s coding standards and supports diﬀerent plugins to enable custom features to meet this requirement."
80. Diﬀerentiate between deep and shallow copies. Python Interview Questions Shallow copy does the task of creating new objects storing references of original elements. This does not undergo recursion to create copies of nested objects. It just copies the reference details of nested objects. Deep copy creates an independent and new copy of an object and even copies all the nested objects of the original element recursively.
"81. What is main function in python? How do you invoke it? In the world of programming languages, the main is considered as an entry point of execution for a program. But in python, it is known that the interpreter serially interprets the file line-by-line. This means that python does not provide main() function explicitly. But this doesn't mean that we cannot simulate the execution of main. This can be done by defining user-defined main() function and by using the __name__ property of python file. This __name__ variable is a special built-in variable that points to the name of the current module. This can be done as shown below: def main(): print(""Hi Interviewbit!"") if __name__==""__main__"": main() Python Programming Examples"
"82. Write python function which takes a variable number of arguments. A function that takes variable arguments is called a function prototype. Syntax: def function_name(*arg_list) For example: Python Interview Questions def func(*var): for i in var: print(i) func(1) func(20,1,6) The * in the function argument represents variable arguments in the function."
"83. WAP (Write a program) which takes a sequence of numbers and check if all numbers are unique. You can do this by converting the list to set by using set() method and comparing the length of this set with the length of the original list. If found equal, return True. def check_distinct(data_list): if len(data_list) == len(set(data_list)): return True else: return False; print(check_distinct([1,6,5,8])) #Prints True print(check_distinct([2,2,5,5,7,8])) #Prints False"
"84. Write a program for counting the number of every character of a given text file. The idea is to use collections and pprint module as shown below: import collections import pprint with open(""sample_file.txt"", 'r') as data: count_data = collections.Counter(data.read().upper()) count_value = pprint.pformat(count_data) print(count_value)"
"85. Write a program to check and return the pairs of a given array A whose sum value is equal to a target value N. Python Interview Questions This can be done easily by using the phenomenon of hashing. We can use a hash map to check for the current value of the array, x. If the map has the value of (N-x), then there is our pair. def print_pairs(arr, N): # hash set hash_set = set() for i in range(0, len(arr)): val = N-arr[i] if (val in hash_set): #check if N-x is there in set, print the pair print(""Pairs "" + str(arr[i]) + "", "" + str(val)) hash_set.add(arr[i]) # driver code arr = [1, 2, 40, 3, 9, 4] N = 3 print_pairs(arr, N)"
"86. Write a Program to add two integers >0 without using the plus operator. We can use bitwise operators to achieve this. def add_nums(num1, num2): while num2 != 0: data = num1 & num2 num1 = num1 ^ num2 num2 = data << 1 return num1 print(add_nums(2, 10))"
"87. Write a Program to solve the given equation assuming that a,b,c,m,n,o are constants: ax + by = c mx + ny = o By solving the equation, we get: Python Interview Questions a, b, c, m, n, o = 5, 9, 4, 7, 9, 4 temp = a*n - b*m if n != 0: x = (c*n - b*o) / temp y = (a*o - m*c) / temp print(str(x), str(y))"
"88. Write a Program to match a string that has the letter ‘a’ followed by 4 to 8 'b’s. We can use the re module of python to perform regex pattern comparison here. import re def match_text(txt_data): pattern = 'ab{4,8}' if re.search(pattern, txt_data): #search for pattern in txt_data return 'Match found' else: return('Match not found') print(match_text(""abc"")) #prints Match not found print(match_text(""aabbbbbc"")) #prints Match found"
"89. Write a Program to convert date from yyyy-mm-dd format to dd-mm-yyyy format. We can again use the re module to convert the date string as shown below: import re def transform_date_format(date): return re.sub(r'(\\d{4})-(\\d{1,2})-(\\d{1,2})', '\\\\3-\\\\2-\\\\1', date) date_input = ""2021-08-01"" print(transform_date_format(date_input)) You can also use the datetime module as shown below: from datetime import datetime new_date = datetime.strptime(""2021-08-01"", ""%Y-%m-%d"").strftime(""%d:%m:%Y"") print(new_data) Python Interview Questions"
"90. Write a Program to combine two diﬀerent dictionaries. While combining, if you find the same keys, you can add the values of these same keys. Output the new dictionary We can use the Counter method from the collections module from collections import Counter d1 = {'key1': 50, 'key2': 100, 'key3':200} d2 = {'key1': 200, 'key2': 100, 'key4':300} new_dict = Counter(d1) + Counter(d2) print(new_dict)"

This service gives you the ability to securely store not just your own data but also the data generated by your apps, as well as the data generated by your customers. GCP (Google Cloud Platform) Interview Questions"
"17. What are GCP Objects? Object versioning makes it possible to restore deleted or overwritten data. This includes entire databases. Object versioning causes an increase in storage costs, but it also safeguards the objects, preventing them from being mistakenly deleted or replaced. When object versioning is enabled in a Google Cloud Storage (GCP) bucket, a historical copy of the item is saved anytime it is modified or removed. This happens regardless of whether the item is being kept or deleted. Generation and meta- generation are the qualities that are utilized to figure out which form of an object is being referred to in a certain context. The term ""generation"" refers to the process of creating material, whereas ""metageneration"" refers to the process of creating metadata."
"18. What is serverless computing? Serverless computing is made possible by cloud service providers who maintain a server in the cloud and dynamically allocate resources to customers. Because the provider is responsible for the underlying hardware, the user is free to concentrate on their task without being distracted by concerns about the system's workings. GCP (Google Cloud Platform) Interview Questions The costs that are linked with the users' utilization of the resource are anticipated to be covered by them. The deployment procedure is simplified for end users as a result, and they no longer need to worry about scalability or maintenance. This falls under the category of ""utility computing."""
"19. Please explain about Cloud-based load balancing. Load balancing refers to the process of dividing up tasks and resources between all of the cloud's accessible servers in an equitable manner. This helps in obtaining high performance at reduced costs by carefully managing the requirements of the workload as well as the distribution of the available resources. Scalability and flexibility are utilized so that supply and demand can be more eﬀectively matched. In addition to this, it is utilized for the purpose of monitoring the health of the cloud service on its own.

This ensures the security of all services."
"25. What does it mean by ""Object Versioning""? Recovery of unintentionally overwritten or destroyed data is made feasible through object versioning. To secure the safety of objects when they are rewritten or removed, versioning them incurs additional storage expenses. When object versioning is set on in a GCP bucket, anytime an object is removed or replaced, a unique version of the object is created. Generation and meta-generation attributes are used to determine the specific iteration of an object. A generation recognises the production of new content, whereas a metageneration recognises the production of new metadata."
"26. Diﬀerentiate between elasticity and scalability. One of the most important aspects of cloud computing is its scalability, which enables it to boost the number of resources it can provide in reaction to an increase in demand for those resources. When there is an increase in the demand for traﬀic, the design can be scaled up to provide the additional resources that are required. Elasticity, on the other hand, is a property that enables the instantaneous assembly and disassembly of enormous amounts of available resources. It is contingent on the quantity and duration of the resources that are accessible."
"27. What is the connection between the Google Compute Engine and the Google App Engine? The Google App Engine and the Google Compute Engine each have a great deal to contribute to one another.

GCP (Google Cloud Platform) Interview Questions This is an example of a Google Cloud Platform interview question and answer that is considered to be one of the most fundamental. The following is a condensed version of the information that was used to answer this question. Google has developed a platform called Google Cloud Platform specifically for those who are interested in capitalizing on the various benefits that come with cloud computing. Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is a platform that oﬀers a wide variety of services in the field of cloud computing. These services include compute, database, storage, migration, and networking."
"36. How much does it cost to use Google Cloud Platform? What kind of payment options are there? Users who use Google Compute Engine are charged for the amount of time they spend using Google Cloud Platform based on the amount of storage space, network traﬀic, and compute instances they consume. The cost of running a virtual machine on Google Cloud is calculated on a per-second basis, with a minimum charge of one minute. Your storage price will ultimately be determined by the total amount of data you have in your account. The total amount of money spent on the network is directly proportional to the total amount of data that was exchanged between the virtual machines (VMs) that were interacting with one another. You should familiarize yourself with the various price structures utilized by Google before going in for an interview with Google Cloud Platform if you want to do well."
"37. How precisely are you going to diﬀerentiate between a Project Id and a Project Number? The project identifier and the project number are the two components that can be utilized to generate a one-of-a-kind identifier for a certain endeavour. It is possible to diﬀerentiate between them both by - GCP (Google Cloud Platform) Interview Questions In contrast to the user-generated project number, the project number is automatically produced whenever a new project is formed. The user is responsible for producing the project number. Although the project id is not required for many of our services, we do require the project number (but it is a must for the Google Compute Engine). In the event that you are interviewing to become a Google Cloud Engineer, this is an excellent illustration of a question that is straightforward yet has the potential to be significant. Therefore, it is absolutely necessary to go through the fundamentals of projects before heading for the interview with Google Cloud."
"38. How do you propose getting a larger quota for the project? Every Google Compute Engine project has a default allocation of resources that is assigned to it. There is also the possibility of increasing quotas on a project-by- project basis. On the quota tab of the Google Cloud Platform Console, one is able to observe the various limits that are currently in place for the project. If you discover that the quota limit for your account has been reached and you would like to make a request for more resources, you can do so through the quotas page found in the IAM. You can quickly and easily ask for extra allocation by clicking on the Edit Quotas link that is located in the top right corner of the page. These Google Cloud interview questions might be asked of you during an interview for the Google Cloud Architect position or the Google Cloud Consultant position. You need to put in a lot of eﬀort studying if you want to do well in the interview."
"39. Imagine that you have uninstalled your instance inadvertently. Have faith that you will be successful in regaining possession of it. Is this true, and if so, how is it even conceivable? The response is deceptively basic, although it does require an in-depth understanding of the cloud infrastructure of Google. The answer provided here is an eﬀective response to one of the most challenging Google Cloud Platform interview questions. GCP (Google Cloud Platform) Interview Questions When an instance is deleted, there is no way to retrieve it again once it has been removed. Restarting it will bring it back to life if it was paused at any point during the process."
"40. What is meant by the term ""instance"" when referring to the Google Cloud? In the Google Cloud dashboard, a single project can be associated with many instances, and each instance can be associated with a diﬀerent number of projects. When creating instances for a project, you have the option of using a diverse selection of operating systems and hardware architectures. When you delete an instance, it is removed from the project entirely and never returns. Each instance of Compute Engine comes pre-configured with a small boot persistent CD on which the operating system is pre-installed. This is a standard feature. You have the option of adding more storage options to your instance if the data storage needs of your applications require more capacity than you currently have available."
"41. Explain ""Google Cloud Machine Images""? The answer to this question is that the Google Cloud Platform already has the capability to save one-of-a-kind photos thanks to the applications that are preinstalled on the platform. Machine Images, a brand-new feature that is now in beta testing, contain all of the setup parameters, including permissions, in contrast to a custom image, which is merely an image of a disc. There may be more than one disc in machine photographs. Utilizing pictures of diﬀerent types of machinery can help you accomplish two diﬀerent objectives. There is a second one available in case the first one is damaged. With the diﬀerential disc backup characteristics of machine images, a VM snapshot can be saved while using up less space on the disc and operating more eﬀectively. This is made possible by the machine images. It is also possible to use it as a model for the creation of new virtual machines (VMs). By making use of an override, the image's characteristics can be customized in a unique manner for each copy. GCP (Google Cloud Platform) Interview Questions"
"42. What does it mean for a virtual machine to be preemptible in GCP? The correct response is that normal preemptible VM instances are anywhere from 60- 91% less expensive than standard VMs. On the other hand, Compute Engine may choose to shut down (also known as ""preempt"") particular VMs in order to free up additional resources for use by other VMs. It is not always possible to access preemptible instances because doing so requires additional resources from Google Compute Engine. Preemptible virtual machines (VMs) need a specific amount of CPU time in order to execute, just like conventional virtual machines need. You can consider requesting a separate ""Preemptible CPU"" allocation in order to prevent your preemptible virtual machines (VMs) from consuming too much of the CPU allotment that is reserved for your regular VMs. While a Compute Engine standard CPU quota continues to be in force for all standard virtual machines in a particular region, a Compute Engine preemptible CPU quota applies to all preemptible virtual machines in that region. It is possible to use the standard CPU quota instead of the preemptible CPU quota when installing preemptible virtual machines onto a host that does not have a preemptible CPU quota. Additionally, you will require some usual extras, such as Internet Protocol (IP) and storage space. Only once Compute Engine has assigned a limit will it appear in the gcloud CLI or Cloud console quota pages as a preemptible CPU limit. This is the case regardless of whether you use the console or the CLI."
"43. What is Autoscaling in the GCP Environment? GCP (Google Cloud Platform) Interview Questions In response to your inquiry, I can tell you that autoscaling is a feature that is available on the Google Cloud Platform within the controlled instance groups. A ""managed instance group"" is a collection of linked instances that have been derived from the same master template. These instances have been grouped together for management purposes. Please refer to the article on Instance Groups for any additional information regarding managed instance groups. One of the many ways that autoscaling can be accomplished with Avi Vantage is by adjusting the number of active virtual machines to correspond with the amount of processing power that is required by each individual machine. This is the simplest method. It is possible to construct auto-scale groups for either a single zone or numerous zones (regional). The availability of your application's instances can be increased for users by spreading them out across a number of diﬀerent zones. A managed instance group that serves a region will not generate instances in more than those three availability zones, even if the area contains more than three availability zones. When creating instances, you are not restricted to the use of simply the three-zone setup; instead, you have the option of using either the two-zone setup or the multi-zone setup."
"44. What does it mean when people refer to ""vertex AI"" in relation to Google Cloud? As a result of this, Vertex AI consolidates AutoML and AI Platform into a cohesive collection of application programming interfaces (APIs), client libraries, and user interfaces. Vertex AI provides users with access to AutoML as well as customizable training methods. A"
"45. Explain what Google's Distributed Cloud is. GCP (Google Cloud Platform) Interview Questions It is feasible to migrate or upgrade programs and process data on-premises by utilizing a number of Google Cloud services, such as databases, machine learning, data analytics, and container management services. It is doable to make use of services provided by a third party. Any one of these four locations—network Google's edge, an Operator data center, a Customer data center, or a Client data center—is capable of hosting the operation of Google Distributed Cloud products. The Google Distributed Cloud products can be run from any one of these four locations, making them all viable options. The shi"
"46. What is the GKE Autopilot? In the years that have passed since its initial release, Google's Kubernetes has established itself as the industry standard for container orchestration within businesses. Google Kubernetes Engine is utilized by businesses that place the utmost importance on their applications to maintain the greatest levels of dependability, security, and scalability (GKE). GCP (Google Cloud Platform) Interview Questions In the second quarter of 2020, more than one hundred thousand companies all around the world utilized at least one of our application modernization platforms or services, such as GKE. Up until quite recently, optimizing Kubernetes typically required a significant amount of manual configuration. You can now focus on your programme without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure now that GKE Autopilot, the new mode of operation for managed Kubernetes, is ready. Kubernetes and Google Container Engine (GKE) are wonderful options for many companies since they oﬀer powerful and versatile cluster management along with complete administrative access. For some people, the level of control and flexibility may be excessive or daunting in relation to the amount of work they have to do, while for others, it may represent a straightforward method for generating a more secure and consistent atmosphere in which to create. Because it maintains the cluster's architecture, control plane, and nodes, the autopilot may make it possible for businesses to install Kubernetes and streamline operations. This is because Kubernetes is a container orchestration system."
"47. What is the Kubernetes platform that Google uses? Students will learn how to construct containerized applications and deploy them using Google Kubernetes Engine by taking this course (GKE). Participants investigate and install diﬀerent components of the solution, such as infrastructure pieces like pods and containers, through a combination of talks, live demos, and hands-on laboratories."
"48. What does it mean to have ""binary authorization"" in the Google cloud? The Binary Authorization is utilized by both Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) and Cloud Run to verify that only legitimate container images are deployed. This is done to prevent any errors from occurring. You may ensure that only photographs that have been signed by reputable authorities were used in production by utilizing Binary Authorization, which enables you to enforce signature validation during the deployment phase. GCP (Google Cloud Platform) Interview Questions You can have peace of mind knowing that only validated images are utilized in the build and release process if you validate your images before beginning those processes. You will have a greater degree of command over your containerized infrastructure as a result of this."
"49. In relation to cloud services, what do you believe to be the most essential factors to take into account? When it comes to cloud services, scalability, adaptability, and cost-eﬀectiveness are three of the most important factors to consider. One of the most important features of a cloud service is the ability to raise or decrease consumption without incurring any additional costs. This is one of the most valuable qualities of a cloud service. This is a significant advantage in comparison to more conventional, on-premise systems, the expansion of which might o"
"50. Who or what are system integrators when it comes to the Cloud? It's possible that the cloud is made up of a lot of diﬀerent and complicated elements. A system integrator in the cloud is required for a variety of cloud-related tasks, including the development of a cloud, the integration of its numerous components, and the establishment of a hybrid or private cloud network. GCP (Google Cloud Platform) Interview Questions"
51. How do the diﬀerent deployment models for so
"52. Before we can implement cloud computing, we need to have a better understanding of why it is necessary to have a virtualization platform. Using virtualization technology, it is possible to generate a variety of diﬀerent things, including operating systems, virtual storage, networks, applications, and so on. Utilizing virtualization will allow for the expansion of the currently installed infrastructure. Many applications and operating systems are compatible with the servers that are now available."
"Deep Learning Interview Questions Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that is entirely based on artificial neural networks. Because neural networks are designed to mimic the human brain, deep learning is likewise a human brain mimic. We don't have to explicitly program everything in deep learning. We train a model on a training dataset and improvise it until the model predicts almost correctly on the testing and validation dataset as well. Deep learning models are capable of focusing on accurate features on their own, with only a little input from the programmer, and are highly useful in resolving the dimensionality problem. Deep learning is not a new concept. It has been around for quite some time. It's all the rage these days since we don't have nearly as much processing power or as much data as we do now. As processing power has increased tremendously over the last 20 years, deep learning and machine learning have entered the scene. While working on a deep learning network in the mid-1960s, Alexey Grigorevich Ivakhnenko published the first general. Essentially, it is a machine learning subset that does feature extraction and transformation using a large number of nonlinear processing units. Each of the subsequent layers uses the output from the previous layer as input. Deep learning is appropriate for a variety of applications, including computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing, and so on. Deep Learning Interview Questions The above image depicts that Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning. Deep Learning Interview Questions for Freshers"
"1. What do you understand about Neural Networks in the context of Deep Learning? Neural Networks are artificial systems that have a lot of resemblance to the biological neural networks in the human body. A neural network is a set of algorithms that attempts to recognize underlying relationships in a batch of data using a method that mimics how the human brain works. Without any task-specific rules, these systems learn to do tasks by being exposed to a variety of datasets and examples. The notion is that instead of being programmed with a pre-coded understanding of these datasets, the system derives identifying traits from the data it is fed to. Neural networks are built on threshold logic computational models. Because neural networks can adapt to changing input, they can produce the best possible outcome without requiring the output criteria to be redesigned."
2. What are the applications of deep learning? Deep Learning Interview Questions Following are some of the applications of deep learning:- Pattern recognition and natural language processing. Recognition and processing of images. Automated translation. Analysis of sentiment. System for answering questions. Classification and Detection of Objects. Handwriting Generation by Machine. Automated text generation. Colorization of Black and White images.
"3. Explain learning rate in the context of neural network models. What happens if the learning rate is too high or too low? Learning rate is a number that ranges from 0 to 1. It is one of the most important tunable hyperparameters in neural network training models. The learning rate determines how quickly or slowly a neural network model adapts to a given situation and learns. A higher learning rate value indicates that the model only needs a few training epochs and produces rapid changes, whereas a lower learning rate indicates that the model may take a long time to converge or may never converge and become stuck on a poor solution. As a result, it is recommended that a good learning rate value be established by trial and error rather than using a learning rate that is too low or too high. Deep Learning Interview Questions In the above image, we can clearly see that a big learning rate leads us to move away from the desired output. However, having a small learning rate leads us to the desired output eventually."
"4. What are the advantages of neural networks? Following are the advantages of neural networks: Neural networks are extremely adaptable, and they may be used for both classification and regression problems, as well as much more complex problems. Neural networks are also quite scalable. We can create as many layers as we wish, each with its own set of neurons. When there are a lot of data points, neural networks have been shown to generate the best outcomes. They are best used with non-linear data such as images, text, and so on. They can be applied to any data that can be transformed into a numerical value. Once the neural network mode has been trained, they deliver output very fast. Thus, they are time-eﬀective."
"5. What are the disadvantages of neural networks? Following are the disadvantages of neural networks:- Deep Learning Interview Questions The ""black box"" aspect of neural networks is a well-known disadvantage. That is, we have no idea how or why our neural network produced a certain result. When we enter a dog image into a neural network and it predicts that it is a duck, we may find it challenging to understand what prompted it to make this prediction. It takes a long time to create a neural network model. Neural networks models are computationally expensive to build because a lot of computations need to be done at each layer. A neural network model requires significantly more data than a traditional machine learning model to train."
"6. Explain what a deep neural network is. An artificial neural network (ANN) having numerous layers between the input and output layers is known as a deep neural network (DNN). Deep neural networks are neural networks that use deep architectures. The term ""deep"" refers to functions that have a higher number of layers and units in a single layer. It is possible to create more accurate models by adding more and larger layers to capture higher levels of patterns. The below image depicts a deep neural network."
"7. What are the diﬀerent types of deep neural networks? Deep Learning Interview Questions Following are the diﬀerent types of deep neural networks:- FeedForward Neural Network:- This is the most basic type of neural network, in which flow control starts at the input layer and moves to the output layer. These networks only have a single layer or a single hidden layer. There is no backpropagation mechanism in this network because data only flows in one way. The input layer of this network receives the sum of the weights present in the input. These networks are utilised in the computer vision-based facial recognition method. Deep Learning Interview Questions Radial Basis Function Neural Network:- This type of neural network usually has more than one layer, preferably two. The relative distance from any location to the center is determined in this type of network and passed on to the next layer. In order to avoid blackouts, radial basis networks are commonly employed in power restoration systems to restore power in the shortest period possible. Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP):- A multilayer perceptron (MLP) is a type of feedforward artificial neural network (ANN). MLPs are the simplest deep neural networks, consisting of a succession of completely linked layers. Each successive layer is made up of a collection of nonlinear functions that are the weighted sum of all the previous layer's outputs (completely linked). Speech recognition and other machine learning systems rely heavily on these networks. Deep Learning Interview Questions Convolutional Neural Network (CNN):- Convolutional Neural Networks are mostly used in computer vision. In contrast to fully linked layers in MLPs, one or more convolution layers extract simple characteristics from input by performing convolution operations in CNN models. Each layer is made up of nonlinear functions of weighted sums at various coordinates of spatially close subsets of the previous layer's outputs, allowing the weights to be reused. The AI system learns to automatically extract the properties of these inputs to fulfill a specific task, such as picture classification, face identification, and image semantic segmentation, given a sequence of images or videos from the actual world. Deep Learning Interview Questions Recurrent Neural Network (RNN):- Recurrent Neural Networks were created to solve the sequential input data time-series problem. RNN's input is made up of the current input and prior samples. As a result, the node connections create a directed graph. Furthermore, each neuron in an RNN has an internal memory that stores the information from previous samples' computations. Because of their superiority in processing data with a variable input length, RNN models are commonly employed in natural language processing (NLP). The goal of AI in this case is to create a system that can understand human-spoken natural languages, such as natural language modeling, word embedding, and machine translation. Each successive layer in an RNN is made up of nonlinear functions of weighted sums of outputs and the preceding state. As a result, the basic unit of RNN is termed ""cell,"" and each cell is made up of layers and a succession of cells that allow recurrent neural network models to be processed sequentially. Modular Neural Network:- This network is made up of numerous tiny neural networks, rather than being a single network. The sub-networks combine to form a larger neural network, which operates independently to achieve a common goal. These networks are extremely useful for breaking down a large- small problem into smaller chunks and then solving it. Deep Learning Interview Questions Sequence to Sequence Model:- In most cases, this network is made up of two RNN networks. The network is based on encoding and decoding, which means it has an encoder that processes the input and a decoder that processes the output. This type of network is commonly employed for text processing when the length of the inputting text diﬀers from the length of the outputted text."
"8. What do you mean by end-to-end learning? It's a deep learning procedure in which a model is fed raw data and the entire data is trained at the same time to create the desired result with no intermediate steps. It is a deep learning method in which all of the diﬀerent steps are trained simultaneously rather than sequentially. End-to-end learning has the advantage of eliminating the requirement for implicit feature engineering, which usually results in lower bias. Driverless automobiles are an excellent example that you may use in your end-to-end learning content. They are guided by human input and are programmed to learn and interpret information automatically using a CNN to fulfill tasks. Another good example is the generation of a written transcript (output) from a recorded audio clip (input). The model here skips all of the steps in the middle, focusing instead on the fact that it can manage the entire sequence of steps and tasks. Deep Learning Interview Questions"
"9. What do you understand about gradient clipping in the context of deep learning? Gradient Clipping is a technique for dealing with the problem of exploding gradients (a situation in which huge error gradients build up over time, resulting in massive modifications to neural network model weights during training) that happens during backpropagation. The problem of exploding gradients occurs when the gradients get excessively big during training, causing the model to become unstable. If the gradient has crossed the anticipated range, the gradient values are driven element-by- element to a specific minimum or maximum value. Gradient clipping improves numerical stability while training a neural network, but it has little eﬀect on the performance of the model."
"10. Explain Forward and Back Propagation in the context of deep learning. Forward Propagation: The hidden layer, between the input layer and the output layer of the network, receives inputs with weights. We calculate the output of the activation at each node at each hidden layer, and this propagates to the next layer until we reach the final output layer. We go forward from the inputs to the final output layer, which is known as the forward propagation. Back Propagation: It sends error information from the network's last layer to all of the weights within the network. It's a technique for fine-tuning the weights of a neural network based on the previous epoch's (i.e., iteration) error rate. By fine-tuning the weights, you may lower error rates and improve the model's generalization, making it more dependable. The process of backpropagation can be broken down into the following steps: It can generate output by propagating training data through the network. It, then, computes the error derivative for output activations using the target and output values. It can backpropagate to compute the derivative of the error in the previous layer's output activation, and so on for all hidden layers. It calculates the error derivative for weights using the previously obtained derivatives and all hidden layers. The weights are updated based on the error derivatives obtained from the next layer. Deep Learning Interview Questions"
"11. Explain Data Normalisation. What is the need for it? Data Normalisation is a technique in which data is transformed in such a way that they are either dimensionless or have a similar distribution. It is also known as standardization and feature scaling. It's a pre-processing procedure for the input data that removes redundant data from the dataset. Normalization provides each variable equal weights/importance, ensuring that no single variable biases model performance in its favour simply because it is larger. It vastly improves model precision by converting the values of numeric columns in a dataset to a similar scale without distorting the range of values."
"12. What are the diﬀerent techniques to achieve data normalization? Following are the diﬀerent techniques employed to achieve data normalization:- Deep Learning Interview Questions Rescaling: Rescaling data is the process of multiplying each member of a data set by a constant term k, or changing each integer x to f(X), where f(x) = kx and k and x are both real values. The simplest of all approaches, rescaling (also known as ""min-max normalization""), is calculated as: {""detectHand"":false} This represents the rescaling factor for every data point x. Mean Normalisation: In the transformation process, this approach employs the mean of the observations: {""detectHand"":false} This represents the mean normalizing factor for every data point x. Deep Learning Interview Questions Z-score Normalisation: This technique, also known as standardization, employs the Z-score or ""standard score."" SVM and logistic regression are two examples of machine learning algorithms that utilise it: {""detectHand"":false} This represents the Z-score."
"13. What do you mean by hyperparameters in the context of deep learning? Deep Learning Interview Questions Hyperparameters are variables that determine the network topology (for example, the number of hidden units) and how the network is trained (Eg: Learning Rate). They are set before training the model, that is, before optimizing the weights and the bias. Following are some of the examples of hyperparameters:- Number of hidden layers: With regularisation techniques, many hidden units inside a layer can boost accuracy. Underfitting may occur if the number of units is reduced. Learning Rate: The learning rate is the rate at which a network's parameters are updated. The learning process is slowed by a low learning rate, but it eventually converges. A faster learning rate accelerates the learning process, but it may not converge. A declining Learning rate is usually desired."
"14. Diﬀerence between multi-class and multi-label classification problems. Deep Learning Interview Questions The classification task in a multi-class classification problem has more than two mutually exclusive classes (classes that have no intersection or no attributes in common), whereas in a multi-label classification problem, each label has a diﬀerent classification task, although the tasks are related in some way. For example, classifying a group of photographs of animals that could be cats, dogs, or bears is a multi-class classification problem that assumes each sample can be of only one type, implying that an image can be categorized as either a cat or a dog, but not both at the same time. Now let us assume you wish to manipulate the image below. Deep Learning Interview Questions The image above must be categorized as both a cat and a dog because it depicts both creatures. A set of labels is allocated to each sample in a multi-label classification issue, and the classes are not mutually exclusive. In a multi-label classification problem, a pattern can belong to one or more classes."
"15. Explain transfer learning in the context of deep learning. Transfer learning is a learning technique that allows data scientists to use what they've learned from a previous machine learning model that was used for a similar task. The ability of humans to transfer their knowledge is used as an example in this learning. You can learn to operate other two-wheeled vehicles more simply if you learn to ride a bicycle. A model trained for autonomous automobile driving can also be used for autonomous truck driving. The features and weights can be used to train the new model, allowing it to be reused. When there is limited data, transfer learning works eﬀectively for quickly training a model. Deep Learning Interview Questions In the above image, the first diagram represents training a model from scratch while the second diagram represents using a model already trained on cats and dogs to classify the diﬀerent class of vehicles, thereby representing transfer learning."
"16. What are the advantages of transfer learning? Following are the advantages of transfer learning : Better initial model: In other methods of learning, you must create a model from scratch. Transfer learning is a better starting point because it allows us to perform tasks at a higher level without having to know the details of the starting model. Higher learning rate: Because the problem has already been taught for a similar task, transfer learning allows for a faster learning rate during training. Higher accuracy a"
"17. Is it possible to train a neural network model by setting all biases to 0? Also, is it possible to train a neural network model by setting all of the weights to 0? Deep Learning Interview Questions Yes, even if all of the biases are set to zero, the neural network model has a chance of learning. No, training a model by setting all of the weights to 0 is impossible since the neural network will never learn to complete a task. When all weights are set to zero, the derivatives for each w remain constant, resulting in neurons learning the same features in each iteration. Any constant initialization of weights, not simply zero, is likely to generate a poor result."
"18. What is a tensor in deep learning? A tensor is a multidimensional array that represents a generalization of vectors and matrices. It is one of the key data structures used in deep learning. Tensors are represented as n-dimensional arrays of base data types. The data type of each element in the Tensor is the same, and the data type is always known. It's possible that only a portion of the shape (that is, the number of dimensions and the size of each dimension) is known. Most operations yield fully-known tensors if their inputs are likewise fully known, however, in other circumstances, the shape of a tensor can only be determined at graph execution time. Deep Learning Interview Questions"
"19. Explain the diﬀerence between a shallow network and a deep network. A hidden layer, as well as input and output layers, are present in every neural network. Shallow neural networks are those that have only one hidden layer, whereas deep neural networks include numerous hidden layers. Both shallow and deep networks can fit into any function, however, shallow networks require a large number of input parameters, whereas deep networks, because of their several layers, can fit functions with a small number of input parameters. Deep networks are currently favored over shallow networks because the model learns a new and abstract representation of the input at each layer. In comparison to shallow networks, they are also far more eﬀicient in terms of the number of parameters and computations."
"20. In a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), how can you fix the constant validation accuracy? Deep Learning Interview Questions When training any neural network, constant validation accuracy is a common issue because the network just remembers the sample, resulting in an over-fitting problem. Over-fitting a model indicates that the neural network model performs admirably on the training sample, but the model's performance deteriorates on the validation set. Following are some ways for improving CNN's constant validation accuracy: It is always a good idea to split the dataset into three sections: training, validation, and testing. When working with limited data, this diﬀiculty can be handled by experimenting with the neural network's parameters. By increasing the training dataset's size. By using batch normalization. By implementing regularization By reducing the complexity of the network"
"21. Explain Batch Gradient Descent. Batch Gradient Descent: Batch Gradient Descent entails computation (involved in each step of gradient descent) over the entire training set at each step and hence it is highly slow on very big training sets. As a result, Batch Gradient Descent becomes extremely computationally expensive. This is ideal for error manifolds that are convex or somewhat smooth. Batch Gradient Descent also scales nicely as the number of features grows. Deep Learning Interview Questions"
"22. Explain Stochastic Gradient Descent. How is it diﬀerent from Batch Gradient Descent? Stochastic Gradient Descent: Stochastic Gradient Descent seeks to tackle the major diﬀiculty with Batch Gradient Descent, which is the use of the entire training set to calculate gradients at each step. It is stochastic in nature, which means it chooses up a ""random"" instance of training data at each step and then computes the gradient, which is significantly faster than Batch Gradient Descent because there are much fewer data to modify at once. Stochastic Gradient Descent is best suited for unconstrained optimization problems. The stochastic nature of SGD has a drawback in that once it gets close to the minimum value, it doesn't settle down and instead bounces around, giving us a good but not optimal value for model parameters. This can be solved by lowering the learning rate at each step, which will reduce the bouncing and allow SGD to settle down at the global minimum a"
"23. Which deep learning algorithm is the best for face detection? Face identification may be accomplished using a variety of machine learning methods, but the best ones use Convolutional Neural Networks and deep learning. The following are some notable face detection algorithms: FaceNet, Probablisit, Face Embedding, ArcFace, Cosface, and Spherface."
"24. What is an activation function? What is the use of an activation function? An artificial neural network's activation function is a function that is introduced to help the network learn complex patterns in the data. When compared to a neuron- based model seen in our brains, the activation function is responsible for determining what is to be fired to the next neuron at the end of the process. In an ANN, an activation function performs the same job. It takes the preceding cell's output signal and turns it into a format that may be used as input to the next cell. Deep Learning Interview Questions Here, x0 and x1 are the inputs. w1 is the weight and a is the activation function. The activation function introduces non-linearity into the neural network, allowing it to learn more complex functions. The neural network would only be able to learn a function that is a linear combination of its input data if it didn't have the Activation function. The activation function converts inputs to outputs. The activation function is in charge of determining whether or not a neuron should be stimulated. It arrives at a decision by calculating the weighted total and then adds bias. The activation function's main goal is to introduce non-linearity into a neuron's output."
"25. What do you mean by an epochs in the context of deep learning? An epoch is a terminology used in deep learning that refers to the number of passes the deep learning algorithm has made across the full training dataset. Batches are commonly used to group data sets (especially when the amount of data is very large). The term ""iteration"" refers to the process of running one batch through the model. The number of epochs equals the number of iterations if the batch size is the entire training dataset. This is frequently not the case for practical reasons. Several epochs are used in the creation of many models. Deep Learning Interview Questions There is a general relation which is given by:- d * e = i * b where, d is the dataset size e is the number of epochs i is the number of iterations b is the batch size Deep Learning Interview Questions for Experienced"
"26. While building a neural network architecture, how will you decide how many neurons and the hidden layers should the neural network have? There is no clear and fast rule for determining the exact number of neurons and hidden layers required to design a neural network architecture given a business problem. The size of the hidden layer in a neural network should be somewhere between the size of the output layers and that of the input layers. However, there are a few basic ways that might help you get a head start on constructing a neural network architecture: The best method to approach any unique real-world predictive modelling problem is to start with some basic systematic experimentation to see what would perform best for any given dataset based on previous experience working with neural networks in similar real-world situations. The network configuration can be chosen based on one's understanding of the problem domain and previous expertise with neural networks. The number of layers and neurons employed on similar issues is always a good place to start when evaluating a neural network's configuration. It is best to start with simple neural network architecture and gradually increase the complexity of the neural network based on predicted output and accuracy. Deep Learning Interview Questions"
"27. Can a deep learning model be solely built on linear regression? Yes, if the problem is represented by a linear equation, deep networks can be built using a linear function as the activation function for each layer. A problem that is a composition of linear functions, on the other hand, is a linear function, and there is nothing spectacular that can be accomplished by implementing a deep network because adding more nodes to the network will not boost the machine learning model's predictive capacity."
"28. According to you, which one is more powerful - a two layer neural network without any activation function or a two layer decision tree? A two-layer neural network is made up of three layers: one input layer, one hidden layer, and one output layer. When dealing with neural networks, an activation function is essential since it is required when dealing with complex and nonlinear functional mappings between inputs and response variables. When there is no activation function in a two-layer neural network, it is simply a linear network. A Neural Network without an Activation function is just a Linear Regression Model, which has limited capability and frequently fails to perform well. A decision tree with a depth of two layers is known as a two-layer decision tree. Decision Trees are a type of supervised machine learning (that is, the machine is fed with what the input is and what the related output is in the training data) in which the data is continually split according to a parameter. Two entities, decision nodes, and leaves can be used to explain the tree. The decisions or final outcomes are represented by the leaves. And the data is separated at the decision nodes. When comparing these two models, the two-layer neural network (without activation function) is more powerful than the two-layer decision tree, because the two-layer neural network will consider more attributes while building a model, whereas the two-layer decision tree will only consider 2 or 3 attributes.

"29. Diﬀerentiate between bias and variance in the context of deep learning models. How can you achieve balance between the two? Comprehending prediction errors is crucial when it comes to understanding predictions. Reducible (errors that arise due to squared bias or squared variance) and irreducible (errors that arise due to the randomness or natural variability in a system and cannot be reduced by varying the model) mistakes are the two primary types of errors. There are two types of reducible errors: bias and variance. Gaining a thorough grasp of these flaws aids in the construction of an accurate model by preventing overfitting and underfitting. Bias: The bias is defined as the diﬀerence between the ML model's predicted values and the actual value. Biasing results in a substantial inaccuracy in both training and testing data. To avoid the problem of underfitting, it is advised that an algorithm be low biassed at all times. Deep Learning Interview Questions The data predicted is in a straight line format due to significant bias, and hence does not fit accurately in the data set. Underfitting of data is the term for this type of fitting. This occurs when the theory is too straightforward or linear. Consider the graph below as an illustration of a situation like this. Variance: The variance of the model is the variability of model prediction for a given data point, which tells us about the dispersion of our data. It is the diﬀerence between the validation error and the training error. The model with high variance has a very complex fit to the training data and so is unable to fit accurately on new data. As a result, while such models perform well on training data, they have high error rates when testing data. When a model's variance is excessive, it's referred to as Overfitting of Data. Overfitting, which involves accurately fitting the training set using a complicated curve and a high order hypothesis, is not a viable option because the error with unknown data is considerable. Variance should be kept to a minimum when training a data model. Deep Learning Interview Questions The model must always aim for a low bias and a low variance in order to achieve the best balance between the two mistakes."
"30. How does Recurrent Neural Network backpropagation vary from Artificial Neural Network backpropagation? Backpropagation in Recurrent Neural Networks diﬀer from that of Artificial Neural Networks in the sense that each node in Recurrent Neural Networks has an additional loop as shown in the following image: Deep Learning Interview Questions This loop, in essence, incorporates a temporal component into the network. This allows for the capture of sequential information from data, which is impossible with a generic artificial neural network."
"31. What exactly do you mean by exploding and vanishing gradients? By taking incremental steps towards the minimal value, the gradient descent algorithm aims to minimize the error. The weights and biases in a neural network are updated using these processes. However, at times, the steps grow excessively large, resulting in increased updates to weights and bias terms — t o the point where the weights overflow (or become NaN, that is, Not a Number). An exploding gradient is the result of this, and it is an unstable method. On the other hand, if the steps are excessively small, it results in minor – even negligible – changes in the weights and bias terms. As a result, we may end up training a deep learning model with nearly identical weights and biases every time, never reaching the least error function. The vanishing gradient is what it's called."
"32. What are autoencoders? Explain the diﬀerent layers of autoencoders. An autoencoder is a type of neural network with the condition that the output layer has the same dimension as that of the input layer. In other words, the number of output units in the output layer is equal to the number of input units in the input layer. An autoencoder is also known as a replicator neural network since it duplicates data from the input to the output in an unsupervised way. Deep Learning Interview Questions By sending the input through the network, the autoencoders rebuild each dimension of the input. It may appear simple to use a neural network to replicate an input, however, the size of the input is reduced during the replication process, resulting in a smaller representation. In comparison to the input and output layers, the middle layers of the neural network have fewer units. As a result, the reduced representation of the input is stored in the middle layers. This reduced representation of the input is used to recreate the output. Following are the diﬀerent layers in the architecture of autoencoders : Encoder: An encoder is a fully connected, feedforward neural network that compresses the input image into a latent space representation and encodes it as a compressed representation in a lower dimension. The deformed representation of the original image is the compressed image. Code: The reduced representation of the input that is supplied into the decoder is stored in this section of the network. Decoder: Like the encoder, the decoder is a feedforward network with a structure identical to the encoder. This network is in charge of reassembling the input from the code to its original dimensions. Deep Learning Interview Questions As we can see in the above image, the input is compressed in the encoder, then stored in the Code, and then the original input is decompressed from the code by the decoder. The autoencoder's principal goal is to provide an output that is identical to the input."
"33. Mention the applications of autoencoders. Following are the applications of autoencoders:- Deep Learning Interview Questions Image Denoising: Denoising images is a skill that autoencoders excel at. A noisy image is one that has been corrupted or has a little amount of noise (that is, random variation of brightness or color information in images) in it. Image denoising is used to gain accurate information about the image's content. Dimensionality Reduction: The input is converted into a reduced representation by the autoencoders, which is stored in the middle layer called code. This is where the information from the input has been compressed, and each node may now be treated as a variable by extracting this layer from the model. As a result, we can deduce that by removing the decoder, an autoencoder can be utilised for dimensionality reduction, with the coding layer as the output. Feature Extraction: The encoding section of Autoencoders aids in the learning of crucial hidden features present in the input data, lowering the reconstruction error. During encoding, a new collection of original feature combinations is created. Image Colorization: Converting a black-and-white image to a coloured one is one of the applications of autoencoders. We can also convert a colourful image to grayscale. Data Compression: Autoencoders can be used for data compression. Yet they are rarely used for data compression because of the following reasons: Lossy compression: The autoencoder's output is not identical to the input, but it is a near but degraded representation. They are not the best option for lossless compression. Data-specific: Autoencoders can only compress data that is identical to the data on which they were trained. They diﬀer from traditional data compression algorithms like jpeg or gzip in that they learn features relevant to the provided training data. As a result, we can't anticipate a landscape photo to be compressed by an autoencoder trained on handwritten digits."
"34. What do you know about Dropout? Deep Learning Interview Questions Dropout is a regularization approach that helps to avoid overfitting and hence improves generalizability (that is, the model predicts correct output for most of the inputs in general, rather than only being limited to the training data set). In general, we should utilize a low dropout value of 20 percent to 50 percent of neurons, with 20% being a decent starting point. A probability that is too low has no eﬀect, whereas a number that is too high causes the network to under-learn. When you employ dropout on a larger network, you're more likely to achieve better results because the model has more opportunities to learn independent representations."
"35. Diﬀerentiate between Deep Learning and Machine Learning. Deep Learning Interview Questions Deep Learning: Deep Learning is a subclass of Machine Learning in which a recurrent neural network and an artificial neural network are linked. The algorithms are constructed in the same way as machine learning algorithms are, however, there are many more levels of algorithms. The artificial neural network refers to all of the algorithm's networks put together. In much simpler terms, it mimics the human brain by connecting all of the neural networks in the brain, which is the concept of deep learning. It uses algorithms and a technique to tackle all types of complex problems. Machine Learning: Machine learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that allows a system to learn and grow from its experiences without having to be programmed to that level. Data is used by Machine Learning to learn and get accurate outcomes. Machine learning algorithms have the ability to learn and improve their performance by gaining more data. Machine learning is currently employed in self-driving cars, cyber fraud detection, face recognition, and Facebook friend suggestion, among other applications. Learn More. The following table illustrates the diﬀerence between them: Deep Learning Interview Questions Deep Learning Machine Learning Deep Learning is a subclass of Machine Learning.Machine Learning is a super- class of Deep Learning. Deep Learning employs neural networks to represent data, which is a very distinct data representation (ANN).Machine Learning represents data in a diﬀerent way than Deep Learning since it uses structured data. In this, the output ranges from numerical values to free-form elements such as text or sound.In this, the output consists of numerical values It uses a neural network to evaluate data features and relationships by passing data through processing layers.It uses a variety of automated techniques to convert input into model functions and forecast future actions. It usually deals with millions of data points. It usually deals with thousands of data points. Machine Learning has evolved into Deep Learning. Essentially, it refers to the depth of machine learning.Artificial Intelligence has evolved into Machine Learning."

Though automated tests help avoid regression issues or find problems that you are already aware of, manual exploratory testing is essential to find the bugs you don’t know about, such as incorrect requirements or implementations. Automation Testing Interview Questions Some types of testing, such as exploratory testing, usability, and accessibility testing, need to be performed by a human tester. Automated testing is only as good as automated tests. If bugs or problems are in the tests themselves, they will provide wrong results, giving false assurance to the stakeholders. Good automation testing tests repeatable test cases which you can reproduce deterministically. It certainly reduces the amount of manual testing that a human tester would perform but does not eliminate it. Once a human tester discovers a bug, they can add automation tests to ensure that it’s caught automatically in the future."

Selenium Interview Questions XPath, also defined as XML-Path (Extensible Markup Language Path), is a language used to query XML documents and provide functionalities like locating elements in Selenium by iterating through each element in a webpage. In XPath, data is stored in a key-value pair format similar to an HTML tag. It uses a single slash, i.e. ‘ / ’ for creating an absolute path, and a double slash, i.e. ‘ // ’ for creating a relative path for an element to be located on a webpage."
"12. In Xpath, what is the diﬀerence between ""/"" and ""//""? Single Slash ""/"" - A single slash is used to create an Xpath with an absolute path, i.e., the XPath will begin with the document node/start node. For example, Absolute XPath: /html/body/div/div/form/input Here, /html is the root html node. Double Slash ""//"" - The double slash is used to construct an Xpath with a relative path, which means the XPath can start selection from anywhere on the page. For example, Relative XPath: //input[@id = 'email'] Here, we can locate an input having id = ‘email’ present anywhere in the document object model (DOM)."

"16. What is Selenium WebDriver? Selenium WebDriver, also known as Selenium 2, is a browser automation framework that accepts and sends commands to a browser to implement it. It has direct control over the browser because it communicates with it directly. Java, C#, PHP, Python, Perl, and Ruby are all supported by Selenium WebDriver."
17. Is Selenium WebDriver a library? Selenium WebDriver is a prominent free open-source library for automating browsers and testing web applications.
"18. Is Selenium WebDriver an interface or a class? Selenium WebDriver is usually a set of methods defined by an interface. The browser- specific classes, on the other hand, provide an implementation of it by extending a class. AndroidDriver, ChromeDriver, FirefoxDriver, InternetExplorerDriver, SafariDriver, and others are some of the implementation classes."
"19. What are the diﬀerent types of WebDriver Application Programming Interfaces in Selenium? The Various Types of WebDriver APIs in Selenium are as follows: Opera Driver InternetExplorer Driver Chrome Driver Safari Driver Android Driver Firefox Driver Gecko Driver iPhone Driver EventFiringWebDriver HTMLUnit Driver. new WebDriverWait(firefoxDriver, pageLoadTimeout).until( webDriver -> ((JavascriptExecutor) webDriver).executeScript(""return document.ready Selenium Interview Questions"

"21. What open-source frameworks does Selenium WebDriver support? The following are the open-source frameworks supported by the Selenium WebDriver: TestNG: Cédric Beust designed TestNG, a testing framework for the Java programming language that was influenced by JUnit and NUnit. TestNG was created with the purpose of covering a wider range of test categories, including unit, functional, end-to-end, integration, and so on, with more robust and user-friendly functions. JUnit: It is used for Unit Testing of various types of applications."
22. What is WebDriver's super interface? SearchContext is the Super Interface of the WebDriver.
"23. Explain the following line of code. Webdriver driver = new FirefoxDriver(); Selenium Interview Questions 'WebDriver' is an interface, and we are generating a WebDriver object by instantiating a FirefoxDriver object (This object uses Firefox Driver to link the test cases with the Firefox browser)."
24. Is it necessary to use Selenium Server to run Selenium WebDriver scripts? Selenium Server is required when distributing Selenium WebDriver scripts for execution with Selenium Grid. Selenium Grid is a Selenium functionality that allows you to execute test cases on multiple machines on various platforms. You wish to execute your test cases on a remote machine because your local machine is running numerous applications. You will need to set up the remote server so that the test cases can run on it.
"25. What will happen if I execute this command? driver.get(“www.interviewbit.com”) ; An exception is triggered if the URL does not begin with http or https. As a result, the HTTP protocol must be sent to the driver.get() method."
26. What is an alternative option to driver.get() method to open an URL in Selenium Web Driver? driver.navigate() can be used instead. It is used for navigating forwards and backwards in a browser.
27. What is the diﬀerence between driver.get() and driver.navigate.to(“url”)? The diﬀerence between the two is as follows: driver.get(): To open a URL and have it wait for the entire page to load. driver.navigate.to(): To navigate to a URL without having to wait for the entire page to load.
"28. In Selenium WebDriver, what is the diﬀerence between driver.getWindowHandle() and driver.getWindowHandles()? Selenium Interview Questions The diﬀerence between the two is as follows: driver.getWindowHandle() – This method returns the current page's handle (a unique identifier). driver.getWindowHandles() – This function returns a list of handles for all of the pages that are opened at that particular time."
"29. What are the diﬀerences between the methods driver.close() and driver.quit()? The functions of these two methods (driver.close and driver.quit) are nearly identical. Although both allow us to close a browser, there is a distinction. To close the current WebDriver instance, use driver.close(). To close all open WebDriver instances, use driver.quit()."
"30. What is the diﬀerence between driver.findElement() and driver.findElements() commands? The distinction between driver.findElement() and driver.findElements() commands is- findElement() - Based on the locator supplied as an argument, findElement() returns a single WebElement which is found first. If no element is discovered, it throws the NoSuchElementException. findElement() has the following syntax: WebElement textbox = driver.findElement(By.id(""textBoxLocator"")); findElements() - Based on the locator supplied as an argument, findElements(), on the other hand, produces a list of WebElements that all satisfy the location value supplied. If no element is discovered, it does not throw any exception and returns a list of zero elements. findElements() has the following syntax: Selenium Interview Questions List <WebElement> elements = element.findElements(By.id(""value""));"
"31. What are some cases that Selenium WebDriver cannot automate? Some of the scenarios which we cannot automate are as follows: Selenium WebDriver does not support bitmap comparison. Using Selenium WebDriver to automate Captcha is not possible. Using Selenium WebDriver, we are unable to read bar codes. Video streaming scenarios: Selenium will almost never be able to recognise video controllers. To some extent, JavaScript Executor and flex UI selenium will work, although they are not completely dependable. Performance testing can be automated, however, it's preferable to avoid using Selenium for performance testing."
"32. In Selenium WebDriver, what is an Object Repository? Instead of hard-coding element locator data in the scripts, the Object Repository is used to store the element locator data in a centralized location. To store all of the element locators, we create a property file (.properties), which acts as an object repository in Selenium WebDriver. Selenium Interview Questions for Experienced"
"33. Explain the diﬀerence between driver.close() and driver.quit() command in Selenium? Following is the major diﬀerence between both the commands: driver.close() command closes the currently active window on which the user is working or the window being currently accessed by the web driver. driver.quit() command, unlike the driver.close() command, closes all the windows opened by the program and hence should be used with care. Both the commands don’t take any parameter and don’t return any value either. Selenium Interview Questions"
"34. Explain the various navigation commands supported by Selenium? Selenium has the support of majorly 4 navigation commands: navigate().back(): This command is used for taking the user to the last webpage of the browser history. navigate().forward(): This command is used for taking the user to the next web page of the browser history. navigate().refresh(): This command is used for reloading the web components of a webpage by refreshing it. navigate().to(): This command is used for navigating to a particular URL in a new web browser. It takes the URL to be migrated to, as a parameter."
"35. Explain the same-origin policy and how Selenium handles it? The same Origin policy is a feature adopted for security purposes that allows a web browser to run scripts from one webpage to access the contents of another webpage provided both pages have the same origin. The URL scheme, hostname, and port number combo are referred to as the origin. This policy was introduced to prevent access to sensitive data on one webpage by another for ill purposes. Consider a Java program used by scaler.com, the program can access domain pages like scaler.com/mentors, scaler.com/courses but none from diﬀerent domains like facebook.com. Selenium Interview Questions The Selenium Server (Selenium RC) acts as a client-configured HTTP proxy and ""tricks"" the browser into believing that Selenium Core and the web application being tested come from the same origin."
36. Explain the pause feature in Selenium IDE. The pause feature is built to handle exceptions in the test script by allowing the user to pause at the statement causing the exception and enter the debug mode by clicking on the pause icon on the top right corner of the IDE. This feature prevents the entire test case's failure and gives the user a chance to correct the error instantly. Selenium Interview Questions

"38. Can we handle a windows-based pop-up in Selenium, and if not, then what are the alternatives? Selenium Interview Questions No, Selenium doesn’t support windows-based pop-ups as it’s an automated testing tool built for web application-based testing. However, with the support of third-party tools like AutoIT, Robot class, etc., windows-based pop-ups can be handled in selenium."
"39. Can you capture a screenshot using Selenium? If yes, write a simple code to illustrate the same. Yes, using a web driver in Selenium, we can capture the screenshot. Following is the code to do the same: import org.junit.After; import org.junit.Before; import org.junit.Test; import java.io.File; import java.io.IOException; import org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils; import org.openqa.selenium.OutputType; import org.openqa.selenium.TakesScreenshot; import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver; import org.openqa.selenium.firefox.FirefoxDriver; public class TakeScreenshot { WebDriver drv; @ Before public void setUp() throws Exception { driver = new FirefoxDriver(); drv.get(""https://google.com""); } @ After public void tearDown() throws Exception { drv.quit(); } @ Test public void test() throws IOException { // Capture the screenshot File scrFile = ((TakeScreenshot)drv).getScreenshotAs(OutputType.FILE); // Code for pasting screenshot to a user-specified location FileUtils.copyFile(scrFile, new File(""C:\\\\Screenshot\\\\Scr.jpg"")) } }"
"40. Explain diﬀerent types of framework and connection of Selenium with Robot Framework. Selenium Interview Questions The following are the diﬀerent types of frameworks: Behavior-Driven Development Framework: This type of framework provides a readable and easily understandable format to Business Analysts, Developers, Testers, etc. Data-Driven Testing Framework: This type of framework helps separate test data from the test-script logic by storing test data in some external database in the form of key-value pairs. These keys can be used for accessing as well as populating data into the test scripts. Keyword-Driven Testing Framework: This type of framework is an extension of the data-driven testing framework. In addition to separating test data and the test-script logic, it also separates a part of the test script code by storing it in an external data file. Library Architecture Testing Framework: This type of framework groups common steps into functions under a library and calls these functions as and when required. Module-Based Testing Framework: This type of framework divides each test application into several isolated and logical modules, with each module having its distinct test script. Hybrid Testing Framework: This type of framework is a combination of the above-mentioned frameworks leveraging all their good features. Robot Framework is a modular open-source automation framework that can interact with 3rd party libraries and functions. To execute a web testing library such as Selenium, a test automation runner or an automation wrapper is required, which is provided to it in the form of Robot Framework. Other popular test runners to serve the same purpose are MSTest, TestNG, Nunit, Junit, etc. The below diagram shows the connection of the Robot framework to the Selenium library: Selenium Interview Questions"

Thread.sleep(5000); driver.quit(); } } Selenium Interview Questions Once you run the above script in a Java IDE, you’ll get the following execution logs displayed in your IDE window."
42. Explain basic steps of Selenium testing and its widely used commands via a practical application. Selenium testing can be divided into the following seven basic elements:
1. Creating an instance of a Webdriver: This is the first step for all the usages of a Selenium webdriver API. An instance of a webdriver interface is created using a constructor of a particular browser. This webdriver instance is used to invoke methods and access other interfaces. The following are the most commonly used commands for initializing a web driver: Firefox: WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver(); Chrome: WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver(); Safari Driver: WebDriver driver = new SafariDriver(); Internet Explorer: WebDriver driver = new InternetExplorerDriver(); Selenium Interview Questions
2. Navigating to a webpage: The second step a
"3. Locating an HTML element on the webpage: To interact with a web element and perform actions on it like clicking a button or entering text, we first need to locate the desired elements such as the button or the textbox on the web page. The following are the most commonly used commands for web element navigation: Locating by ID: driver.findElement(By.id(""q"")).sendKeys(""Selenium 3""); Location by Name: driver.findElement(By.name(""q"")).sendKeys (""Selenium 3""); Location by Xpath: driver.findElement(By.xpath(""//input[@id==’q’])).sendKeys(""Selenium 3""); Locating Hyperlinks by Link Text: driver.FindElement(By.LinkText(""edit this page"")).Click(); Locating by ClassName driver.findElement(By.className(""profileheader"")); Locating by TagName driver.findElement(By.tagName(""select')).click(); Locating by LinkText driver.findElement(By.linkText(""NextPage"")).click(); Locating by PartialLinkText driverlindElement(By.partialLinkText("" NextP"")).click();"
"4. Performing actions on an HTML element: Once we have located the HTML element, the next step is interacting with it. The following are the most commonly used commands for performing actions on an HTML elements: Selenium Interview Questions Entering a username usernameElement.sendKeys(""InterviewBit""); Entering a password passwordElement.sendKeys(""Raw""); Submitting a text input element passwordElement.submit(); Submitting a form element: formElement.submit();"
"5. Anticipating browser response from the action: Once an action is performed, anticipating a response from the browser to test comes under this step. It takes a second or two for the action to reach the browser, and hence wait is o"
"6. Running tests and recording their results using a test framework: in this step, we run tests in an automated test script to evaluate an application's function and performance. Various test frameworks are used for this step, such as:"
1. JUnit for Java
2. NUnit for C#
3. Unittest or Pyunit for Python
"4. RUnit for Ruby Most frameworks use some sort of asset statement to verify their test results from the expected results. Eg: WebElement messageElement = wait.until( ExpectedConditions.presenceOfElementLocate Selenium Interview Questions assertEquals (expectedMessage, actualMessage);"
"7. Concluding a test: In this step, we conclude a test by invoking a quit method on the driver variable. This step closes all the webpages, quits the WebDriver server, and releases the driver. Eg: driver.quit(); The following is an example of an app that covers all the steps mentioned above: import org.openqa.selenium.By, import org.openqa.selenium.WebElement, import org.openqa.selenium.support.ni.ExpectedConditiof, import org.openqa.selenium.sup import org.junit.Assert; public class Example { public static void main(String[] args) { // Creating a driver instance WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver(), // Navigate to a web page driver.get(""http://www.foo.com""); // Enter text to submit the form WebElement usernameElement = driver.findElement( By.name(""username"")); WebElement passwordElement = driver.findElement(By.name(”password"")); WebElement formElement = driver.findElement(By.id(”loginForm"")); usernameElement.sendKeys(""Scaler Academy""); passwordElement.sendKeys(""Raw""); formElement.submit(); // submit by form element //Putting an explicit wait WebDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait(driver, 10); WebElement messageElement = wait.until( ExpectedConditions.presenceofElementLocated(By.id(”loginResponse"")) ) ; // Run a test String message = messageElement.getrept(); String successMsg = ""Welcome to foo. You logged in successfully.”; Assert.assertEquals (message, successMsg); // Conclude a test driver.quit(); } } Selenium Interview Questions"
"43. What do you understand about the Page Object Model in the context of Selenium? What are its advantages? Page Object Model (POM) is a design pattern that generates an Object Repository for web UI elements and is widely used in test automation. The paradigm has the advantage of reducing code duplication and improving test maintenance. According to this paradigm, each web page in the application should have its own Page Class. This Page class will identify the web page's WebElements and also has Page methods that operate on those WebElements. The names of these methods should correspond to the tasks they perform, for example, if a loader is waiting for the payment gateway to appear, the POM method name could be waitForPaymentScreenDisplay(). The following are the advantages of the Page Object Model (POM) : According to the Page Object Design Pattern, user interface activities and flows should be separated from verification. Our code is clearer and easier to understand as a result of this notion. The second advantage is that the object repository is independent of test cases, allowing us to reuse the same object repository with diﬀerent tools. For example, we can use Selenium to combine Page Object Model with TestNG/JUnit for functional testing and JBehave/Cucumber for acceptability testing. Because of the reusable page methods in the POM classes, code gets less and more eﬀicient. Methods are given more realistic names that can be easily associated with the UI operation. If we land on the home page a"
"44. What is Jenkins and what are the benefits of using it with Selenium? Selenium Interview Questions Hudson Lab's Jenkins is the most popular open-source continuous integration technology. It's cross-platform, meaning it can run on Windows, Linux, Mac OS, and Solaris. Jenkins is a Java application. Jenkin's main purpose is to keep track of any job, such as SVN (Apache Subversion) checkouts, cron jobs, or application states. When a specific event in an application occurs, it triggers pre-configured actions. Learn More. The following are the features of Jenkins: Selenium Interview Questions Jenkins generates a list of all changes made in SVN repositories, for example. Jenkins gives permanent links to the most recent build or failed build, which can be utilized for convenient communication. Jenkins is simple to install using either a direct installation file (exe) or a war file for deployment via the application server. Jenkins can be set up to send the content of the build status to an email address. Simple Configuration: Jenkins makes it simple to set up multiple tasks. Jenkins can be configured to run the automated test build on TestNg following every SVN build. Jenkins documents the details of the jar, its version, and the mapping of build and jar numbers. Plugins: Jenkins can be set to utilize features and additional functionality provided by third-party plugins. Following are the reasons we use Jenkins with Selenium: When you run Selenium tests in Jenkins, you can run them every time your program changes, and when the tests pass, you may deploy the so"

In such types of questions, the interviewer wants to assess how clear your understanding is of the framework. It is a good practice to explain the code while you write it so that the interviewer is engaged at all points and does not feel le"
"46. What do you understand about broken links? How can you detect broken links in Selenium? Explain properly with code. Links or URLs that are not reachable are known as broken links. They may be unavailable or inoperable due to a server issue. A URL's status will always be 2xx, indicating that it is legitimate. There are a variety of HTTP status codes, each with its own set of functions. HTTP status 4xx and 5xx indicate an invalid request. The 4xx class of status codes is used for client-side errors, while the 5xx class is used for server response errors. Selenium Interview Questions You should always check for broken links on your site to ensure that the user does not end up on an error page. If the rules aren't updated appropriately, or the requested resources aren't available on the server, the error will occur. Manual link checking is a time-consuming task because each web page may have a huge number of links, and the process must be performed for each page. To find broken links in Selenium, follow the instructions below. Using the <a> (anchor) tag, collect all of the links on a web page. For each link, send an HTTP request. Make that the HTTP response code is correct. Based on the HTTP response code, determine whether the link is genuine or not. Repeat the procedure for all of the links that were captured in the first step.

We find all the elements in the web page having the anchor tag with the help of the findElements() method. Then, we iterate over the list obtained one by one and fire up the URL and read the response code received to check if it is a broken link or not."
"47. What do you understand about window handle in the context of automated testing? How can you handle multiple windows in Selenium? The window handle is a one-of-a-kind identifier that contains the addresses of all of the windows. Consider it a window pointer that returns the string value. Each browser will presumably have its own window handle. This window handle function aids in the retrieval of all window handles. Syntax: get.windowhandle(): This function is used to retrieve the current window's handle. get.windowhandles(): This function is useful for retrieving the handles of all the windows that have been opened. set: This method allows you to set the window handles as a string. set<string> set= driver.get.windowhandles() switch to: This method aids in the switching of windows. action: This method aids in the execution of specific window actions. Let us consider an example code to understand better. We will open the website of InterviewBit and then click on all the links available on the web page. Then, we will switch from the parent window to multiple diﬀerent child windows and then switch back to the parent window at last. Selenium Interview Questions In the above code, we open the landing page of interviewbit and then find all the elements having the anchor tag and click them to open multiple child windows. Then, we iterate over each of the child windows and print them as a string. Finally, having traversed over the entire list, we break from the loop and switch back to the parent window. package SeleniumPackage; import java.util.Iterator; import java.util.Set; import org.openqa.selenium.By; import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver; import org.openqa.selenium.chrome.ChromeDriver; public class WindowHandle_Demo { public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception { System.setProperty(""webdriver.chrome.driver"", ""C:\\\\Users\\\\user\\\\Downloads\\\\seleniu WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver(); driver.manage().window().maximize(); // Loading the website driver.get(""http://www.interviewbit.com/""); String parent=driver.getWindowHandle(); // storing the parent window name as a str List<WebElement> links = driver.findElements(By.tagName(""a"")); // storing the list Iterator<WebElement> it = links.iterator(); // Iterating over the list elements one by one and clicking all the links to open while(it.hasNext()){ it.next().click(); } Set<String> s = driver.getWindowHandles(); // Storing the list of all the child wi Iterator<String> I1= s.iterator(); // Iterating over the list of child windows while(I1.hasNext()) { String child_window=I1.next(); if(!parent.equals(child_window)) { driver.switchTo().window(child_window); System.out.println(driver.switchTo().window(child_window).getTitle()); driver.close(); } } //switch to the parent window driver.switchTo().window(parent); } } Selenium Interview Questions Selenium WebDriver Interview Questions"
"48. How to create an Object Repository in your project? There is an Object Repository notion in QTP (Quick Test Professional). By default, when a user records a test, the objects and their properties are saved in an Object Repository. This Object Repository is used by QTP to playback scripts. There is no default Object Repository concept in Selenium. This isn't to say that Selenium doesn't have an Object Repository. Even if there isn't one by default, we could make our own. Objects are referred to as locators in Selenium (such as ID, Name, Class Name, Tag Name, Link Text, Partial Link Text, XPath, and CSS). A collection of objects is referred to as an object repository. Placing all the locators in a separate file is one technique to construct an Object Repository (i.e., properties file). The ideal method, however, is to use Page Object Model. Each web page is represented as a class in the Page Object Model Design Pattern. A class contains all of the items associated with a specific page of a web application."
49. What are the diﬀerent types of waits that WebDriver supports? Selenium Interview Questions
"1. Implicit Wait: Implicit wait instructs Selenium to wait a specified amount of time before throwing a ""No such element"" exception (One of the WebDriver Exceptions is NoSuchElementException, which occurs when the locators indicated in the Selenium Program code is unable to locate the web element on the web page). Before throwing an exception, the Selenium WebDriver is told to wait for a particular amount of time. WebDriver will wait for the element a"
"2. Explicit Wait: Explicit wait tells the WebDriver to wait for specific conditions before throwing an ""ElementNotVisibleException"" exception. The Explicit Wait command tells the WebDriver to wait until a certain condition occurs before continuing to execute the code. Setting Explicit Wait is crucial in circumstances when certain items take longer to load than others. If an implicit wait command is specified, the browser will wait the same amount of time before loading each web element. This adds to the time it takes to run the test script. Explicit waiting is smarter, but it can only be used for specific parts. It is, nonetheless preferable to implicit wait since it allows the programme to stop for dynamically loaded Ajax items. Its Syntax is as follows: WebDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait(WebDriver Reference, TimeOut);"
3. Fluent Wait: It is used to inform the WebDriver how long to wait for a condition and how o
50. Mention the several types of navigation commands that can be used? The several types of navigation commands that can be used are as follows: navigate().to() - It is used for going to the specified URL. driver.navigate().refresh() - The current page is refreshed using the driver.navigate().refresh() command. driver.navigate().forward() - This command does the same function as clicking the browser's Forward Button. Nothing is accepted or returned by it. driver.navigate()back() - This command does the same function as clicking the browser's Back Button. Nothing is accepted or returned by it.
"51. How does a Selenium WebDriver interact with the browser? Wait wait = new FluentWait(WebDriver reference).withTimeout(timeout, SECONDS).pollingEv Selenium Interview Questions On a high level, the Selenium webdriver communicates with the browser and does not transform commands into JavaScript. Our Java or Python code will be transmitted as an API get and post request in the JSON wire protocol. The browser webdriver interacts with the real browser as an HTTP Request, as mentioned in the previous answer. To receive HTTP requests, each Browser Driver utilizes an HTTP server. When the URL reaches the Browser Driver, it will send the request via HTTP to the real browser. The commands in your Selenium script will be executed on the browser a"
"52. What are Selenium WebDriver Listeners? Selenium Interview Questions Selenium WebDriver Listeners, as the name implies, ""listen"" to any event that the Selenium code specifies. Listeners are useful when you want to know what happens before you click any element, before and a"
53. What is the implementation of WebDriver Listeners? The Webdriver Event Listeners can be implemented in one of two ways: WebDriverEventListener is an interface with several built-in methods for tracking Webdriver events. It necessitates the implementation of ALL of the methods described in the Interface. The AbstractWebDriverEventListener class gives us the ability to implement only the methods that we're interested in.
"54. In Selenium WebDriver, how do you handle Ajax calls? When using Selenium WebDriver, one of the most prevalent challenges is handling AJAX calls. We would have no way of knowing when the AJAX call would complete, and the page would be refreshed. In this tutorial, we'll look at how to use Selenium to handle AJAX calls. AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) is an acronym for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. AJAX allows a web page to obtain little quantities of data from the server without having to completely reload the page. Without reloading the page, AJAX sends HTTP requests from the client to the server and then processes the server's answer. Wait commands may not work with AJAX controls. It's only that the page itself is not going to refresh. Selenium Interview Questions The essential information may show on the web page without refreshing the browser when you click on a submit button. It may load in a fraction of a second, or it may take longer. We have no control over how long it takes for pages to load. In Selenium, the easiest way to deal with circumstances like this is to employ dynamic waits (i.e., WebDriverWait in combination with ExpectedCondition) The following are some of the approaches that are available:"
"1. titleIs() – The anticipated condition looks for a specific title on a page. wait.until(ExpectedConditions.titleIs(""Big Sale of the Year""));"
"2. elementToBeClickable() – The desired condition requires that an element be clickable, which means that it must be present/displayed/visible on the screen and enabled. wait.until(ExpectedConditions.elementToBeClickable(By.xpath(""xpath"")));"
3. alertIsPresent() – The expected condition anticipates the appearance of an alert box. wait.until(ExpectedConditions.alertIsPresent())!=null);
4. textToBePresentInElement() – The anticipated condition looks for a string pattern in an element.
"55. Which implementation of WebDriver promises to be the fastest? wait.until(ExpectedConditions.textToBePresentInElement(By.id(""text""),""text to be found"" Selenium Interview Questions HTMLUnitDriver is the quickest WebDriver implementation because the HTMLUnitDriver does not run tests in the browser, this is the case. When compared to running the scripts without a browser, starting a browser and performing test cases took longer. For test case execution, HTMLUnitDriver used a simple HTTP request- response method."
"56. At a bare minimum, how many parameters do selenium commands have? The following four parameters need to be passed in Selenium:"
"1. Host: This is the parameter that binds Selenium to a particular IP address. Because we usually perform Selenium tests on our local system, the value will be 'localhost.' Instead of localhost, you can specify an IP address. The Syntax is as follows: java -jar <selenium server standalone jar name> -host <Your IP Address>"
2. Port number: TCP/IP port for connecting Selenium tests to the Selenium Grid Hub. 4444 is the default port hub. The Syntax is as follows: java -jar <selenium server standalone jar name> -role hub -port 4444 Assure this port isn't being used by any other so
3. Browser: For the execution of the selenium scripts I required a browser to be passed. Selenium Interview Questions
4. Url: The URL of the application needs to be passed.
"57. As seen below, we establish a WebDriver reference variable called 'driver.' What exactly is the purpose of proceeding in this manner? WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver(); instead of creating FirefoxDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver(); We may use the same driver variable to work with any browser we want, such as IEDriver, SafariDriver, and so on if we construct a reference variable of type WebDriver."
"58. What kinds of Selenium WebDriver exceptions have you run into? In the following project the exceptions we've run into are as follows: Element Not Visible Exception: This error is produced when you try to discover a certain element on a webpage that is not currently accessible, despite the fact that it exists in the DOM. Also, if you're trying to find an element with an XPath that connects two or more elements, it can be diﬀicult. Stale Element Reference Exception: This is thrown in one of two scenarios, the first of which is more prevalent: The element has been completely removed. The element has been detached from the DOM. On the elements, with which we are interacting, destruction and then restoration, we get a stale element reference exception. When this happens, the element's DOM reference becomes invalid. Because of this, we are unable to obtain the element's reference. Selenium Interview Questions The following are some more common exceptions: WebDriverException TimeoutException NoAlertPresentException NoSuchWindowException IllegalStateException NoSuchElementException."
"59. What is the best way to deal with StaleElementReferenceException? Before we look at how to manage a StaleElementReferenceException using the Page Object Model, let's have a look at how to handle a StaleElementReferenceException. First, let's define Stale Element Reference Exception. Stale refers to something that is old, deteriorated, and no longer fresh. An old or no longer available element is referred to as a stale element. Assume there is a WebElement in WebDriver that is discovered on a web page. The WebElement becomes stale when the DOM changes. The StaleElementReferenceException is thrown when we try to interact with a stale element."
"60. In a Selenium script, what happens if you use both implicit and explicit wait? According to the oﬀicial Selenium manual, mixing Implicit and Explicit Waits is not recommended. Combining the two can result in unpredictable wait times. Only one time in the code is implicit wait specified. Throughout the driver object instance, it will remain the same. Explicit wait is used in the code whenever it is required. At the time of execution, this wait will be called. It's a conditional waiting period. Wherever explicit wait is applied, it will supersede the implicit wait. As a result, Explicit Wait takes precedence over Implicit Wait."
"61. In a Selenium Script, what happens if you use both Thread.Sleep and WebDriver Waits? Selenium Interview Questions The Thread.sleep() method allows you to suspend the execution for a specified amount of time in milliseconds. If we use WebDriver waits in conjunction with the Thread.sleep() method, the webdriver will pause the execution for the provided amount of time in the parameter of the Thread.sleep() function before proceeding to the next wait. If we combine both waits, the test execution time will increase."
"62. In Selenium WebDriver, how do you take a screenshot? During the execution of the test scripts, test cases may fail. We just capture a screenshot and save it in a result repository while manually executing the test cases. Selenium WebDriver can be used to accomplish the same thing. Some of the instances in which we might need to use Selenium WebDriver to capture a screenshot are as follows: Problems with applications Assertion Defect Finding Web Elements on the web page is diﬀicult. Take a break to look for Webelements on the page. TakesScreenshot is a Selenium interface that has a function getScreenShotAs that may be used to take a screenshot of the programme under test. When capturing screenshots with Selenium 3, we may run into a few diﬀiculties. We utilize the aShot() function to get around this."
"63. How do I use Selenium WebDriver to enter text into a text box? Using the method sendKeys() WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver(); driver.get(""https://www.youtube.com""); driver.findElement(By.xpath(""xpath"")).sendKeys(""Interview Bit"");"
"64. How can I type text into the text box without using the sendKeys() function? Selenium Interview Questions We can use the following piece of code to type text into the text box without using the sendKeys() function: // To initialize js object JavascriptExecutor JS = (JavascriptExecutor)webdriver; // To enter username JS.executeScript(""document.getElementById('User').value='InterviewBit.com'""); // To enter password JS.executeScript(""document.getElementById('Pass').value='tester value'"");"
"65. How can I use Selenium WebDriver to clear the text in a text box? The above task can be done using the clear() function as shown below: WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver(); driver.get(""https://www.youtube.com""); driver.findElement(By.xpath(""xpath_of_element1"")).sendKeys(""Interview Bit""); driver.findElement(By.xpath(""xpath_of_element1"")).clear();"
66. What is the best way to acquire the textual matter of a web element? The best way to acquire the textual matter of a web element is by employing the getText() method as shown below: Selenium Interview Questions
"67. How do I retrieve the value of an attribute in Selenium WebDriver? Using the getAttribute(value) method. It returns the value of the parameterized attribute. HTML: Selenium Program: Output: valueSeleniumWebDriver package interviewBit; // package name import org.openqa.selenium.By; import org.testng.annotations.Test; import org.openqa.selenium.chrome.ChromeDriver; import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver; // importing the necessary libraries // Test class public class Test { @Test public void testmethod(){ // sets the property as required System.setProperty(""webdriver.chrome.driver"",""C:\\\\Selenium Environment\\\\Drivers\\\\chrom //Creates a new Chrome Web Driver WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver(); driver.get(""https://www.youtube.com""); String textAvailable=driver.findElement(By.xpath(""//*[@id='gbw']/div/div/div[1]/div[1]/ System.out.println(""Textual Matter which is Present is :"" + textAvailable); } } <input name=""nameSeleniumWebDriver"" value=""valueSeleniumWebDriver"">Interview Bit</input String attributeValue = driver.findElement(By.name(""nameSeleniumWebDriver"")).getAttribu System.out.println(""Available attribute value is :""+attributeValue); Selenium Interview Questions"

"70. In Selenium WebDriver, how do I push the ENTER key on a text box? To utilize Selenium WebDriver to hit the ENTER key, we must use Selenium Enum Keys with the constant ENTER. driver.findElement(By.xpath(""xpath"")).sendKeys(Keys.ENTER);"
"71. How can I use WebDriver to mouse hover over a web element? We can use the Actions class to mouse hover over a web element as shown below in the code snippet: WebElement ele = driver.findElement(By.xpath(""xpath"")); //Create object 'action' of an Actions class Actions action = new Actions(driver); //Mouseover on an element action.moveToElement(ele).perform();"
72. How does Selenium WebDriver handle hidden elements? Selenium Interview Questions
"73. In Selenium WebDriver, how do you use the Recovery Scenario? Within Selenium WebDriver Java tests, by using ""Try Catch Block."" try { driver.get(""www.interviewbit.com""); }catch(Exception e){ System.out.println(e.getMessage()); }"
"74. What is the Selenium WebDriver Architecture? Selenium WebDriver is a web framework for performing cross-browser testing (Cross- browser testing is comparing and assessing your website's behaviour in various browser contexts. It ensures that your website provides the best possible user experience regardless of the browser used to access it). This program is used to test web-based applications to ensure that they work as expected. Selenium WebDriver allows us to write test scripts in the programming language of our choice. As previously stated, it is an improvement to Selenium RC in that it overcomes a few shortcomings. Although Selenium WebDriver is unable to handle window components, this limitation can be bypassed by using tools such as Sikuli, Auto IT, and others. The Selenium WebDriver Architecture consists of: (JavascriptExecutor(driver)).executeScript(""document.getElementsByClassName(ElementLoca Selenium Interview Questions Selenium Client library. JSON wire protocol over HTTP. Browser Drivers. Browsers. Selenium Tricky Interview Questions"
"75. Why is it important to use TestNG when working with Selenium RC? TestNG is a testing framework that provides more powerful and flexible test configuration and execution than JUnit, the default testing framework used with Selenium RC. TestNG allows for the annotation of test methods, support for data- driven testing, and the ability to run tests in parallel, which can lead to faster test execution and better test organization. Additionally, TestNG provides more advanced reporting and logging capabilities than JUnit. Using TestNG with Selenium RC can help improve the eﬀiciency and eﬀectiveness of automating web application testing."
"76. Can Selenium be used to test responsive web design? Yes, Selenium can be used to test responsive web design. Selenium is a web automation tool that allows for the automation of browser interactions, and as such, it can be used to test the responsiveness of a web page by simulating interactions on diﬀerent screen sizes and resolutions. This can include testing how the page layout adjusts to diﬀerent viewport sizes, testing how the page elements are displayed on diﬀerent devices, and testing how the page behaves when a user switches between landscape and portrait orientations. One way to test responsive web design with Selenium is by using the Selenium WebDriver API to set the browser's viewport size and then test the page's layout and functionality. Another way is to use a third-party library such as Selenium- Responsive-Testing which allows you to test how the page behaves on diﬀerent devices and screen sizes. Selenium Interview Questions It is worth noting that Selenium alone is not enough for responsive web design testing, it should be combined with other methods such as manual testing, visual testing, and using responsive design testing tools to get complete coverage."
"77. What API should be used to test databases when using Selenium WebDriver for database testing? Selenium WebDriver is a tool for automating web browsers, it's not designed for database testing. To test databases, you need a database testing tool that can connect to the database and perform various operations like running SQL queries and asserting the results. Some examples of database testing tools are DBUnit, jOOQ, and JDBC. These tools provide an API that can be used to connect to the database, perform operations and assert the results."
"78. What are assertions in Selenium? In the context of Selenium, assertions are used to check if the actual outcome of a test matches the expected outcome. Assertions are used to validate that a certain condition is true and if it's not true, the test execution will be stopped and an assertion error will be thrown. Assertions can be used to verify that a specific element is present on the page, to check the text of an element, to check the value of an input field, and many other things. Selenium WebDriver provides assertion methods through the org.junit.Assert and org.testng.Assert classes for JUnit and TestNG respectively."
"79. What is the Silk Test Tool? Silk Testing (formerly known as Segue Silk Test) is a commercial, functional, and regression testing tool used for automating the testing of so"
"80. What is the purpose of the testing.xml file ? The testing.xml file, also known as testng.xml is an XML configuration file used in the TestNG framework. It is used to configure and execute test suites and test cases. It provides a way to define and organize test methods, classes, and packages into test suites. It also allows setting up test execution order, parallel execution, test data, test listeners, test reporting, and more. With the testing.xml file, users can specify which test methods or classes should be included or excluded in a test run, what test listeners should be used, and what test configuration should be used, among other things. It is used to organize and execute test methods, classes, and packages in a logical and organized way."
"81. What are the areas where Selenium can improve its features? Selenium has a wide range of capabilities, but some areas where it could see the benefit in extending its features include: Selenium Interview Questions Mobile testing: Selenium has limited support for mobile testing. It can automate web applications on mobile browsers, but it does not support automating native mobile applications. Visual testing: Selenium is mainly used for functional testing, but it does not have built-in support for visual testing. Visual testing compares the look and feel of the application to a pre-approved design and helps in identifying issues related to layout, alignment, and font. Cross-browser testing: Selenium supports a wide range of browsers, but there are still some browsers that are not fully supported or have limited support. Test reports and analysis: Selenium's test reporting capabilities are basic and it does not provide advanced test analytics features like test coverage, flaky test detection, and root cause analysis. Performance testing: Selenium is mainly used for functional testing, but it does not have built-in support for performance testing. Performance testing can help to measure the responsiveness, stability, and scalability of the application under test. Continuous Integration: Selenium does not provide out-of-the-box support for continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) pipeline, it needs to be integrated with other tools to automate the test execution in CI/CD pipeline. It's worth noting that Selenium is widely used and has a large community of developers who are constantly working to improve and extend its capabilities. There are also many other test automation tools that can be used in combination with Selenium to address these limitations."
"82. Can you explain what Page Factory is? Selenium Interview Questions Page Factory is a design pattern used to create an object repository for web elements in Selenium WebDriver. It's an extension of the Page Object Model design pattern, which is used to create a centralized repository for web elements. It uses annotations to identify and initialize web elements at runtime and make the code more readable and maintainable by separating the test code from the technical details of locating web elements. In order to use Page Factory, you need to create a class for each web page and define web elements in that class using the @FindBy annotation it also contains methods for interacting with the web elements."
"83. What is the Actions class? The Actions class is a part of the Selenium Python bindings for automating web browsers. It allows you to perform actions on web elements, such as moving the mouse over an element, clicking on it, and sending keys to it. The Actions class is typically used in conjunction with the WebDriver class, which is the main class for interacting with a web browser."
"84. What are the steps for troubleshooting tests using Selenium IDE? Troubleshooting tests using Selenium IDE can be a multi-step process, but here are some general steps that you can follow: Selenium Interview Questions Verify that the test is correctly recorded: Make sure that the test is recorded correctly and that all the elements and commands are in the correct order. Check the test for syntax errors: Selenium IDE will alert you if there are any syntax errors in the test, so make sure to check for and fix any errors. Check the test for compatibility issues: Make sure that the test is compatible with the browser and version that you are using to run the test. Check the test for missing elements: Make sure that all the elements used in the test are present on the web page. Run the test in debug mode: Selenium IDE provides a debug mode that allows you to step through the test and check the values of variables and the state of the web page at each step. Check the browser's developer tools: The browser's developer tools can be used to inspect the web page and check for any issues. Check the log messages: Selenium IDE provides a log panel where you can view log messages generated by the test. This can be useful for troubleshooting issues. Check the Selenium documentation: The Selenium documentation provides information on the diﬀerent commands and options available in Selenium IDE, which can be helpful for troubleshooting. Finally, you can also seek help from the Selenium community and forums, where you can ask questions and get help from other Selenium users."
85. What steps can be taken to resolve an issue where a Selenium script only works properly on Google Chrome but not Internet Explorer? Here are some possible steps that can be taken to resolve an issue where a Selenium script only works properly on Google Chrome but not Internet Explorer: Selenium Interview Questions
"1. Verify that the correct version of Internet Explorer is being used: Selenium supports diﬀerent versions of Internet Explorer, so make sure that you are using a version that is compatible with your Selenium script."
2. Check the Internet Explorer settings: Make sure that Internet Explorer's security settings are configured correctly and that the browser is not running in compatibility mode.
3. Check the Selenium WebDriver version: Make sure that you are using the latest version of the Selenium WebDriver for Internet Explorer.
4. Check the browser's developer tools: Use the browser's developer tools to inspect the web page and check for any issues.
5. Check the log messages: Selenium provides log messages that can be helpful for troubleshooting issues.
"6. Check the Internet Explorer documentation: The Internet Explorer documentation provides information on the diﬀerent options and settings available in Internet Explorer, which can be helpful for troubleshooting."
"7. Use a diﬀerent browser: If the above steps do not resolve the issue, you may want to consider using a diﬀerent browser that is supported by Selenium, like Firefox or Microso"
"8. You can also try to seek help from the Selenium community and forums, where you can ask questions and get help from other Selenium users."
"86. Is it possible to open pop-up windows with Selenium? Yes, it is possible to open pop-up windows with Selenium. Selenium WebDriver provides methods to interact with browser windows, so you can use Selenium to open new windows, switch between windows, and close windows. You can open a new window using the window_handles method, and switch to the new window using the switch_to.window() method. Once you have switched to the new window, you can interact with the elements on the pop-up window just like you would interact with elements on the main window. You can also use the Alert class of Selenium WebDriver to handle JavaScript alerts and confirmations. Selenium Interview Questions It's worth noting that, while some browsers may block pop-ups by default, you need to configure the browser settings to allow pop-ups for the testing website. It's also important to use explicit waits to handle the dynamic nature of the web pages and pop-ups, as the time taken for a pop-up window to load may vary depending on the browser, internet connection, and other factors."
"87. Can selenium be used to launch web browsers? Yes, Selenium provides good support to launch web browsers like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer, etc. The following commands can be used to launch web browsers using Selenium: WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver(); WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver(); WebDriver driver = new InternetExplorerDriver();"
"88. Is it possible to use only perform() without build()? Yes, it is possible to use the perform() method without calling the build() method. The build() method is used to construct and return an instance of the ActionChains class, which is a container for a series of actions. However, if you don't call build(), the actions will be performed immediately when you call perform(). actions.move_to_element(element).click().perform() The above line of code is an example of using perform() without calling build(). The move_to_element(), click() methods are chained together and the perform() method is used to execute all the chained actions. However, it is important to note that, perform() method is used to execute all the chained actions only a"
"89. What is StaleElementReferenceException? When does this occur? And how to overcome such exceptions? Selenium Interview Questions StaleElementReferenceException is an exception that is thrown in Selenium WebDriver when a web element that was previously found on a web page is no longer available or has been deleted from the DOM (Document Object Model). This can happen if the web page has been refreshed, the element has been removed or replaced, or the element's parent element has been removed or replaced. This exception occurs when the element is no longer attached to the DOM, which means that the element can no longer be interacted with using the WebDriver. There are a few ways to overcome this exception: Re-find the element: You can re-find the element by using the WebDriver's find_element or find_elements methods again. try: element.click() except StaleElementReferenceException: element = driver.find_element_by_id('element_id') element.click() Wait for the element to be available: You can use explicit waits such as WebDriverWait and ExpectedConditions to wait for the element to be available before interacting with it. from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait try: element.click() except StaleElementReferenceException: wait = WebDriverWait(driver, 10) element = wait.until(EC.presence_of_element_located((By.ID, 'element_id'))) element.click() Refresh the page: You can refresh the page using the refresh() method of the WebDriver instance and then re-find the element. Selenium Interview Questions try: element.click() except StaleElementReferenceException: driver.refresh() element = driver.find_element_by_id('element_id') element.click() It is important to note that this exception is a run-time exception, so it's best to catch it and handle it in the code, rather than letting the script crash."
90. What are test design techniques? Explain BVA and ECP with some examples. Test design techniques are the methods or strategies used to design and create test cases for a so
1. Black Box Testing: Testing the functionality of the so
2. White Box Testing: Testing the internal structure or code of the so
3. Grey Box Testing: Combining both Black Box and White Box testing methods.
4. Boundary Value Analysis (BVA): This technique is used to test the so
5. Equivalence Class Partitioning (ECP): This technique is used to divide the input domain of the so
"1. In a login form, test the minimum and maximum length of the password field."
"2. For a form field that accepts a date, testing the so"
"1. In a form field that accepts a phone number, divide the input domain into three classes: valid phone numbers, phone numbers that are too short, and phone numbers that are too long."
"Git Interview Questions Due to a well-established version control system and the support for collaborative work, git has garnered wide popularity not just amongst the so"
"1. What is a version control system (VCS)? A VCS keeps track of the contributions of the developers working as a team on the projects. They maintain the history of code changes done and with project evolution, it gives an upper hand to the developers to introduce new code, fixes bugs, and run tests with confidence that their previously working copy could be restored at any moment in case things go wrong."
2. What is a git repository? A repository is a file structure where git stores all the project-based files. Git can either stores the files on the local or the remote repository.
"3. What does git clone do? The command creates a copy (or clone) of an existing git repository. Generally, it is used to get a copy of the remote repository to the local repository."
"4. What does the command git config do? The git config command is a convenient way to set configuration options for defining the behavior of the repository, user information and preferences, git installation-based configurations, and many such things. For example: To set up your name and email address before using git commands, we can run the below commands: Git Interview Questions git config --global user.name “<<your_name>>” git config --global user.email “<<your_email>>”"
"5. Can you explain head in terms of git and also tell the number of heads that can be present in a repository? A head is nothing but a reference to the last commit object of a branch. For every repository, there will always be a default head referred to as “master” or now “main” (as per GitHub) but there is no restriction to the count of heads available. In other words, it can have any number of heads. Usages: - To go or checkout to 1 commit before the latest commit, we use git checkout HEAD~1 - To uncommit the last 3 commits without losing the changes, we first run git reset HEAD~3. Then we can see the changes made in the last 3 commits and then update it manually and commit it finally. - In order to uncommit the last 3 commits and also remove the changes, we can run the command: git reset --hard HEAD~3. This command will completely remove all the changes. - To look into the changes made in the last 3 commits, we can run git diff HEAD~3 - To make a new commit by reverting the last 3 commits, we can run the command: git revert --no-commit HEAD~3...HEAD"
"6. What is a conflict? Git Interview Questions Git usually handles feature merges automatically but sometimes while working in a team environment, there might be cases of conflicts such as:"
1. When two separate branches have changes to the same line in a file
2. A file is deleted in one branch but has been modified in the other. These conflicts have to be solved manually a
7. What is the functionality of git ls-tree? This command returns a tree object representation of the current repository along with the mode and the name of each item and the SHA-1 value of the blob.
8. What does git status command do? git status command is used for showing the diﬀerence between the working directory and the index which is helpful for understanding git in-depth and also keep track of the tracked and non-tracked changes.
"9. Define “Index”. Git Interview Questions Before making commits to the changes done, the developer is given provision to format and review the files and make innovations to them. All these are done in the common area which is known as ‘Index’ or ‘Staging Area’. In the above image, the “staged” status indicates the staging area and provides an opportunity for the people to evaluate changes before committing them."
10. What does git add command do? This command adds files and changes to the index of the existing directory. You can add all changes at once using git add . command. You can add files one by one specifically using git add <file_name> command. You can add contents of a particular folder by using git add /<folder_name>/ command. Intermediate GIT Interview Questions
"11. Why is it considered to be easy to work on Git? Git Interview Questions With the help of git, developers have gained many advantages in terms of performing the development process faster and in a more eﬀicient manner. Some of the main features of git which has made it easier to work are: Branching Capabilities: - Due to its sophisticated branching capabilities, developers can easily work on multiple branches for the diﬀerent features of the project. - It also has an easier merge option along with an eﬀicient work-flow feature diagram for tracking it. Distributed manner of development: - Git is a distributed system and due to this nature, it became easier to trace and locate data if it's lost from the main server. - In this system, the developer gets a repository file that is present on the server. Along with this file, a copy of this is also stored in the developer’s system which is called a local repository. - Due to this, the scalability of the project gets drastically improved. Pull requests feature: - This feature helps in easier interaction amongst the developers of a team to coordinate merge-operations. - It keeps a proper track of the changes done by developers to the code. Eﬀective release cycle: - Due to the presence of a wide variety of features, git helps to increase the speed of the release cycle and helps to improve the project workflow in an eﬀicient manner."
"12. How will you create a git repository? Git Interview Questions Have git installed in your system. Then in order to create a git repository, create a folder for the project and then run git init. Doing this will create a .git file in the project folder which indicates that the repository has been created."
13. Tell me something about git stash? Git stash can be used in cases where we need to switch in between branches and at the same time not wanting to lose edits in the current branch. Running the git stash command basically pushes the current working directory state and index to the stack for future use and thereby providing a clean working directory for other tasks.
"14. What is the command used to delete a branch? To delete a branch we can simply use the command git branch –d [head]. To delete a branch locally, we can simply run the command: git branch -d <local_branch_name> To delete a branch remotely, run the command: git push origin --delete <remote_branch_name> Deleting a branching scenario occurs for multiple reasons. One such reason is to get rid of the feature branches once it has been merged into the development branch."
15. What diﬀerentiates between the commands git remote and git clone? git remote command creates an entry in git config that specifies a name for a particular URL. Whereas git clone creates a new git repository by copying an existing one located at the URL.
16. What does git stash apply command do? Git Interview Questions git stash apply command is used for bringing the works back to the working directory from the stack where the changes were stashed using git stash command. This helps the developers to resume their work where they had last le
17. Diﬀerentiate between git pull and git fetch. git pull git fetch This command pulls new changes from the currently working branch located in the remote central repository.This command is also used for a similar purpose but it follows a two step process:
1. Pulls all commits and changes from desired branch and stores them in a new branch of the local repository. current
"2. For changes to be reflected in the current / target branch, git fetch should be followed by git merge command. git pull = git fetch + git merge"
18. Can you give diﬀerences between “pull request” and “branch”? Git Interview Questions pull request branch This process is done when there is a need to put a developer’s change into another person’s code branch. A branch is nothing but a separate version of the code.
19. Why do we not call git “pull request” as “push request”? “Push request” is termed so because it is done when the target repository requests us to push our changes to it. “Pull request” is named as such due to the fact that the repo requests the target repository to grab (or pull) the changes from it.
20. Can you tell the diﬀerence between Git and GitHub? Git Interview Questions Git GitHub This is a distributed version control system installed on local machines which allow developers to keep track of commit histories and supports collaborative work.This is a cloud- based source code repository developed by using git. This is maintained by “The Linux Foundation”.This was acquired by “Microso
"21. What do the git diﬀ and git status commands do? git diﬀ git status This shows the changes between commits, working trees, etc.This shows the diﬀerence between the working directory and index that is essential in understanding git in depth. Git Interview Questions git diff works in a similar fashion to git status with the only diﬀerence of showing the diﬀerences between commits and also between the working directory and index."
22. What has to be run to squash multiple commits (last N) into a single commit? Squashing multiple commits to a single one overwrites the history which is why it is recommended to be done using full caution. This step can be done by running the command: git rebase -i HEAD~{{N}} where {{N}} represents the number of commits needed to be squashed.
23. How would you recover a branch that has already pushed changes in the central repository but has been accidentally deleted from every team member’s local machines? We can recover this by checking out the latest commit of this branch in the reflog and then checking it out as a new branch.
"24. Can you tell something about git reflog? This command tracks every single change made in the repository references (that can be branches or tags) and also maintains the branches/tags log history that was either created locally or checked out. Reference logs such as the commit snapshot of when the branch was created or cloned, checked-out, renamed, or any commits made on the branch are maintained by Git and listed by the ‘reflog’ command. This recovery of the branch is only possible when the branch was either created locally or checked-out from a remote repository in your local repository for Git to store its reference history logs. This command should be executed in the repository that had the lost branch."
25. What consists of a commit object? A commit object consists of the following components: Git Interview Questions A set of files that represents the state of a project at a given point in time. Reference to parent commit objects. A 40 character string termed as SHA-1 name uniquely identifies the commit object.
"26. Explain the levels in git config and how can you configure values using them? In order to make git work, it uses a set of configurations that are pre-defined by default by means of configuration files (or config files). We can change the default behavior of git by just modifying these files which are basically text files. In order to do this, it is important to understand how git identifies these files. It does so by following the below steps: - Firstly, git searches for the config values in the system-wide gitconfig file stored in <<installation_path>>/etc/gitconfig file that has settings defined and applied to every user of the system and all their repos. - In case you want git to search from this particular file and read/write on it, we can pass the option --system to git config command. - Next, git searches for the ~/.gitconfig file or ~/.config/git/config that has the scope specific to the user. - Git can be made to read/ write from this file specifically bypassing --global to the git config command. - Lastly, git searches for the config values in the git directory of the local repository that we are currently working on. - These config values are specific to that particular repository alone and can be accessed by passing --local to the git config command.This is the default config file that gets accessed and modified upon in case we do not specify any levels."
"27. What is a detached HEAD and what causes this and how to avoid this? Git Interview Questions Detached HEAD indicates that the currently checked-out repository is not a local branch. This can be caused by the following scenarios: When a branch is a read-only branch and we try to create a commit to that branch, then the commits can be termed as “free-floating” commits not connected to any branch. They would be in a detached state. When we checkout a tag or a specific commit and then we try to perform a new commit, then again the commits would not be connected to any branch. When we now try to checkout a branch, these new commits would be automatically placed at the top. In order to ensure that detached state doesn't happen, =instead of checking out commit/tag, we can create a branch emanating from that commit and then we can switch to that newly created branch by using the command: git checkout - b <<new_branch_name>>. This ensures that a new branch is checkout out and not a commit/tag thereby ensuring that a detached state wouldn't happen."
28. What does git annotate command do? This command annotates each line within the given file with information from the commit which introduced that change. This command can also optionally annotate from a given revision. Syntax: git annotate [<options>] <file> [<revision>] You can get to learn more about this command from the oﬀicial git documentation here.
29. What is the diﬀerence between git stash apply vs git stash pop command? git stash pop command throws away the specified stash (topmost stash by default) a
30. What command helps us know the list of branches merged to master? git branch --merged helps to get the list of the branches that have been merged into the current branch. Note: git branch --no-merged lists the branches that have not been merged to the current branch.
"31. How will you resolve conflict in Git? Conflicts occur whenever there are multiple people working on the same file across multiple branches. In such cases, git won't be able to resolve it automatically as it is not capable of deciding what changes has to get the precedence. Following are the steps are done in order to resolve git conflicts:"
1. Identify the files that have conflicts.
2. Discuss with members who have worked on the file and ensure that the required changes are done in the file.
3. Add these files to the staged section by using the git add command.
4. Commit these changes using the git commit command.
"5. Finally, push the changes to the branch using the git."
"32. What is best advisable step in cases of broken commit: Create an additional commit OR amend an existing commit? Git Interview Questions It is always advisable to create an additional commit rather than amending the existing commit due to the following reasons: - Doing the amend operation destroys the previously saved state of that commit. If only the commit message gets changes or destroyed, it's acceptable but there might be cases when the contents of the commits get amended. This results in the loss of important information associated with the commit. - Over usage of git commit --amend can have severe repercussions as the small commit amend can continue to grow and gather unrelated changes over time."
"33. How to revert a bad commit which is already pushed? There can be cases where we want to revert from the pushed changes and go back to the previous version. To handle this, there are two possible approaches based on the situations: Approach 1: Fix the bad changes of the files and create a new commit and push to the remote repository. This step is the simplest and most recommended approach to fix bad changes. You can use the command: git commit -m "" <message>"" Approach 2: New commit can be created that reverts changes done in the bad commit. It can be done using git revert <name of bad commit>"
34. What is the functionality of “git cherry-pick” command? This command is used to introduce certain commits from one branch onto another branch within the repository. The most common use case is when we want to forward- or back-port commits from the maintenance branch to the development branch.
35. Explain steps involved in removing a file from git index without removing from the local file system? Git Interview Questions Sometimes we end up having certain files that are not needed in the git index when we are not being careful while using the git add command. Using the command git rm will remove the file from both the index and the local working tree which is not always desirable. Instead of using the git rm command we can use the git reset command for removing the file from the staged version and then adding that file to the .gitignore file to avoid repeating the same mistake again. git reset <file_name> # remove file from index echo filename >> .gitingore # add file to .gitignore to avoid mistake repetition.
"36. What are the factors involved in considering which command to choose among: git merge and git rebase? Both these commands ensure that changes from one branch are integrated into another branch but in very diﬀerent ways. Git rebasing can be thought of as saying to use another branch as a new base for the work. Git Interview Questions Whenever in doubt, it is always preferred to use the git merge command. Following are some factors that tell when to use merge and rebase commands: In case our branch gets contributions from other developers outside the team as in open-source or public repositories, then rebase is not preferred. - This is because rebase destroys the branch and it results in broken and inconsistent repositories unless the git pull --rebase command is used. Rebase is a very destructive operation. If not applied correctly, it results in loss of committed work which might result in breaking the consistency of other developer’s contribution to the repository. If the model of having branches per feature is followed, rebasing is not a good idea there because it keeps track of related commits done by the developers. But in case the team follows having branches per developer of the team, then the branch has no additional useful information to be conveyed. In this model, rebasing has no harm and can be used. If there is any chance where there might be a necessity to revert a commit to previous commits, then reverting a rebase would be almost impossible as the commit data would be destroyed. In such cases, the merge can be used."
37. How do you find a commit which broke something a
38. What are the functionalities of git reset --mixed and git merge --abort? git reset --mixed command is used for undoing changes of the working directory and the git index. git merge --abort command is used for stopping the merge process and returning back to the state before the merging occurred.
"39. Can you tell the diﬀerences between git revert and git reset? git revert git reset This command is used for creating a new commit that undoes the changes of the previous commit.This command is used for undoing the local changes done in the git repository Using this command adds a new history to the project without modifying the existing historyThis command operates on the commit history, git index, and the working directory. "
"WebMethods Interview Questions The questions presented in this article have been hand-picked based on what is likely to be asked in an interview. Before we begin, let's understand what webMethods is all about. What is WebMethods? In its simplest form, WebMethods is an API management and integration platform that focuses on business process integration, internal A2A (application to application) integration, and B2B (business to business) partner integration. This platform simplifies integration and can build solutions rapidly and easily. Now that webMethods 10.11 is available, you can automate everything you need by using integrations, APIs, and microservices. These updates make webMethods a unified platform that addresses the needs of the modern enterprise, including both your business and your partners, as well as your customers. It provides an easy-to-use graphical tool for generating flow services that map from any data format into another and connect diﬀerent applications. There are many e-standards supported by WebMethods, including XML (Extensible Markup Language), Rosetta Net, EDI (Electronic data interchange), etc. It enables enterprises to rapidly integrate systems, services, devices, processes, business partners and data to provide new business value and improve business performance. Now let's look at the most common WebMethods Interview Questions for both freshers and experienced candidates. WebMethods Interview Questions for Freshers"
"1. List some Components of WebMethods. WebMethods Integration platform provides components for designing, executing, and managing integration solutions. You can categorize these components as follows: WebMethods Interview Questions Runtime components: Run the Integration solution you developed. WebMethods Integration server: In webMethods, it is one of the core application servers. It's a multiplatform and Java-based enterprise integration server. Integration of diverse services, such as the conversion of data between formats and communication between systems, is supported by this component. WebMethods Broker: It is a high-performance message router. The Publish- Subscribe Model supports both synchronous and asynchronous message- based integrations. WebMethods Trading networks (TN): Trading networks are an essential part of the webMethods product suite that facilitates B2B transactions. This component runs on the webMethods IS (Integration server) and allows your firm to interact with external companies, generally referring to them as partners and marketplaces, etc. WebMethods Adapters: Adapters run on webMethods IS (Integration server). These adapters connect back-end resources in the enterprise to the integration platform. Webmethods workflow: A set of activities performed by several individuals. MywebMethods Server: As a major component of the webMethods Suite, it plays a critical role in providing the UI (User Interface) framework so that customers can develop Web, portlet, and BPM (Business process management) applications. Moreover, my webMethods Server provides a central administration and monitoring platform for most of the webMethods Suite's products. Design-time components: These components provide tools for designing and integrating solutions. WebMethods Developer: This is the IDE (Integrated development environment) that allows you to open sessions on IS (Integration server) and develop your services. WebMethods workflow Designer: It is used to develop and deploy workflows. A customized Eclipse-based tool, WebMethods Designer can be used for a wide variety of purposes, including service development, CAF (Composite Application Framework) page design and coding, and deployment to the My WebMethods Server. WebMethods Modeler: It is a graphical tool used for designing and implementing business processes. WebMethods Interview Questions"
"2. What are the modules in the WebMethods Product Suite? The webMethods Product Suite comprises four modules, as follows: Service-Oriented Architecture. Integration and B2B (Business to Business). Business Activity Monitoring. Business Process Management."
"3. What is the Role of a WebMethods Developer? This is the Java-based IDE (Integrated development environment) that allows you to open sessions on WebMethods IS (Integration server) and develop your services. It is used to develop code on WebMethods IS. In addition, it also supports the development of integration applications in WebMethods Flow. Webmethod flow is a graphical programming language specially used to simplify and speed up the development of integration applications. Since version 7 of webMethods, webMethods Developer has been replaced by a new Eclipse-based IDE called webMethods Designer. As of yet, this transition has not been completed, and both products exist side by side."
"4. Explain what you mean by flow service. Flow services are services written in the webMethods flow language. With a flow service, you can encapsulate a sequence of services into a single service and manage the data flow between them. Example: Suppose, for example, you created a flow service that accepts purchase orders from buyers and executes the following series of services before submitting them to your internal ordering system: WebMethods Interview Questions Receives a purchase order submitted by the buyer. Record the order in an audit trail. Performs credit checks. Posts the order in the ordering system."
"5. What is the process for changing the order of steps in a flow service? The arrows connecting the flow steps in the Layout tab show how (sequence) the steps are executed. It is possible to change the order that steps are executed in a flow service by moving or relocating steps. Also, a step can be relocated as a child of another step in the flow service. Changing the sequence of steps in a flow service on the Layout tab Click the Layout tab, then select the step whose execution order you wish to change. You can change the location of flow steps using the buttons, i.e., Cut, Copy, and Paste on the toolbar or in the context menu. Changing the sequence of steps in a flow service on the editor panel You can change the steps by pressing the 'Shi"
"6. What is the Startup service and Shutdown service? WebMethods Interview Questions As part of the startup and shutdown services section of the Properties dialog box, you can specify what services webMethods Integration Server should automatically execute when packages are loaded into memory or unloaded from memory. Startup Service: This displays the list of startup services a package can use, as well as the list of startup services assigned to a package. When a webMethods Integration Server loads a package into memory, it automatically executes a startup service. A startup service is useful to generate initialization files and prepare the environment (like setting up or cleaning up) before a package is loaded. Shutdown Service: This displays the list of shutdown services a package can use, as well as the list of shutdown services assigned to a package. When a webMethods Integration Server unloads a package from memory, it automatically executes a shutdown service. Shutdown services are useful for performing cleanup tasks like closing files and cleaning temporary data. In addition, they can be used to capture state information or work-in-progress before a package is unloaded."
"7. Explain the primary function of the built-in pub.flow:savePipeline service. The pub.flow:savePipeline service is used to save the current pipeline to a specific location in memory on the Integration Server. Pipelines are stored in memory and can be retrieved later with the pub.flow:restorePipeline service. Pub.flow:restorePipeline service restores a pipeline that has previously been saved by pub.flow:savePipeline. If that savePipeline is successfully invoked, a snapshot of pipeline fields will be saved under the key specified by $name. A pipeline is identified in memory by the string name ""$name"". If this value is not provided, an exception will be thrown."
"8. Describe what happens when you invoke the pub.flow:tracePipeline service and pub.flow:clearPipeline. WebMethods Interview Questions When you invoke the pub.flow:tracePipeline service, the names, and values of all pipeline fields are written to the server log. When you invoke pub.flow:clearPipeline, all pipeline fields are removed or cleared. You can specify fields that shouldn't be removed/cleared using this service."
"9. What is the purpose of web service connectors? When Integration Server creates consumer web service descriptors, it creates web service connectors which is a flow service. The web service connector usually contains logic and information/data required to invoke an operation specified in a WSDL (Web Service Description Language) document used to create the consumer web service descriptor. As Integration Server creates consumer web service descriptors based on WSDL documents, it creates web service connectors for each operation the portType contains in the WSDL document. If, for example, a WSDL document contains 2 portType declarations, each of which contains 3 operations, then Integration Server creates a total of 6 web service connectors."
"10. How can a service be invoked from a browser? The 'Run in Browser' command enables you to run a service from a browser. Using this command, Designer prompts you for input values of service, creates the URL (Uniform Resource Locator) that is needed to invoke the service based on the input values you provide and passes the URL to your browser. If you use the 'Run in Browser' command to run a service, the browser (not Designer) triggers or invokes the service and receives the results. Open your browser and enter the following URL to invoke a service: http://servername:port/invoke/folder.subFolder.subsubFolder/serviceName"
"11. Is it possible to change the JDK (Java Development Kit) used by Integration Server? WebMethods Interview Questions To switch or change the JDK used by webMethods, you must edit IntegrationServer/bin/server.sh or IntegrationServer/bin/server.bat used to start Integration Server. Save the file a"
"12. State diﬀerence between a drop and delete pipeline variable. Dropping a variable from Pipeline In or Pipeline Out will remove it from the pipeline. If pipeline variables aren't being used by subsequent services, they can be dropped. By removing unneeded variables, you reduce the size of the pipeline at run time, as well as the complexity of the Pipeline In and Pipeline Out displays. This can make the Pipeline view much more usable when you are working with a complicated flow. The term ""drop pipeline"" implies an explicit cleanup. Delete is a design-time operation that removes a variable from the current view. It is only useful if you create a variable by mistake. When you change the view in developer a"
"13. How will you check memory usage? Here are two methods to check memory usage: Top command: It provides a dynamic, real-time view of the current state of the system. You can view system information and process information, including up- time, average load, running tasks, number of logged-in users, and RAM usage. Also, you can view the processes that your users are running/using on your server. Free command: Top command, however, can sometimes be too much for your purposes. If all you need is to see how much memory is free and used on your system, you can use the free command."
14. What are the steps to open a session on a diﬀerent server? WebMethods Interview Questions Open the Integration Server and click the 'session' menu on the toolbar. Please enter the IP address and port details for the server you wish to connect to. Enter the username and password and simply click 'Connect'.
"15. Explain UDDI (Universal, Description, Discovery and Integration). UDDI stands for Universal, Description, Discovery, and Integration. UDDI is a platform-independent standard that describes SOA (Service Oriented Architecture) registry and its interface. By using UDDI, clients can discover registered businesses (organizations or service providers) and their web services. Furthermore, UDDI provides APIs for creating and updating registry information. UDDI defines a set of APIs that can be used to access and modify data stored in the registry. Some of these APIs are as follows: UDDI Inquiry: Through this API, you can find registry entries and retrieve their information. UDDI Publication: You can add new entries to the registry with this API or edit existing ones. UDDI Security: It determines which security settings are applied to registry entities."
"16. What is Integration Server in WebMethods? webMethods Integration Server is one of the core application servers in the webMethods platform. It is a Java-based, multiplatform enterprise integration server. It supports the integration of diverse services, such as mapping data between formats and communication between systems."
17. What is an Enterprise Service Bus? So
"18. Explain data transformation. In most cases, systems do not produce data in the exact format that other systems require, so you o"
19. Is there a way to see the Java code for the flow service? Flow service is not curved or turned into Java code. It resides as XML on the disk on behalf of the flow operations. A
"20. How do we restore a session on the server? In case of server failure or network problems, the developer becomes disconnected from the server. The developer should not be closed, as closing the developer prevents you from saving the changes. Upon resolving the server/network problem, the developer will get connected to the server automatically, and the session will be restored. WebMethods Interview Questions"
"21. How can the existing pipeline be preserved before the restorePipeline step? Pipelines are stored in memory using the pub.flow:savePipeline service, and can be retrieved later with the pub.flow:restorePipeline service. There is an input parameter in restorePipeline called $merge that indicates whether the values in the existing pipeline should be merged with those in the saved pipeline. You can set $merge to ""true"" or ""false"". False: $merge is set to false to clear existing pipelines before restoring saved pipelines. By default, it is set to false. True: When $merge is set to true, the existing pipeline will be merged with the saved pipeline. When a field appears in both the saved pipeline and the existing pipeline, the saved field prevails. You can preserve the existing pipeline by setting the ""$merge"" variable in restorePipeline to true. In this way, everything in the pipeline is preserved before the restorePipeline step."
"22. Can a system lock be removed from an element? Locking an element prevents it from being edited by another user. Locks can be either user locks or system locks. An element that is locked by the user is a user lock. All other users can read, but not modify the element until you unlock it. A system lock occurs when the server administrator marks or sets the element's supporting files (like node.xml) as read-only on the Integration Server. To edit an element, the server administrator must remove the system lock from the element (allow the element's files to be modified). A"
"23. Is it possible to sort using the JDBC select adapter service? Even though there is no 'order by' tab, the same functionality is available in the 'SELECT' tab. It has a column titled ""Sort Order"" that allows you to specify which column you wish to sort by. Simply change the order of the columns selected to alter the order. WebMethods Interview Questions"
"24. How will you use SEQUENCE as the Target of a BRANCH? There may be times a BRANCH step is needed if you want to conditionally run/execute a series or number of multiple steps instead of just one (single step). In such cases, you can utilize or use the SEQUENCE step as the target step and group a series of flow steps below it (beneath). Example: An example is given below in which a service accepts a purchase order. Based on the payment type specified in the PaymentType variable, the purchase order is processed in one of three ways. Since each PO (purchase order) requires a series of steps to be completed, the targets of the BRANCH are designated as SEQUENCE steps, and the appropriate set of flow steps is listed as a child of each SEQUENCE (children beneath each SEQUENCE). Consider the SEQUENCE step as the target of a multi-step alternative Describe a multi-step alternative in a sequence WebMethods Interview Questions"
"25. Explain branch operation. Conditional processing is supported by the branch operation. It is similar to an ""if- then-else"" statement that can be found in languages such as Java. To create a BRANCH operation, Incorporate/Add the BRANCH step to the service. Specify or set a BRANCH condition. Add logic to perform the transformation once the condition is met."
"26. If we want to repeat an operation as long as a repeat condition is met, how do we set the count parameter? To repeat an operation as long as the specified condition is met, we need to set the count parameter to '-1'."
27. An HTTP listener is assigned by default to which port on the webMethods Integration Server? webMethods Integration Server has an HTTP listener assigned by default to the 5555 port.
28. What do you mean by client groups? WebMethods Interview Questions A client group generally consists of a list of clients and configures which documents the clients can subscribe to and bring out. The WebMethods Broker administrator defines and maintains client groups. There are names for each client group.
"29. How to organize connection pools? There should be two separate connections if you are using adapter notifications and adapter services. If not, you may receive strange errors regarding transactions, etc. Moreover, don't share connection pools with diﬀerent functional areas, even when they point to the same database. If you share connection pools with diﬀerent functional areas then: Tuning or changing the size of the pool can become quite challenging if you have diﬀerent types of usage of the pool. It is also diﬀicult to change individual database settings without aﬀecting the others. Having separate pools for each package generally seems to work fairly well (though not a hard and fast rule), since your packages are generally divided up according to the functional area."
"30. Explain what is EAI (Enterprise application integration). EAI stands for Enterprise Application Integration. To overcome the lack of communication between enterprise applications, Enterprise Application Integration (EAI) technologies are implemented to facilitate communication among enterprise applications. This is a technology that makes it possible to interact and share data among connected applications and data sources across organizations and enterprises. It bridges the gap between diﬀerent systems and enables data flow among heterogeneous systems. Advantages: WebMethods Interview Questions Streamlines business processes and increases organizational eﬀiciency. Real-time information sharing among systems. Ensures accuracy of data across multiple systems. Faster transactions at a lower cost. If there is a problem with one of the applications and it needs to be shut down, EAI makes it easy to ""decouple"" it from the rest of the system. By doing so, the rest of the systems are not aﬀected."
"31. What eﬀect does ACLs (Access Control List) have on locking? The lock feature lets you control access at the user (individual) level, whereas ACLs let you control access by groups of users. ACLs provide authorization to specific user groups. By giving ACL access to the administrator, all admin group members included in the group will have access to the specific service."
32. What is the best way to change the logging date format for WebMethods Integration Server? The date format to be used in log files is specified by the watt.server.dateStampFmt parameter. It is best to edit the watt.server.dateStampFmt in the server.cnf file to change the logging date format for WebMethods Integration Server. This parameter specifies the date format to be used in the server log file as well as in the Integration Server Administrator.

"Explain data abstraction.? Data abstraction is a technique used in computer programming to separate the implementation details of a data type from its interface, allowing the implementation to be changed without affecting the code that uses it. This is often achieved through the use of abstract data types (ADTs), which are defined by the operations they support rather than their specific implementation, or through the use of interfaces and classes in object-oriented programming languages. Data abstraction helps to reduce the complexity of software systems by allowing code to be written in a modular and flexible way and by hiding the underlying details of data types from the user."
"What is a syntax error? A syntax error is an error in the structure of a programming language's code. It occurs when the code does not conform to the rules of the programming language's syntax. Syntax errors can occur for a variety of reasons, such as using the wrong punctuation, omitting required elements, or using an incorrect keyword. Syntax errors are usually detected by a compiler or interpreter when the code is being compiled or executed, and they can prevent the code from running correctly. To fix a syntax error, the code must be revised to conform to the correct syntax of the programming language."
"Explain program documentation. Why is it important? Program documentation is written information that describes the design and functionality of a computer program. It can include information about the purpose of the program, the structure of the code, the algorithms used, and the input and output data. Program documentation is important because it helps to make the code easier to understand and maintain. It can be used to document the design decisions made during the development process, which can be helpful for future developers working on the same codebase. Program documentation can also be used as a reference for using the program, and can be helpful for users who are unfamiliar with the code. Overall, program documentation helps to improve the quality and reliability of the code, and makes it easier to modify and update in the future."
"What is software testing? Software testing is the process of evaluating a software system or its component(s) with the intent of finding whether it satisfies the specified requirements or not. Software testing can be done manually or with the use of automated tools. It helps to identify errors, gaps, or missing requirements in the software. There are various types of software testing, including unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and acceptance testing, each of which has a specific focus and purpose. Software testing is an important part of the software development process because it helps to ensure that the software is of high quality and fit for its intended purpose."
"How do you explain a data structure? A data structure is a way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. Different types of data structures are suited to different kinds of applications, and some are highly specialized to specific tasks. Some common data structures include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs. Data structures are an important part of computer science because they provide a means of organizing and storing data in a way that is efficient and easy to use. They are used in many areas of computing, including operating systems, database management systems, and computer networking."
"Explain what a binary search tree is.? A binary search tree (BST) is a tree-based data structure in which each node has at most two children and all the nodes in the left subtree of a node have a value less than the node's value, and all the nodes in the right subtree have a value greater than the node's value. This structure allows for fast searching, insertion, and deletion of elements. Binary search trees are often used to store data that needs to be retrieved quickly, such as in the implementation of a dictionary or set data type. They are also used in many other applications, such as for storing and organizing data in databases and for optimizing search algorithms."
"What are dynamic data structures? Dynamic data structures are data structures that can change in size during the execution of a program. This is in contrast to static data structures, which have a fixed size that is determined when the program is compiled. Dynamic data structures are often implemented using pointers, which allow them to allocate and deallocate memory as needed. Some common dynamic data structures include linked lists, stacks, queues, and trees. Dynamic data structures are useful because they can adapt to changing data needs and do not require the programmer to know the size of the data in advance. However, they can be more complex to implement and may have slower performance than static data structures in some cases."
"Can you explain doubly linked list? A doubly linked list is a linear data structure in which each element is a node that contains a value and two pointers. One pointer points to the previous element in the list, and the other pointer points to the next element in the list. This allows for traversal of the list in both directions. Doubly linked lists are often used when it is necessary to efficiently insert or delete elements from the middle of the list, as they allow for easy manipulation of the pointers. They can also be used to implement stacks and queues. However, doubly linked lists require more memory than some other data structures because each node requires two pointers, rather than just one."
"What is logistic regression? In machine learning, logistic regression is a type of algorithm used to classify data points into one of two categories. It is a supervised learning algorithm, meaning it requires a labeled dataset to train on. Given a set of input features and a label indicating which category the data point belongs to, the algorithm learns a function that maps the input features to the label. Once trained, the model can be used to predict the label for new, unseen data points. Logistic regression is a popular choice for binary classification problems because it is relatively simple to implement and interpret, and it tends to perform well on a wide range of datasets. It uses sigmoid function as an activation function"
"Describe decision tree? A decision tree is a type of machine learning algorithm that is used for classification and regression tasks. It is a tree-like model of decisions and their possible consequences, represented graphically. Each internal node of the tree represents a decision based on the value of a feature, and each leaf node represents a predicted outcome. The tree is constructed by learning from a training dataset, which includes input features and labels indicating the correct category for each data point. To make a prediction for a new, unseen data point, the algorithm follows the path down the tree, making decisions based on the values of the input features and ultimately arriving at a prediction for the label. Decision trees are widely used because they are easy to understand and interpret, and they can handle both categorical and numerical data."
"Explain confusion matrix? A confusion matrix is a table that is used to evaluate the performance of a classification algorithm. It is a summary of the predictions made by the algorithm, with the actual class labels on one axis and the predicted class labels on the other. The table shows the number of times each combination of actual and predicted labels occurred. The confusion matrix can be used to calculate various performance metrics, such as precision, recall, and accuracy, which give an indication of how well the algorithm is able to predict the correct class labels. It is a useful tool for understanding the strengths and weaknesses of a classification algorithm and for identifying areas for improvement."
"What is bias in data science? Bias in data science refers to the systematic error or deviation of a model or algorithm from the true underlying relationship it is attempting to model. Bias can occur for a variety of reasons, such as a poorly chosen model, incomplete or unrepresentative data, or incorrect assumptions about the data. Bias can have negative consequences, such as leading to inaccurate or unfair predictions or decisions. For example, a biased model might consistently overestimate or underestimate the value of a certain variable, or it might unfairly favor certain groups over others. It is important to identify and address bias in data science to ensure that models and algorithms are accurate and fair. This can be done through careful data selection and preprocessing, model selection and evaluation, and ongoing monitoring and testing."
"What is dimensionality reduction? Dimensionality reduction is a technique used to reduce the number of dimensions (features) in a dataset while preserving as much of the information as possible. It is often used as a preprocessing step before applying machine learning algorithms, as it can help to simplify data, reduce computational complexity, and improve the performance of the model. There are several methods for dimensionality reduction, including feature selection, feature extraction, and manifold learning. Dimensionality reduction is an important tool for working with high-dimensional datasets, which can be difficult to analyze and visualize, and can help to reduce overfitting, improve the interpretability of the results, and reduce the computational cost of training the model."
"What is DBMS? A database management system (DBMS) is a software application that is used to create, manage, and manipulate databases. A database is a collection of data that is organized in a specific way, allowing for efficient retrieval and manipulation of the data. A DBMS provides a set of tools and interfaces that allow users to create, modify, and query the database, as well as to control access to the data and maintain the integrity and consistency of the data. DBMSs are widely used in a variety of applications, including financial systems, customer relationship management systems, and online shopping systems. They are an essential component of many business and organization systems, as they allow for the efficient storage and management of large amounts of data."
"Explain normalization and de-normalization in databases.? Normalization is the process of organizing a database in a way that minimizes redundancy and dependency. It involves breaking down a large table into smaller, more specialized tables, and establishing relationships between them using foreign keys. The goal of normalization is to reduce data redundancy, improve data integrity, and make it easier to modify the database structure. De-normalization is the process of reversing normalization, by combining tables or adding redundant data back into the database. It is often done to improve the performance of certain types of queries, at the expense of increased redundancy and a more complex database structure. De-normalization is used in cases where the benefits of faster query performance outweigh the drawbacks of increased data redundancy and complexity. Both normalization and de-normalization are important concepts in database design, and the appropriate approach depends on the specific requirements and goals of the database."
"What is BCNF? How it is different from 3NF? BCNF (Boyce-Codd Normal Form) is a normal form in database design that is used to ensure that a database is free of certain types of anomalies and dependency issues. It requires that every determinant in the database be a candidate key, which is a set of attributes that uniquely identifies each row in a table. BCNF is more restrictive than 3NF (Third Normal Form), which only requires that the database be in 2NF (Second Normal Form) and that all the non-key attributes in the database be fully dependent on the primary key. BCNF can result in a more complex database structure, with more tables and foreign keys, but it can help to ensure that the database is well-organized and easy to maintain and modify."
"What is a degree of relation in DBMS? The degree of a relation in a database management system (DBMS) refers to the number of attributes it has. A relation with a single attribute is called a unary relation, a relation with two attributes is called a binary relation, and a relation with three or more attributes is called a ternary or higher-order relation. The degree of a relation is an important concept in database design, as it affects the structure and organization of the data."
"Give an explanation on the difference between strong AI and weak AI? Strong AI, also known as artificial general intelligence, refers to artificial intelligence systems that have the ability to perform any intellectual task that a human can. In other words, strong AI systems have a general and flexible intelligence that allows them to adapt to and learn new tasks, rather than being specifically designed for a single task or set of tasks. Weak AI, also known as artificial narrow intelligence, refers to artificial intelligence systems that are designed for a specific task or set of tasks. These systems are not capable of adapting to new tasks or learning new skills. They are often designed to perform a specific function, such as recognizing faces in images or playing a game like chess. In summary, the main difference between strong AI and weak AI is the scope and flexibility of their intelligence. Strong AI systems are capable of adapting to and learning new tasks, while weak AI systems are limited to the specific tasks they were designed for."
"Define an expert system in AI? An expert system is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) system that is designed to mimic the decision-making abilities of a human expert in a particular domain. Expert systems are often used in fields where specialized knowledge is required, such as medicine, engineering, and finance. Expert systems typically consist of a knowledge base, which contains information and rules about the domain, and an inference engine, which uses the knowledge base to draw conclusions and make recommendations. The knowledge base is usually created by experts in the field, who input their knowledge and expertise into the system. The inference engine uses this knowledge to make decisions and provide recommendations based on a set of input data."
"What Are recurrent neural networks? Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are a type of artificial neural network that are designed to process sequential data. They are particularly useful for tasks that involve processing data with a temporal dimension, such as language translation, speech recognition, and time series prediction. RNNs are composed of units called neurons, which are connected together in a network and are able to pass information from one unit to the next. Unlike traditional neural networks, which process data in a feedforward manner, RNNs have feedback connections, which allow them to retain information from previous time steps and use it to process the current time step. This makes them well-suited for tasks that involve processing data with a temporal dimension, as they are able to consider the context and dependencies between time steps."
"What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised machine learning? Supervised machine learning and unsupervised machine learning are two categories of machine learning algorithms that are used to train models on data. In supervised machine learning, the training data includes both input features and labeled output values. The goal of supervised learning is to train a model to make predictions about the output values given the input features. This requires the availability of labeled data, which can be used to train the model and evaluate its performance. Examples of supervised learning tasks include classification, regression, and prediction. In unsupervised machine learning, the training data includes only input features and no labeled output values. The goal of unsupervised learning is to find patterns and relationships in the data, rather than making predictions about specific output values. This requires the model to learn from the data itself, without the guidance of labeled outputs. Examples of unsupervised learning tasks include clustering and dimensionality reduction. In summary, the main difference between supervised and unsupervised learning is the availability of labeled data. Supervised learning requires labeled data, while unsupervised learning does not."
"What do you understand by the hyperparameter? Hyperparameters are parameters that are set before training a machine learning model. They are not learned from the training data, but rather are set manually by the developer. Hyperparameters control the behavior and performance of the model, and can have a significant impact on the accuracy and generalization of the model. Examples of hyperparameters include the learning rate for gradient descent, the regularization coefficient, the number of hidden units in a neural network, and the depth of a decision tree. These hyperparameters are set before training the model, and their values are used to control the training process and the resulting model. Hyperparameter optimization is the process of finding the best values for the hyperparameters of a machine learning model. This can be done manually, through trial and error, or using automated methods such as grid search or random search. Hyperparameter optimization is an important step in the process of developing a machine learning model, as it can have a significant impact on the performance of the model."
"What are bayesian networks? Bayesian networks are a type of probabilistic graphical model that represent the dependencies between different variables. They are used to represent and reason about uncertain or probabilistic information. Bayesian networks consist of a directed acyclic graph (DAG), in which the nodes represent variables and the edges represent the dependencies between the variables. The variables can be binary (e.g., true/false) or continuous (e.g., real numbers). Each variable is associated with a probability distribution that describes its possible values and the likelihood of each value occurring. The edges in the graph represent the relationships between the variables, and the probabilities in the distributions are used to capture the dependencies between the variables. Bayesian networks are useful for representing complex systems with many variables and dependencies, and can be used to make predictions about the values of variables given the values of other variables. They are commonly used in fields such as machine learning, artificial intelligence, and data analysis."
"What is encryption? Encryption is the process of converting plain text or data into a coded or unreadable form, often to prevent unauthorized access or tampering. It is commonly used to secure data transmission over the internet or to protect sensitive information stored in databases or other digital systems.

"What are the Five Dimensions of Risk? The five dimensions of risk are as follows: i. Schedule: Unrealistic timelines, such as building a large piece of software in a single day. ii. Client: Unclear requirements, changing requirements, and ambiguous requirements descriptions. iii. Human Resource: Lack of sufficient resources with the required expertise for the project. iv. System assets: An unfavorable outcome will result from the inability to acquire all necessary resources, including hardware and software tools or licenses. v. Quality: Product quality will be impacted by multiple factors, such as a lack of resources, a strict delivery timetable, and frequent modifications."
"What Do You Understand About Regression Testing? Which Test Cases Should be Selected for this Process? Regression testing is testing performed to ensure that a software update wonât impact how the product currently operates. Practical regression tests may use the test cases listed below: If features are apparent, users can see more of them. Scenarios that examine the core properties of the product Case studies of functionality that have undergone significant and recent changes Every Integration Test Case All Comprehensive Test Cases Examples of boundary value tests A variety of failure test case examples"
Distinguish Between Severity and Priority.? Severity: The degree to which a specific flaw can affect the software is known as its severity. The parameter of âseverityâ describes how the defect affects the softwareâs functionality. Priority: A characteristic that determines the sequence in which a defect should be addressed is called a priority. The first defect that needs to be corrected is the one with the highest importance.
"What is the Difference Between Functional and Non-Functional Testing? Functional Testing: Functional testing validates each software function or feature. Functional testing focuses on the clientâs needs. Functional testing aims to validate program actions. Functional testing example would be to verify the login process. Functional describes what the product performs, whereas Non-Functional describes how the product operates. Functional testing is conducted before nonfunctional testing. Non-Funtional Testing: Non-functional testing validates nonfunctional elements, including performance, usability, and reliability. Non-functional testing is challenging to execute manually. non-functional testing is based on the customerâs expectations. Non-functional testing confirms software performance. Non-functional testing example would ascertain that the dashboard should load within two seconds. Non-functional testing is performed after functional testing."
"How Do You Decide When to Stop Testing? Sometimes, as project managers or project leads, we may have to cancel testing to launch the product sooner. In those circumstances, we must determine whether the product has received sufficient testing from the testers. When deciding when to halt testing in real-time projects, various considerations must be taken into account: If the testing or release deadlines are met. By entering the determined test case pass rate. If the risk in the real-time project is below the permitted level. If all the critical bugs and roadblocks have been resolved. If the submission meets the requirements."
"Differentiate Between Load Testing And Stress Testing.? The purpose of each is what makes a difference: Through load testing, you can learn how a system responds to a predicted load. Stress testing enables you to comprehend the maximum loads at which a system can function. In other words, stress tests show you how a system might respond to heavy demand, such as a DDoS attack, the Slashdot effect, or different scenarios. In this manner, you might be ready for unforeseen occurrences. On the other hand, load tests ensure you fulfill user expectations, such as service level agreement (SLA) obligations. So instead of breaking the application, the objective is to guarantee a satisfactory overall user experience. It enables you to deploy new code with assurance."
"What is Ad-hoc Testing? Adhoc testing is a causal method of software testing. It does not adhere to established procedures such as test plans, test cases, and requirement documentation. Adhoc testing has the following traits: It is done on an application after formal testing is finished. Its primary goal is to malfunction the program without a predetermined procedure. Adhoc testers should be well knowledgeable about the product they are testing."
"What is a Bug Life Cycle? The status of a new defect, is set to New when it is initially logged and posted. ii. Assigned After the tester posts a bug, the testerâs lead reviews the bug and designates it for the developing team. iii. Open The developer gets to work on the defect fix and analysis. iv. Fixed A developer may mark an issue as fixed once the required code modifications have been made and verified. v. Retest The tester retests the code to see if the developer has fixed the issue. If not, then the status is changed to retest. vi. Reopen Once the developer has fixed the bug, but it still exists, the tester switches the status to Reopen, and the bug runs through the bug life cycle. vii. Verified After the developer has corrected the bug, the tester retests it if no bugs are discovered, the status is changed to Verified. viii. Closed The status is changed to Closed if the bug is no longer present. ix. Duplicate The status is changed to Duplicate if the defect occurs twice or if it shares the same concept as the prior problem. x. Rejected The status is changed to Rejected if the developer believes the flaw is not there. xi. Deferred If the bug can be patched in the upcoming release and does not have a higher priority, the status becomes Deferred."
"What Do You Understand About Bug/ Defect Triage in the Context of Quality Assurance? Software testing generally employs Defect Triage, commonly referred to as Bug Triage. It is necessary to describe the faultsâ importance and seriousness. The severity of a problem is determined by how it affects the application being tested. Priority is the sequence in which a flaw must be corrected or resolved. Defect triage is essentially a method that aims to rebalance the process, which is typically problematic for the test team due to a lack of necessary resources. Defects are usually prioritized in defect triage based only on their severity, likelihood of recurrence, and risk."
"What is your approach to test planning? Compare test plan vs test strategy? Waterfall vs. Agile testing Waterfall or Agile, choosing between the two really depends on what will work for a team. Agile is meant to address the demand of higher iteration and deployment frequency. But if a team only requires releasing new code every once in a while, say a month, then Waterfall sequential and linear testing would still make sense. The same applies for risk-based, model-based, hybrid or other approaches. Test plan vs. test strategy A test plan outlines what to be done to execute a test strategy. A test strategy sets the high-level direction with different tactics and plans. Since itâs giving a high-level overview, a test strategy will be applied across products and releases to standardize how quality engineering will be done. On the contrary, a test plan goes a level lower to give more on the details of things like testing types, tools and timelines."
"What is exploratory testing? Exploratory testing is a testing approach that involves simultaneous learning, test design, and execution. It is employed when there is no formalized test plan or script, and when there is a need to discover issues not yet covered by existing test cases. Exploratory testing is typically performed by experienced testers who use their domain knowledge, intuition, and creativity to identify defects in the software."
"Explain stress testing, load testing and volume testing? Stress testing, load testing, and volume testing are all non-functional testing types used to assess the performance of an application under real-world scenarios. Stress testing puts the application under extreme conditions beyond the normal operating parameters. It aims to identify the breaking point of the system and how it behaves when it reaches its limits. Testers gradually increase the load on the application beyond its normal capacity until it fails or by creating a sudden spike in the load to see how the system responds. The insights from stress testing sessions allow the developers to better manage damage to the system when issues occur. Load testing involves testing the application under varying levels of normal user load to determine how well the system can handle normal amounts of traffic. Load testing helps to identify performance bottlenecks, such as slow response times, high CPU usage, and memory leaks. Volume testing involves testing the application with a large amount of data to determine how well it can handle data processing. It aims to identify performance issues such as slow response times, data corruption, and data loss that may occur when the application is processing a large amount of data."
"What is the difference between TDD vs BDD? TDD is a development approach to drive software testability. BDD is also a development approach, but drives the design of software via an end-userâs perspective. Test driven development or TDD aims to ensure code testability by knowing exactly what you want your software to do. Some existing codebase was not designed with testing in mind, leading to less maintainable code and fear of refactoring. And no, TDD isnât entirely dictating the structure of code. Instead, this methodology wants to use software tests to influence well thought out software implementation as opposed to just banging out code. BDD prescribes a more effective approach to testing by communicating technical slangs and concepts into easy-to-understand English. Itâd be impossible to not have any business stakeholders like clients or product managers in software projects."
"What is performance testing? Performance testing evaluates the system's performance (i.e. responsiveness, scalability, stability, and speed) under varying workload conditions. Its goal is to determine how the application behaves under normal and peak usage scenarios, such as high user traffic, large data volumes, or simultaneous user interactions. The results of performance testing will be used to identify and resolve bottlenecks, optimize system performance, and enhance the user experience."
"What is accessibility testing? Accessibility testing is the process of evaluating a software application or website's usability for all users, including people with disabilities, such as visual, auditory, motor, and cognitive impairments. It tests the appâs compatibility with assistive technologies such as screen readers, magnifiers, and voice recognition software."
"Explain end to end testing in your own words. Compare End to End Testing vs Integration Testing? End-to-end testing evaluates the entire application flow from start to finish, to ensure that all integrated components of the software system work together as expected. Integration testing looks at how individual integrated components, from the API to UI, work. The test pyramid is always the best theory to refer back to 3 test levels: unit, integration and end-to-end testing."
"How do you perform visual testing? Visual testing can be performed manually, where the tester checks the application visually for inconsistencies. This can be time-consuming and prone to human error. Many testers employ the Image Comparison technique, which involves capturing screenshots of the UI elements in a baseline state, then comparing them with screenshots of the actual UI to see if there are any unintended visual changes. However, even this approach is not the best. There are so many factors that may cause false positives in visual testing. Using visual testing tools can reduce false positives and make the process more efficient."
"How do you prioritize test cases for execution? There are many criteria to consider when prioritizing test cases for execution. Below is a list of 9 most common criteria QA professionals use: Business impact: test cases that are verify critical flows (e.g., Login, Checkout) Risk (test cases of high-risk areas in the app) Frequency of use (test cases for features used by large numbers of users) Dependencies Complexity Customer or user feedback (test cases that address customersâ pain points) Compliance requirements (test cases covering regulations specific to the industry) Historical data (test cases that have historically resulted in defects or issues) Test case age (old test cases may require updates and maintenance)"
"What are the key components of a good test case? Know when manual or automated testing would be best. Use appropriate design method (e.g., data-driven testing) for different requirements and scenarios. Test cases should be designed to be scalable and reusable, so that they can be leveraged across different testing cycles or projects to save time and effort. Each test case should have a unique identifier or name to make it easy to reference and filter for regression testing Test data inputs should cover happy and negative inputs to uncover edge cases Tests should run on environments (browser, device and operating system) that end-users use the most They should be stored in a centralized repository or test management tool to allow for easy access, maintenance, and reporting. QA testers should design independent test cases, so that the execution of one test case does not impact the results of another."
"What are defect triage meetings? Defect triage meetings are used to prioritize and assign defects to the appropriate team members. During defect triage meetings, QA testers present the defects identified during testing, including their severity and priority, and discuss the potential impact of the defects on the project."
"Explain API Testing and show your approach to API Testing? API testing is key because almost every application type is heavily reliant on APIs. The UI and API are interlaced, making it even more critical to understand how data and logic processes from one layer to the other. Here are what to consider when designing an API test: Read the API documentation: understand the specifications for functionalities and technologies of the APIs to write test cases with clear objectives Architectural style: schemas written in REST, GraphQL and SOAP differ in concepts and implementation which makes testing them different as well Automate data-driven tests: let API flows parse through various data types, formats, structures, and scenarios End-points management: avoid duplicating or missing scenarios by grouping API/web services endpoints"
"How do you ensure that test cases are comprehensive and cover all possible scenarios? Although it is not always feasible to cover ALL possible scenarios, testers should try to venture beyond the happy path i.e. testing the app under normal conditions. Apart from the common test cases, QA testers also need to consider edge cases, and negative scenarios, which are test scenarios that involve unusual or unexpected inputs or usage patterns. Attackers are more likely to exploit non-standard scenarios, so including such scenarios in your test plan is a great way to improve test coverage."
"What is your approach to identifying and reporting defects? Many QA testers follow these steps to identify and report newly found defects: Replicate the defect and gather relevant information such as steps to reproduce, screenshots, logs, and system configurations. Assign a severity level to the defect based on its impact on the application and users. Log the defect in a tracking tool with a clear description, expected vs. actual results, and steps to reproduce. Communicate the defect to the development team and collaborate with them to identify the root cause and potential solutions. Continuously follow up on the defect until it is resolved and verified to be fixed."
How do you measure the effectiveness of your testing efforts? There are several testing metrics to consider: Test case execution rate Test coverage Defect density Defect rejection rate Mean time to failure (MTTF)
"What are test management tools? Test management tools are used by testing teams to manage and organize their testing activities. These tools provide features to manage test cases, test plans, test execution, and test reporting."
"What is your experience with implementing an automation testing tool? Identify areas for automation testing and prioritize them based on impact Evaluate and select appropriate automation testing tool based on technical requirements Define KPIs and success criteria for automation testing and establish continuous monitoring and reporting mechanism Train testing team on automation tool and test plan and establish necessary governance, policies, and procedures Track automation testing tool effectiveness and make adjustments if needed"
"How do you manage your QA team? This question is designed to learn more about your management style. Not just in QA, managers in any industry need to have good communication skills, empathy to understand diverse perspectives, good leadership skills to connect a diverse group of testers together, and have accountability for the performance of the whole team."
"What is the difference between the QA and software testing? The role of QA (Quality Assurance) is to monitor the quality of the âprocessâ used to produce the software. While the software testing, is the process of ensuring the functionality of final product meets the userâs requirement."
"What is Testware? Testware is test artifacts like test cases, test data, test plans needed to design and execute a test."
What is the difference between build and release? Build: It is a number given to Installable software that is given to the testing team by the development team. Release: It is a number given to Installable software that is handed over to the customer by the tester or developer.
"What are the automation challenges that SQA(Software Quality Assurance) team faces while testing? Mastering the automation tool, Reusability of Automation script, Adaptability of test case for automation, Automating complex test cases."
"What is bug leakage and bug release? ug release is when software or an application is handed over to the testing team knowing that the defect is present in a release. During this the priority and severity of bug is low, as bug can be removed before the final handover. Bug leakage is something, when the bug is discovered by the end users or customer, and not detected by the testing team while testing the software."
"What is data driven testing?  Data driven testing is an automation testing framework, which tests the different input values on the AUT. These values are read directly from the data files. The data files may include csv files, excel files, data pools and many more."
"What does the test strategy include?  The test strategy includes an introduction, resource, scope and schedule for test activities, test tools, test priorities, test planning and the types of test that has to be performed."
"What is branch testing and what is boundary testing?  The testing of all the branches of the code, which is tested once, is known as branch testing. While the testing, that is focused on the limit conditions of the software is known as boundary testing."
"What is Agile testing and what is the importance of Agile testing?  Agile testing is software testing, is testing using Agile Methodology. The importance of this testing is that, unlike normal testing process, this testing does not wait for the development team to complete the coding first and then doing testing. The coding and testing both goes simultaneously. It requires continuous customer interaction."
"What is Test case?  Test case is a specific condition to check against the Application Under Test. It has information of test steps, prerequisites, test environment, and outputs."
What is quality audit?  The systematic and independent examination for determining the effectiveness of quality control procedures is known as the quality audit.
"What is a âUSEâ case and what does it include?  The document that describes, the user action and system response, for a particular functionality is known as USE case. It includes revision history, table of contents, flow of events, cover page, special requirements, pre-conditions and post-conditions."
"What is CRUD testing and how to test CRUD?  CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update and Delete. CRUD testing can be done using SQL statements."
What is a cause effect graph? A cause effect graph is a graphical representation of inputs and the associated outputs effects that can be used to design test cases.
Explain what is traceability matrix? A test matrix is used to map test scripts to requirements.
"Mention what are the types of documents in SQA? The types of documents in SQA are:Requirement Document, Test Metrics, Test cases and Test plan, Task distribution flow chart, Transaction Mix, User profiles, Test log, Test incident report, Test summary report"
"Explain what should your QA documents include? QA testing document should include: List the number of defects detected as per severity level, Explain each requirement or business function in detail, Inspection reports, Configurations, Test plans and test cases, Bug reports, User manuals, Prepare separate reports for managers and users"
Explain what is MR and what information does MR consists of? MR stands for Modification Request also referred as Defect report. It is written for reporting errors/problems/suggestions in the software.
"What should the Software QA document include? Software QA document should include:Specifications,Designs,Business rules,Configurations,Code changes,Test plans,Test cases,Bug reports,User manuals, etc"
"How would you manage a testing issue? This question attempts to uncover how you might handle problems during your testing, which may include manual testing, automation testing, and test strategies. The interviewer might like to hear about how you manage issues with the software test itself. Explain to the interviewer what your general steps may include before asking your supervisor. Example: ""Depending on the issue, I may rerun my test to ensure the testing was being implemented correctly. If the problem persisted, I can then restart the software and testing environment to make sure everything was working on the testing side. If problems persisted after a couple of minutes, I may talk to my supervisor or manager so I can manage my time wisely."""
"What are the steps of an automation test plan? While the individual automation test plans differ from company to company, an interviewer may want to understand your knowledge of implementing an automation test and what steps you may include. Your answer can allow you to highlight your extensive experience in managing a software automation test. Example: ""I would follow the company's strategy and record the scenario while incorporating an error handler. I would then debug the script and fix the issues as needed, rerun the script and track the results of the fix."""
"Have you ever written test cases without documents? Your answer to this question depends on whether or not you have written test cases without documents. If you have, explain your prior experience in writing test cases. When you lack experience with writing test cases without documents, you can still explain what your process may include and how they align with quality standards. Example: ""Yes, sometimes there aren't any documents. When this happened before, I looked into past tests or performed minor research to get an idea of the feature being implemented. If the information was limited, I contacted someone from the development team to understand the changes, and in some cases, I collaborated with one of the developers."""
"What is the difference between load testing, volume testing and stress testing? There are many types of software testing, and these three types of testing are the most common among software testers and quality assurance engineers. It's important for your answer to show the interviewer that you have legitimate experience in multiple types of software testing and understand the difference between them all. Example: ""Load testing is when you test the software under a heavier load that is still in the expected range, whereas stress testing is when you test the software under a much heavier load that goes outside the expected range. This type of testing proves if the system can handle errors while heavily loaded. Volume testing, also known as flood testing, is just a system check to find out if the software can manage the expected data or requests."""
"What is a bug? A bug is any kind of error, mistake or failure in software code that prevent the software function from executing properly."
"What is the difference between severity and priority? These are important distinctions that must be known for proper time management. Severity is how difficult the issue is to fix. Priority is how important the issue is to fix. Just because an issue is high severity doesnât necessarily mean itâs high priority and vice versa. Hereâs an example of a high-severity, low-priority issue: The application crashes when a rarely used function is run on legacy software that most users canât access. Hereâs an example of a low-severity, high-priority issue: The wrong company logo is displayed on startup."
"When should QA start? QA should begin as soon as possible. The earlier QA analysts, QA testers, and QA team leads get involved in the process the more headaches are prevented later in the software development cycle. Static tests can be performed before the software is fully functional."
"What is a test plan? A test plan is a document that outlines the details of the intended test. It states before testing begins the required roles, potential risks and solutions, and resources it will use."
"What is a Test Strategy? The test strategy outlines the plan for the testing stage of software development. Unlike the test plan, which describes one specific test, the test strategy covers the entire testing phase of development and includes a description of the testing tools, test groups, test priorities, test record maintenance, and the test summary."
"What are some different kinds of testing? Regression testing, exploratory testing, functional testing, load testing, integration testing, unit testing, cross-browser testing white box testing, black box testing, volume testing, alpha testing, beta testing, and so many more."
What is a good test case? A good test case clearly states the parameters in which the test will be performed and the bugs it hopes to find.
"When you find a bug in production, how do you ensure the bug gets resolved? The best course of action is to immediately write a test case for the bug and run a regression test. That way any future tests performed on the software should check specifically for that bug."
"How do you prioritize when you have so many tasks? Think about how youâve approached busy moments in the past. Are you a strict scheduler? Or do you prefer budgeting your time more loosely, allowing room to adapt to sudden issues? Again, these testing interview questions are more about determining whether youâre a good personality fit for their team."
"What is software testing? Software testing is a process to assess the quality, functionality, and performance of a software product before it is launched. Testers carry out this process either by interacting with the software manually or running test scripts to automatically check for bugs and errors, ensuring that the software functions as intended. Additionally, software testing is conducted to verify the fulfillment of business logic and identify any gaps in requirements that require immediate attention."
"Explain the Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC)? The Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC) is a systematic process that QA teams follow when conducting software testing. The stages in an STLC are designed to achieve high test coverage, while maintaining test efficiency.  There are 6 stages in the STLC: 1. Requirement Analysis: During this stage, software testers collaborate with stakeholders in the development process (developers, business analyst, clients, product owner, etc.) to identify and comprehend test requirements. The information gathered from this discussion is compiled into the Requirement Traceability Matrix (RTM) document. This document is the foundation of the test strategy. 2. Test Planning: from a comprehensive test strategy, we develop a test plan, in which details about objectives, approach, scope of the testing project, test deliverables, dependencies, environment, risk management, and schedule are noted down. It is a more granular version of the test strategy. 3. Test Case Development: Depending on whether teams want to execute the tests manually or automatically, weâll have different approaches to this stage. Certain test cases are more suitable to be executed manually, while some should be automated to save time. Generally, in manual testing, testers write down the specific steps of the test case in a spreadsheet and document the results there, while in automated testing, the test case is written as a script using a test automation framework like Selenium. 4. Environment Setup: QA teams set up the hardware-software-network configuration to conduct their testing based on their plan. There are many environments to run a test on, either locally, remotely, or on cloud. 5. Test Execution: The QA team prepares test cases, test scripts, and test data based on clear objectives. Tests can be done manually or automatically. Manual testing is used when human insights and judgment are needed, while automation testing is preferred for repetitive flows with minor changes. Defects found during testing are tracked and reported to the development team, who promptly address them. 6. Test Cycle Closure: This is the last stage of Software Testing. Software testers will come together to examine their findings from the tests, assess how well they worked, and record important lessons to remember in the future. It's important to regularly assess your QA team's software testing procedure to maintain control over all testing activities throughout the STLC phases."
"Define the term ""test plan"" and describe its components.? A test plan is like a detailed guide for testing a software system. It tells us how we'll test, what we'll test, and when we'll test it. The plan covers everything about the testing, like the goals, resources, and possible risks. It makes sure that the software works well and is of good quality."
"What is the purpose of the traceability matrix in software testing? The traceability matrix in software testing is a crucial document for ensuring comprehensive test coverage and establishing a clear link between various artifacts throughout the software development and testing life cycle. Its primary purpose is to trace and manage the relationships between requirements, test cases, and other relevant artifacts."
"Explain the differences between static testing and dynamic testing. Provide examples of each.? Static testing involves reviewing and analyzing software artifacts without executing the code. Examples of static testing include code reviews, inspections, and walkthroughs. Dynamic testing involves executing the code to validate its behavior. Examples of this type include unit testing, integration testing, and system testing."
"Does Python allow you to program in a structured style? Yes., Python allows to code in a structured as well as Object-oriented style. It offers excellent flexibility to design and implement the application code depending on the requirements of the application."
"What is PIP software in the Python world? PIP stands for Python Installer Package, which provides a seamless interface to install the various Python modules. It is a command-line tool that searches for packages over the Internet and installs them without any user interaction."
"What should be the typical build environment for Python-based application development? The best and easiest tool used to âunit testâ is the python standard library, which is also used to test the units/classes. Its features are similar to the other unit testing tools such as JUnit, TestNG."
"How does for Loop and while Loop differs in Python and when do you choose to use them? âforâ Loop is generally used to iterate through the elements of various collection types such as List, Tuple, Set, and Dictionary. Developers use a âforâ loop where they have both the conditions start and the end. âwhileâ loop is the actual looping feature that is used in any other programming language. Developers use a while loop where they just have the end conditions. This is how Python differs in handling loops from the other programming languages."
"How do you make use of Arrays in Python? Python does not have in-built data structures like arrays, and it does not support arrays. However, you can use List which can store an unlimited number of elements."
What is the best way to parse strings and find patterns in Python? Python has built-in support to parse strings using the Regular expression module.
Which databases are supported by Python? MySQL (Structured) and MongoDB (Unstructured) are the prominent databases that are supported natively by Python. Import the module and start using the functions to interact with the database.
"What are the assumptions required for linear regression? What if some of these assumptions are violated? There are four assumptions associated with a linear regression model:
Linearity: The relationship between X and the mean of Y is linear.
Homoscedasticity: The variance of the residual is the same for any value of X.
Independence: Observations are independent of each other.
Normality: For any fixed value of X, Y is normally distributed.
Extreme violations of these assumptions will make the results redundant. Small violations of these assumptions will result in a greater bias or variance of the estimate."
"What is collinearity? What is multicollinearity? How do you deal with it? Collinearity is a linear association between two predictors. Multicollinearity is a situation where two or more predictors are highly linearly related.
This can be problematic because it undermines the statistical significance of an independent variable. While it may not necessarily have a large impact on the modelÃ¢ÂÂs accuracy, it affects the variance of the prediction and reduces the quality of the interpretation of the independent variables.
You could use the Variance Inflation Factors (VIF) to determine if there is any multicollinearity between independent variables Ã¢ÂÂ a standard benchmark is that if the VIF is greater than 5 then multicollinearity exists."
"What are the drawbacks of a linear model? There are a couple of drawbacks of a linear model:
A linear model holds some strong assumptions that may not be true in application. It assumes a linear relationship, multivariate normality, no or little multicollinearity, no auto-correlation, and homoscedasticity.
A linear model canÃ¢ÂÂt be used for discrete or binary outcomes.
You canÃ¢ÂÂt vary the model flexibility of a linear model."
"What are ridge and lasso regression and what are the differences between them? Both L1 and L2 regularization are methods used to reduce the overfitting of training data. Least Squares minimizes the sum of the squared residuals, which can result in low bias but high variance. L2 Regularization, also called ridge regression, minimizes the sum of the squared residuals plus lambda times the slope squared. This additional term is called the Ridge Regression Penalty. This increases the bias of the model, making the fit worse on the training data, but also decreases the variance. If you take the ridge regression penalty and replace it with the absolute value of the slope, then you get Lasso regression or L1 regularization. L2 is less robust but has a stable solution and always one solution. L1 is more robust but has an unstable solution and can possibly have multiple solutions."
"How does K-Nearest Neighbor work? K-Nearest Neighbors is a classification technique where a new sample is classified by looking at the nearest classified points, hence Ã¢ÂÂK-nearestÃ¢ÂÂ. In the example above, if k=1 then the unclassified point would be classified as a blue point.
If the value of k is too low, it can be subject to outliers. However, if itÃ¢ÂÂs too high, it may overlook classes with only a few samples."
"How can you select k for k means? You can use the elbow method, which is a popular method used to determine the optimal value of k. Essentially, what you do is plot the squared error for each value of k on a graph (value of k on the x-axis and squared error on the y-axis). Once the graph is made, the point where the distortion declines the most is the elbow point."
"Why is Naive Bayes Ã¢ÂÂnaiveÃ¢ÂÂ? Naive Bayes is naive because it holds a strong assumption in that the features are assumed to be uncorrelated with one another, which typically is never the case."
What are the support vectors in SVM? The support vectors are the data points that touch the boundaries of the maximum margin.
What is pruning in decision trees? Pruning is a technique in machine learning and search algorithms that reduces the size of decision trees by removing sections or branches of the tree that provide little to no power for classifying instances.
"What are random forests? Why is Naive Bayes better? Random forests are an ensemble learning technique that builds off of decision trees. Random forests involve creating multiple decision trees using bootstrapped datasets of the original data and randomly selecting a subset of variables at each step of the decision tree. The model then selects the mode of all of the predictions of each decision tree. By relying on a Ã¢ÂÂmajority winsÃ¢ÂÂ model, it reduces the risk of error from an individual tree. Random forests offer several other benefits including strong performance, can model non-linear boundaries, no cross-validation needed, and gives feature importance.
Naive Bayes is better in the sense that it is easy to train and understand the process and results. A random forest can seem like a black box. Therefore, a Naive Bayes algorithm may be better in terms of implementation and understanding. However, in terms of performance, a random forest is typically stronger because it is an ensemble technique."
"When would you use random forests Vs SVM and why? There are a couple of reasons why a random forest is a better choice of an algorithm than a support vector machine:
Random forests allow you to determine the feature importance. SVMÃ¢ÂÂs canÃ¢ÂÂt do this.
Random forests are much quicker and simpler to build than an SVM.
For multi-class classification problems, SVMs require a one-vs-rest method, which is less scalable and more memory intensive."
"Do you think 50 small decision trees are better than a large one? Why? Another way of asking this question is Ã¢ÂÂIs a random forest a better model than a decision tree?Ã¢ÂÂ And the answer is yes because a random forest is an ensemble method that takes many weak decision trees to make a strong learner. Random forests are more accurate, more robust, and less prone to overfitting."
"WhatÃ¢ÂÂs the difference between an AdaBoosted tree and a Gradient Boosted tree? AdaBoost is a boosted algorithm that is similar to Random Forests but has a couple of significant differences:
Rather than a forest of trees, AdaBoost typically makes a forest of stumps (a stump is a tree with only one node and two leaves).
Each stumpÃ¢ÂÂs decision is not weighted equally in the final decision. Stumps with less total error (high accuracy) will have a higher say.
The order in which the stumps are created is important, as each subsequent stump emphasizes the importance of the samples that were incorrectly classified in the previous stump.
Gradient Boost is similar to AdaBoost in the sense that it builds multiple trees where each tree is built off of the previous tree. Unlike AdaBoost which builds stumps, Gradient Boost builds trees with usually 8 to 32 leaves.
More importantly, Gradient differs from AdaBoost in the way that the decisions trees are built. Gradient boost starts with an initial prediction, usually the average. Then, a decision tree is built based on the residuals of the samples. A new prediction is made by taking the initial prediction + a learning rate times the outcome of the residual tree, and the process is repeated."
"What is the bias-variance tradeoff? The bias of an estimator is the difference between the expected value and true value. A model with a high bias tends to be oversimplified and results in underfitting. Variance represents the modelÃ¢ÂÂs sensitivity to the data and the noise. A model with high variance results in overfitting.
Therefore, the bias-variance tradeoff is a property of machine learning models in which lower variance results in higher bias and vice versa. Generally, an optimal balance of the two can be found in which error is minimized."
"Explain what the bootstrap sampling method is and give an example of when itÃ¢ÂÂs used.? Technically speaking, the bootstrap sampling method is a resampling method that uses random sampling with replacement. ItÃ¢ÂÂs an essential part of the random forest algorithm, as well as other ensemble learning algorithms."
"What is the difference between bagging and boosting? Bagging, also known as bootstrap aggregating, is the process in which multiple models of the same learning algorithm are trained with bootstrapped samples of the original dataset. Then, like the random forest example above, a vote is taken on all of the modelsÃ¢ÂÂ outputs. Boosting is a variation of bagging where each individual model is built sequentially, iterating over the previous one. Specifically, any data points that are falsely classified by the previous model is emphasized in the following model. This is done to improve the overall accuracy of the model. Once the first model is built, the falsely classified/predicted points are taken in addition to the second bootstrapped sample to train the second model. Then, the ensemble model (models 1 and 2) are used against the test dataset and the process continues."
"How does XGBoost handle the bias-variance tradeoff? XGBoost is an ensemble Machine Learning algorithm that leverages the gradient boosting algorithm. In essence, XGBoost is like a bagging and boosting technique on steroids. Therefore, you can say that XGBoost handles bias and variance similar to that of any boosting technique. Boosting is an ensemble meta-algorithm that reduces both bias and variance by takes a weighted average of many weak models. By focusing on weak predictions and iterating through models, the error (thus the bias) is reduced. Similarly, because it takes a weighted average of many weak models, the final model has a lower variance than each of the weaker models themselves."
"What is cross-validation? Cross-validation is essentially a technique used to assess how well a model performs on a new independent dataset.
The simplest example of cross-validation is when you split your data into three groups: training data, validation data, and testing data, where you use the training data to build the model, the validation data to tune the hyperparameters, and the testing data to evaluate your final model."
"What is the difference between online and batch learning? Batch learning, also known as offline learning, is when you learn over groups of patterns. This is the type of learning that most people are familiar with, where you source a dataset and build a model on the whole dataset at once.
Online learning, on the other hand, is an approach that ingests data one observation at a time. Online learning is data-efficient because the data is no longer required once it is consumed, which technically means that you donÃ¢ÂÂt have to store your data."
"Give several ways to deal with missing values? There are a number of ways to handle null values including the following:
You can omit rows with null values altogether
You can replace null values with measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode) or replace it with a new category (eg. Ã¢ÂÂNoneÃ¢ÂÂ)
You can predict the null values based on other variables. For example, if a row has a null value for weight, but it has a value for height, you can replace the null value with the average weight for that given height.
Lastly, you can leave the null values if you are using a machine learning model that automatically deals with null values."
"Is mean imputation of missing data acceptable practice? Why or why not? Mean imputation is the practice of replacing null values in a data set with the mean of the data.
Mean imputation is generally bad practice because it doesnÃ¢ÂÂt take into account feature correlation. For example, imagine we have a table showing age and fitness score and imagine that an eighty-year-old has a missing fitness score. If we took the average fitness score from an age range of 15 to 80, then the eighty-year-old will appear to have a much higher fitness score than he actually should.
Second, mean imputation reduces the variance of the data and increases bias in our data. This leads to a less accurate model and a narrower confidence interval due to a smaller variance."
"What is a confusion matrix? A confusion matrix, also known as an error matrix, is a summarized table used to assess the performance of a classification model. The number of correct and incorrect predictions are summarized with count values and broken down by each class."
"What is Supervised vs Unsupervised learning? Supervised learning involves learning on a labeled dataset where the target variable is known.
Unsupervised learning is used to draw inferences and find patterns from input data without references to labeled outcomes Ã¢ÂÂ thereÃ¢ÂÂs no target variable."
What is ensemble learning? Ensemble learning is a method where multiple learning algorithms are used in conjunction. The purpose of doing so is that it allows you to achieve higher predictive performance than if you were to use an individual algorithm by itself. An example of this is random forests.
"How can you identify outliers? There are a couple of ways to identify outliers:
Z-score/standard deviations: if we know that 99.7% of data in a data set lie within three standard deviations, then we can calculate the size of one standard deviation, multiply it by 3, and identify the data points that are outside of this range. Likewise, we can calculate the z-score of a given point, and if itÃ¢ÂÂs equal to +/- 3, then itÃ¢ÂÂs an outlier.
Note: that there are a few contingencies that need to be considered when using this method; the data must be normally distributed, this is not applicable for small data sets, and the presence of too many outliers can throw off z-score.
Interquartile Range (IQR): IQR, the concept used to build boxplots, can also be used to identify outliers. The IQR is equal to the difference between the 3rd quartile and the 1st quartile. You can then identify if a point is an outlier if it is less than Q1Ã¢ÂÂ1.5*IRQ or greater than Q3 + 1.5*IQR. This comes to approximately 2.698 standard deviations.
Other methods include DBScan clustering, Isolation Forests, and Robust Random Cut Forests."
"What is an inlier? An inlier is a data observation that lies within the rest of the dataset and is unusual or an error. Since it lies in the dataset, it is typically harder to identify than an outlier and requires external data to identify them."
"How can outliers be treated? There are a couple of ways:
Remove outliers if theyÃ¢ÂÂre a garbage value.
You can try a different model. For example, a non-linear model might treat an outlier differently than a linear model.
You can normalize the data to narrow the range.
You can use algorithms that account for outliers, such as random forests."
"How are collaborative filtering and content-based filtering similar? different? In content-based filtering, you use the properties of the objects to find similar products. For example, using content-based filtering, a movie recommender may recommend movies of the same genre or movies directed by the same director.
In collaborative filtering, your behavior is compared to other users and users with similar behavior dictate what is recommended to you. To give a very simple example, if you bought a tv and another user bought a tv as well as a recliner, you would be recommended the recliner as well."
"What is principal component analysis? Explain the sort of problems you would use PCA for.? In its simplest sense, PCA involves project higher dimensional data (eg. 3 dimensions) to a smaller space (eg. 2 dimensions). This results in a lower dimension of data, (2 dimensions instead of 3 dimensions) while keeping all original variables in the model.
PCA is commonly used for compression purposes, to reduce required memory and to speed up the algorithm, as well as for visualization purposes, making it easier to summarize data."
"What is the difference between a validation set and a test set? Generally, the validation set is used to tune the hyperparameters of your model, while the testing set is used to evaluate your final model."
"How can you avoid overfitting your model? For those who donÃ¢ÂÂt know, overfitting is a modeling error when a function fits the data too closely, resulting in high levels of error when new data is introduced to the model.
There are a number of ways that you can prevent overfitting of a model:
Cross-validation: Cross-validation is a technique used to assess how well a model performs on a new independent dataset. The simplest example of cross-validation is when you split your data into two groups: training data and testing data, where you use the training data to build the model and the testing data to test the model.
Regularization: Overfitting occurs when models have higher degree polynomials. Thus, regularization reduces overfitting by penalizing higher degree polynomials.
Reduce the number of features: You can also reduce overfitting by simply reducing the number of input features. You can do this by manually removing features, or you can use a technique, called Principal Component Analysis, which projects higher dimensional data (eg. 3 dimensions) to a smaller space (eg. 2 dimensions).
Ensemble Learning Techniques: Ensemble techniques take many weak learners and converts them into a strong learner through bagging and boosting. Through bagging and boosting, these techniques tend to overfit less than their alternative counterparts."
"What are some of the steps for data wrangling and data cleaning before applying machine learning algorithms? There are many steps that can be taken when data wrangling and data cleaning. Some of the most common steps are listed below:
Data profiling: Almost everyone starts off by getting an understanding of their dataset. More specifically, you can look at the shape of the dataset with .shape and a description of your numerical variables with .describe().
Data visualizations: Sometimes, itÃ¢ÂÂs useful to visualize your data with histograms, boxplots, and scatterplots to better understand the relationships between variables and also to identify potential outliers.
Syntax error: This includes making sure thereÃ¢ÂÂs no white space, making sure letter casing is consistent, and checking for typos. You can check for typos by using .unique() or by using bar graphs.
Standardization or normalization: Depending on the dataset your working with and the machine learning method you decide to use, it may be useful to standardize or normalize your data so that different scales of different variables donÃ¢ÂÂt negatively impact the performance of your model.
Handling null values: There are a number of ways to handle null values including deleting rows with null values altogether, replacing null values with the mean/median/mode, replacing null values with a new category (eg. unknown), predicting the values, or using machine learning models that can deal with null values. Read more here.
Other things include: removing irrelevant data, removing duplicates, and type conversion."
"How should you deal with unbalanced binary classification? There are a number of ways to handle unbalanced binary classification (assuming that you want to identify the minority class):
First, you want to reconsider the metrics that youÃ¢ÂÂd use to evaluate your model. The accuracy of your model might not be the best metric to look at because and IÃ¢ÂÂll use an example to explain why. LetÃ¢ÂÂs say 99 bank withdrawals were not fraudulent and 1 withdrawal was. If your model simply classified every instance as Ã¢ÂÂnot fraudulentÃ¢ÂÂ, it would have an accuracy of 99%! Therefore, you may want to consider using metrics like precision and recall.
Another method to improve unbalanced binary classification is by increasing the cost of misclassifying the minority class. By increasing the penalty of such, the model should classify the minority class more accurately.
Lastly, you can improve the balance of classes by oversampling the minority class or by undersampling the majority class."
What is the difference between precision and recall? Recall attempts to answer Ã¢ÂÂWhat proportion of actual positives was identified correctly?Ã¢ÂÂ Precision attempts to answer Ã¢ÂÂWhat proportion of positive identifications was actually correct?Ã¢ÂÂ
"Why is mean square error a bad measure of model performance? What would you suggest instead? Mean Squared Error (MSE) gives a relatively high weight to large errors Ã¢ÂÂ therefore, MSE tends to put too much emphasis on large deviations. A more robust alternative is MAE (mean absolute deviation)."
"Explain what a false positive and a false negative are. Why is it important these from each other? Provide examples when false positives are more important than false negatives and when false negatives are more important than false positives.? A false positive is an incorrect identification of the presence of a condition when itÃ¢ÂÂs absent.
A false negative is an incorrect identification of the absence of a condition when itÃ¢ÂÂs actually present.
An example of when false negatives are more important than false positives is when screening for cancer. ItÃ¢ÂÂs much worse to say that someone doesnÃ¢ÂÂt have cancer when they do, instead of saying that someone does and later realizing that they donÃ¢ÂÂt.
This is a subjective argument, but false positives can be worse than false negatives from a psychological point of view. For example, a false positive for winning the lottery could be a worse outcome than a false negative because people normally donÃ¢ÂÂt expect to win the lottery anyway."
"What are the feature selection methods used to select the right variables? There are two types of methods for feature selection: filter methods and wrapper methods.
Filter methods include the following:
Linear discrimination analysis
ANOVA
Chi-Square
Wrapper methods include the following:
Forward Selection: We test one feature at a time and keep adding them until we get a good fit
Backward Selection: We test all the features and start removing them to see what works better"
"Briefly explain how a basic neural network works? At its core, a Neural Network is essentially a network of mathematical equations. It takes one or more input variables, and by going through a network of equations, results in one or more output variables. In a neural network, thereÃ¢ÂÂs an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. The input layer consists of one or more feature variables (or input variables or independent variables) denoted as x1, x2, Ã¢ÂÂ¦, xn. The hidden layer consists of one or more hidden nodes or hidden units. Similarly, the output variable consists of one or more output units. Like I said at the beginning, a neural network is nothing more than a network of equations. Each node in a neural network is composed of two functions, a linear function and an activation function. This is where things can get a little confusing, but for now, think of the linear function as some line of best fit. Also, think of the activation function like a light switch, which results in a number between 1 or 0."
"Why is Rectified Linear Unit a good activation function? The Rectified Linear Unit, also known as the ReLU function, is known to be a better activation function than the sigmoid function and the tanh function because it performs gradient descent faster."
"How are weights initialized in a Network? The weights of a neural network MUST be initialized randomly because this is an expectation of stochastic gradient descent.
If you initialized all weights to the same value (i.e. zero or one), then each hidden unit will get exactly the same signal. For example, if all weights are initialized to 0, all hidden units will get zero signal."
"What happens if the learning rate is set too high or too low? If the learning rate is too low, your model will train very slowly as minimal updates are made to the weights through each iteration. Thus, it would take many updates before reaching the minimum point.
If the learning rate is set too high, this causes undesirable divergent behavior to the loss function due to drastic updates in weights, and it may fail to converge."
"What are recurrent neural networks? Recurrent neural networks, also known as RNNs, are a class of neural networks that allow previous outputs to be used as inputs while having hidden states.
They are commonly used to recognize the pattern of sequences in data, including time-series data, stock market data, etcÃ¢ÂÂ¦"
What is the role of the activation function? The purpose of the activation function is to introduce non-linearity into the output of a neuron. The activation function decides whether a neuron should be activated or not by calculating weighted sum and further adding bias with it.
"What is the p-value defined as? The p-value is the probability of obtaining the observed results of a test, assuming that the null hypothesis is correct; a smaller p-value means that there is stronger evidence in favor of the alternative hypothesis."
"What are covariance and correlation? How are they related? Covariance is a quantitative measure of the extent to which the deviation of one variable from its mean matches the deviation of the other from its mean.
Correlation is a measurement of the relationship between two variables. It is the covariance of the two variables, normalized by the variance of each variable."
"What is the law of large numbers? The Law of Large Numbers is a theory that states that as the number of trials increases, the average of the result will become closer to the expected value.
Eg. flipping heads from fair coin 100,000 times should be closer to 0.5 than 100 times."
"What is the Central Limit Theorem? Explain it. Why is it important? The central limit theorem states that the sampling distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution as the sample size gets larger no matter what the shape of the population distribution.
The central limit theorem is important because it is used in hypothesis testing and also to calculate confidence intervals."
"What is the Markov Property? When modeling a stochastic process, one in which an agent makes random decisions over time, such an assumption is referred to as the Markov property."
"What is statistical power? Ã¢ÂÂStatistical powerÃ¢ÂÂ refers to the power of a binary hypothesis, which is the probability that the test rejects the null hypothesis given that the alternative hypothesis is true."
"What are confounding variables? A confounding variable, or a confounder, is a variable that influences both the dependent variable and the independent variable, causing a spurious association, a mathematical relationship in which two or more variables are associated but not causally related."
"How does experimental data contrast with observational data? Observational data comes from observational studies which are when you observe certain variables without intervening and try to determine if there is any correlation.
Experimental data comes from experimental studies (with intervention) which are when you control certain variables and hold them constant to determine if there is any causality."
"Explain selection bias (with regard to a dataset, not variable selection). Why is it important? How can data management procedures such as missing data handling make it worse? Selection bias is the phenomenon of selecting individuals, groups, or data for analysis in such a way that proper randomization is not achieved, ultimately resulting in a sample that is not representative of the population.
Understanding and identifying selection bias is important because it can significantly skew results and provide false insights about a particular population group.
Types of selection bias include:
Sampling bias: a biased sample caused by non-random sampling
Time interval: selecting a specific time frame that supports the desired conclusion. e.g. conducting a sales analysis near Christmas.
Exposure: includes clinical susceptibility bias, protopathic bias, indication bias. 
Data: includes cherry-picking, suppressing evidence, and the fallacy of incomplete evidence.
Attrition: attrition bias is similar to survivorship bias, where only those that Ã¢ÂÂsurvivedÃ¢ÂÂ a long process are included in an analysis, or failure bias, where those that Ã¢ÂÂfailedÃ¢ÂÂ are only included
Observer selection: related to the Anthropic principle, which is a philosophical consideration that any data we collect about the universe is filtered by the fact that, in order for it to be observable, it must be compatible with the conscious and sapient life that observes it.
Handling missing data can make selection bias worse because different methods impact the data in different ways. For example, if you replace null values with the mean of the data, you adding bias in the sense that youÃ¢ÂÂre assuming that the data is not as spread out as it might actually be."
"What is the difference between interpolation and extrapolation and why does it matter? Interpolation is when a prediction is made using inputs that lie within the set of observed values.
Extrapolation is when a prediction is made using an input thatÃ¢ÂÂs outside of the set of observed values.
ItÃ¢ÂÂs important to know the distinction because interpolations are generally more accurate than extrapolations."
Give an example where the median is a better measure than the mean? When there are a number of outliers that positively or negatively skew the data.
"What is survivorship bias? The phenomenon where only those that Ã¢ÂÂsurvivedÃ¢ÂÂ a long process are included or excluded in an analysis, thus creating a biased sample.
A great example provided by Sreenivasan Chandrasekar is the following:
Ã¢ÂÂWe enroll for gym membership and attend for a few days. We see the same faces of many people who are fit, motivated and exercising everyday whenever we go to gym. After a few days we become depressed why we arenÃ¢ÂÂt able to stick to our schedule and motivation more than a week when most of the people who we saw at gym could. What we didnÃ¢ÂÂt see was that many of the people who had enrolled for gym membership had also stopped turning up for gym just after a week and we didnÃ¢ÂÂt see them.Ã¢ÂÂ"
"What is root cause analysis? How can you identify a cause vs. a correlation? Give examples.? Root cause analysis is a method of problem-solving used for identifying the root cause(s) of a problem
You can identify a correlation using simple data analyses. You can then identify causation by conducting an experiment so that all other variables are isolated (ideally)."
"Give me 3 types of statistical biases and explain each of them with an example.? Sampling bias refers to a biased sample caused by non-random sampling.
To give an example, imagine that there are 10 people in a room and you ask if they prefer grapes or bananas. If you only surveyed the three females and concluded that the majority of people like grapes, youÃ¢ÂÂd have demonstrated sampling bias. Confirmation bias: the tendency to favour information that confirms oneÃ¢ÂÂs beliefs.
Survivorship bias: the phenomenon where only those that Ã¢ÂÂsurvivedÃ¢ÂÂ a long process are included or excluded in an analysis, thus creating a biased sample."
"Explain what a long-tailed distribution is and provide three examples of relevant phenomena that have long tails. Why are they important in classification and regression problems? A long-tailed distribution is a type of heavy-tailed distribution that has a tail (or tails) that drop off gradually and asymptotically.
3 practical examples include the power law, the Pareto principle (more commonly known as the 80Ã¢ÂÂ20 rule), and product sales (i.e. best selling products vs others).
ItÃ¢ÂÂs important to be mindful of long-tailed distributions in classification and regression problems because the least frequently occurring values make up the majority of the population. This can ultimately change the way that you deal with outliers, and it also conflicts with some machine learning techniques with the assumption that the data is normally distributed."
"What is A/B testing? When is it used in practice? A/B Testing is a statistical hypothesis testing meant for a randomized experiment with two variables, A and B. It is commonly used in product development and marketing."
"How do you control for biases? There are many things that you can do to control and minimize bias. Two common things include randomization, where participants are assigned by chance, and random sampling, sampling in which each member has an equal probability of being chosen."
"Give examples of data that does not have a Gaussian distribution, nor log-normal.? Any type of categorical data wonÃ¢ÂÂt have a gaussian distribution or lognormal distribution.
Exponential distributions Ã¢ÂÂ eg. the amount of time that a car battery lasts or the amount of time until an earthquake occurs."
"How do you assess the statistical significance of an insight? You would perform hypothesis testing to determine statistical significance. First, you would state the null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis. Second, you would calculate the p-value, the probability of obtaining the observed results of a test assuming that the null hypothesis is true. Last, you would set the level of the significance (alpha) and if the p-value is less than the alpha, you would reject the null Ã¢ÂÂ in other words, the result is statistically significant."
"The homicide rate in Scotland fell last year to 99 from 115 the year before. Is this reported change really noteworthy? Since this is a Poisson distribution question, mean = lambda = variance, which also means that standard deviation = square root of the mean.
a 95% confidence interval implies a z score of 1.96
one standard deviation = sqrt(115) = 10.724
Therefore the confidence interval = 115+/- 21.45 = [93.55, 136.45]. Since 99 is within this confidence interval, we can assume that this change is not very noteworthy."
"What is the difference between a boxplot and a histogram? While boxplots and histograms are visualizations used to show the distribution of the data, they communicate information differently.
Histograms are bar charts that show the frequency of a numerical variableÃ¢ÂÂs values and are used to approximate the probability distribution of the given variable. It allows you to quickly understand the shape of the distribution, the variation, and potential outliers.
Boxplots communicate different aspects of the distribution of data. While you canÃ¢ÂÂt see the shape of the distribution through a box plot, you can gather other information like the quartiles, the range, and outliers. Boxplots are especially useful when you want to compare multiple charts at the same time because they take up less space than histograms."
"What is the meaning of ACF and PACF? To understand ACF and PACF, you first need to know what autocorrelation or serial correlation is. Autocorrelation looks at the degree of similarity between a given time series and a lagged version of itself.
Therefore, the autocorrelation function (ACF) is a tool that is used to find patterns in the data, specifically in terms of correlations between points separated by various time lags. For example, ACF(0)=1 means that all data points are perfectly correlated with themselves and ACF(1)=0.9 means that the correlation between one point and the next one is 0.9.
The PACF is short for partial autocorrelation function. Quoting a text from StackExchange, Ã¢ÂÂIt can be thought as the correlation between two points that are separated by some number of periods n, but with the effect of the intervening correlations removed.Ã¢ÂÂ For example. If T1 is directly correlated with T2 and T2 is directly correlated with T3, it would appear that T1 is correlated with T3. PACF will remove the intervening correlation with T2."
"How would you design an experiment for a new feature weÃ¢ÂÂre thinking about. What metrics would matter? I would conduct an A/B test to determine if the introduction of a new feature results in a statistically significant improvement in a given metric that we care about. The metric(s) chosen depends on the goal of the feature. For example, a feature may be introduced to increase conversion rates, or web traffic, or retention rates.
First I would formulate my null hypothesis (feature X will not improve metric A) and my alternative hypothesis (feature X will improve metric A).
Next, I would create my control and test group through random sampling. Because the t-test inherently considers the sample size, IÃ¢ÂÂm not going to specify a necessary sample size, although the larger the better.
Once I collect my data, depending on the characteristics of my data, IÃ¢ÂÂd then conduct a t-test, WelchÃ¢ÂÂs t-test, chi-squared test, or a Bayesian A/B test to determine whether the differences between my control and test group are statistically significant."
"How do you prove that males are on average taller than females by knowing just gender height? You can use hypothesis testing to prove that males are taller on average than females.
The null hypothesis would state that males and females are the same height on average, while the alternative hypothesis would state that the average height of males is greater than the average height of females.
Then you would collect a random sample of heights of males and females and use a t-test to determine if you reject the null or not."
"If a PM says that they want to double the number of ads in Newsfeed, how would you figure out if this is a good idea or not? You can perform an A/B test by splitting the users into two groups: a control group with the normal number of ads and a test group with double the number of ads. Then you would choose the metric to define what a Ã¢ÂÂgood ideaÃ¢ÂÂ is. For example, we can say that the null hypothesis is that doubling the number of ads will reduce the time spent on Facebook and the alternative hypothesis is that doubling the number of ads wonÃ¢ÂÂt have any impact on the time spent on Facebook. However, you can choose a different metric like the number of active users or the churn rate. Then you would conduct the test and determine the statistical significance of the test to reject or not reject the null."
"How can you tell if a given coin is biased? This isnÃ¢ÂÂt a trick question. The answer is simply to perform a hypothesis test:
The null hypothesis is that the coin is not biased and the probability of flipping heads should equal 50% (p=0.5). The alternative hypothesis is that the coin is biased and p != 0.5.
Flip the coin 500 times.
Calculate Z-score (if the sample is less than 30, you would calculate the t-statistics).
Compare against alpha (two-tailed test so 0.05/2 = 0.025).
If p-value > alpha, the null is not rejected and the coin is not biased.
If p-value < alpha, the null is rejected and the coin is biased."
"How to define/select metrics? There isnÃ¢ÂÂt a one-size-fits-all metric. The metric(s) chosen to evaluate a machine learning model depends on various factors:
Is it a regression or classification task?
What is the business objective? Eg. precision vs recall
What is the distribution of the target variable?
There are a number of metrics that can be used, including adjusted r-squared, MAE, MSE, accuracy, recall, precision, f1 score, and the list goes on."
"Why is dimension reduction important? Dimensionality reduction is the process of reducing the number of features in a dataset. This is important mainly in the case when you want to reduce variance in your model (overfitting).
Wikipedia states four advantages of dimensionality reduction:
It reduces the time and storage space required
Removal of multi-collinearity improves the interpretation of the parameters of the machine learning model
It becomes easier to visualize the data when reduced to very low dimensions such as 2D or 3D
It avoids the curse of dimensionality"
"Why is Naive Bayes so bad? How would you improve a spam detection algorithm that uses naive Bayes? One major drawback of Naive Bayes is that it holds a strong assumption in that the features are assumed to be uncorrelated with one another, which typically is never the case.
One way to improve such an algorithm that uses Naive Bayes is by decorrelating the features so that the assumption holds true."
"How to check if the regression model fits the data well? There are a couple of metrics that you can use:
R-squared/Adjusted R-squared: Relative measure of fit. This was explained in a previous answer
F1 Score: Evaluates the null hypothesis that all regression coefficients are equal to zero vs the alternative hypothesis that at least one doesnÃ¢ÂÂt equal zero
RMSE: Absolute measure of fit."
"What is a decision tree? Decision trees are a popular model, used in operations research, strategic planning, and machine learning. Each square above is called a node, and the more nodes you have, the more accurate your decision tree will be (generally). The last nodes of the decision tree, where a decision is made, are called the leaves of the tree. Decision trees are intuitive and easy to build but fall short when it comes to accuracy."
"What is a kernel? Explain the kernel trick? A kernel is a way of computing the dot product of two vectors Ã°ÂÂÂ±x and Ã°ÂÂÂ²y in some (possibly very high dimensional) feature space, which is why kernel functions are sometimes called Ã¢ÂÂgeneralized dot productÃ¢ÂÂ. The kernel trick is a method of using a linear classifier to solve a non-linear problem by transforming linearly inseparable data to linearly separable ones in a higher dimension."
"Is it beneficial to perform dimensionality reduction before fitting an SVM? Why or why not? When the number of features is greater than the number of observations, then performing dimensionality reduction will generally improve the SVM."
"What is overfitting? Overfitting is an error where the model Ã¢ÂÂfitsÃ¢ÂÂ the data too well, resulting in a model with high variance and low bias. As a consequence, an overfit model will inaccurately predict new data points even though it has a high accuracy on the training data."
"What is boosting? Boosting is an ensemble method to improve a model by reducing its bias and variance, ultimately converting weak learners to strong learners. The general idea is to train a weak learner and sequentially iterate and improve the model by learning from the previous learner."
"Difference between convex and non-convex cost function; what does it mean when a cost function is non-convex? A convex function is one where a line drawn between any two points on the graph lies on or above the graph. It has one minimum.
A non-convex function is one where a line drawn between any two points on the graph may intersect other points on the graph. It characterized as Ã¢ÂÂwavyÃ¢ÂÂ.
When a cost function is non-convex, it means that thereÃ¢ÂÂs a likelihood that the function may find local minima instead of the global minimum, which is typically undesired in machine learning models from an optimization perspective."
"What is an outlier? Explain how you might screen for outliers and what would you do if you found them in your dataset. Also, explain what an inlier is and how you might screen for them and what would you do if you found them in your dataset.? An outlier is a data point that differs significantly from other observations.
Depending on the cause of the outlier, they can be bad from a machine learning perspective because they can worsen the accuracy of a model. If the outlier is caused by a measurement error, itÃ¢ÂÂs important to remove them from the dataset. There are a couple of ways to identify outliers:
Z-score/standard deviations: if we know that 99.7% of data in a data set lie within three standard deviations, then we can calculate the size of one standard deviation, multiply it by 3, and identify the data points that are outside of this range. Likewise, we can calculate the z-score of a given point, and if itÃ¢ÂÂs equal to +/- 3, then itÃ¢ÂÂs an outlier.
Note: that there are a few contingencies that need to be considered when using this method; the data must be normally distributed, this is not applicable for small data sets, and the presence of too many outliers can throw off z-score. Interquartile Range (IQR): IQR, the concept used to build boxplots, can also be used to identify outliers. The IQR is equal to the difference between the 3rd quartile and the 1st quartile. You can then identify if a point is an outlier if it is less than Q1Ã¢ÂÂ1.5*IRQ or greater than Q3 + 1.5*IQR. This comes to approximately 2.698 standard deviations. Other methods include DBScan clustering, Isolation Forests, and Robust Random Cut Forests.
An inlier is a data observation that lies within the rest of the dataset and is unusual or an error. Since it lies in the dataset, it is typically harder to identify than an outlier and requires external data to identify them. Should you identify any inliers, you can simply remove them from the dataset to address them."
"How do you handle missing data? What imputation techniques do you recommend? There are several ways to handle missing data:
Delete rows with missing data
Mean/Median/Mode imputation
Assigning a unique value
Predicting the missing values
Using an algorithm which supports missing values, like random forests
The best method is to delete rows with missing data as it ensures that no bias or variance is added or removed, and ultimately results in a robust and accurate model. However, this is only recommended if thereÃ¢ÂÂs a lot of data to start with and the percentage of missing values is low."
"You are compiling a report for user content uploaded every month and notice a spike in uploads in October. In particular, a spike in picture uploads. What might you think is the cause of this, and how would you test it? There are a number of potential reasons for a spike in photo uploads:
A new feature may have been implemented in October which involves uploading photos and gained a lot of traction by users. For example, a feature that gives the ability to create photo albums.
Similarly, itÃ¢ÂÂs possible that the process of uploading photos before was not intuitive and was improved in the month of October.
There may have been a viral social media movement that involved uploading photos that lasted for all of October. Eg. Movember but something more scalable.
ItÃ¢ÂÂs possible that the spike is due to people posting pictures of themselves in costumes for Halloween.
The method of testing depends on the cause of the spike, but you would conduct hypothesis testing to determine if the inferred cause is the actual cause."
How do you calculate the needed sample size? You can use the margin of error (ME) formula to determine the desired sample size.
"You are running for office and your pollster polled hundred people. Sixty of them claimed they will vote for you. Can you relax? Assume that thereÃ¢ÂÂs only you and one other opponent.
Also, assume that we want a 95% confidence interval. This gives us a z-score of 1.96. p-hat = 60/100 = 0.6
z* = 1.96
n = 100
This gives us a confidence interval of [50.4,69.6]. Therefore, given a confidence interval of 95%, if you are okay with the worst scenario of tying then you can relax. Otherwise, you cannot relax until you got 61 out of 100 to claim yes."
"You are given a train data set having 1000 columns and 1 million rows. The data set is based on a classification problem. Your manager has asked you to reduce the dimension of this data so that model computation time can be reduced. Your machine has memory constraints. What would you do? (You are free to make practical assumptions.)? Since we have lower RAM, we should close all other applications in our machine, including the web browser, so that most of the memory can be put to use.
We can randomly sample the data set. This means, we can create a smaller data set, letÃ¢ÂÂs say, having 1000 variables and 300000 rows and do the computations.
To reduce dimensionality, we can separate the numerical and categorical variables and remove the correlated variables. For numerical variables, weÃ¢ÂÂll use correlation. For categorical variables, weÃ¢ÂÂll use chi-square test.
Also, we can use PCA and pick the components which can explain the maximum variance in the data set.
Using online learning algorithms like Vowpal Wabbit (available in Python) is a possible option.
Building a linear model using Stochastic Gradient Descent is also helpful.
We can also apply our business understanding to estimate which all predictors can impact the response variable. But, this is an intuitive approach, failing to identify useful predictors might result in significant loss of information."
"Is rotation necessary in PCA? If yes, Why? What will happen if you donÃ¢ÂÂt rotate the components? Yes, rotation (orthogonal) is necessary because it maximizes the difference between variance captured by the component. This makes the components easier to interpret. Not to forget, thatÃ¢ÂÂs the motive of doing PCA where, we aim to select fewer components (than features) which can explain the maximum variance in the data set. By doing rotation, the relative location of the components doesnÃ¢ÂÂt change, it only changes the actual coordinates of the points.

If we donÃ¢ÂÂt rotate the components, the effect of PCA will diminish and weÃ¢ÂÂll have to select more number of components to explain variance in the data set."
"You are given a data set. The data set has missing values which spread along 1 standard deviation from the median. What percentage of data would remain unaffected? Why? This question has enough hints for you to start thinking! Since, the data is spread across median, letÃ¢ÂÂs assume itÃ¢ÂÂs a normal distribution. We know, in a normal distribution, ~68% of the data lies in 1 standard deviation from mean (or mode, median), which leaves ~32% of the data unaffected. Therefore, ~32% of the data would remain unaffected by missing values."
"You are given a data set on cancer detection. YouÃ¢ÂÂve build a classification model and achieved an accuracy of 96%. Why shouldnÃ¢ÂÂt you be happy with your model performance? What can you do about it? If you have worked on enough data sets, you should deduce that cancer detection results in imbalanced data. In an imbalanced data set, accuracy should not be used as a measure of performance because 96% (as given) might only be predicting majority class correctly, but our class of interest is minority class (4%) which is the people who actually got diagnosed with cancer. Hence, in order to evaluate model performance, we should use Sensitivity (True Positive Rate), Specificity (True Negative Rate), F measure to determine class wise performance of the classifier. If the minority class performance is found to to be poor, we can undertake the following steps:               We can use undersampling, oversampling or SMOTE to make the data balanced.
We can alter the prediction threshold value by doing probability caliberation and finding a optimal threshold using AUC-ROC curve.
We can assign weight to classes such that the minority classes gets larger weight.
We can also use anomaly detection."
"Why is naive Bayes so Ã¢ÂÂnaiveÃ¢ÂÂ ? naive Bayes is so Ã¢ÂÂnaiveÃ¢ÂÂ because it assumes that all of the features in a data set are equally important and independent. As we know, these assumption are rarely true in real world scenario."
"Explain prior probability, likelihood and marginal likelihood in context of Naive Bayes algorithm? Prior probability is nothing but, the proportion of dependent (binary) variable in the data set. It is the closest guess you can make about a class, without any further information. For example: In a data set, the dependent variable is binary (1 and 0). The proportion of 1 (spam) is 70% and 0 (not spam) is 30%. Hence, we can estimate that there are 70% chances that any new email would be classified as spam.

Likelihood is the probability of classifying a given observation as 1 in presence of some other variable. For example: The probability that the word Ã¢ÂÂFREEÃ¢ÂÂ is used in previous spam message is likelihood. Marginal likelihood is, the probability that the word Ã¢ÂÂFREEÃ¢ÂÂ is used in any message."
"You are working on a time series data set. You manager has asked you to build a high accuracy model. You start with the decision tree algorithm, since you know it works fairly well on all kinds of data. Later, you tried a time series regression model and got higher accuracy than decision tree model. Can this happen? Why? Time series data is known to posses linearity. On the other hand, a decision tree algorithm is known to work best to detect non Ã¢ÂÂ linear interactions. The reason why decision tree failed to provide robust predictions because it couldnÃ¢ÂÂt map the linear relationship as good as a regression model did. Therefore, we learned that, a linear regression model can provide robust prediction given the data set satisfies its linearity assumptions."
"You are assigned a new project which involves helping a food delivery company save more money. The problem is, companyÃ¢ÂÂs delivery team arenÃ¢ÂÂt able to deliver food on time. As a result, their customers get unhappy. And, to keep them happy, they end up delivering food for free. Which machine learning algorithm can save them? You might have started hopping through the list of ML algorithms in your mind. But, wait! Such questions are asked to test your machine learning fundamentals.

This is not a machine learning problem. This is a route optimization problem. A machine learning problem consist of three things:

There exist a pattern.
You cannot solve it mathematically (even by writing exponential equations).
You have data on it.
Always look for these three factors to decide if machine learning is a tool to solve a particular problem."
"You came to know that your model is suffering from low bias and high variance. Which algorithm should you use to tackle it? Why? Low bias occurs when the modelÃ¢ÂÂs predicted values are near to actual values. In other words, the model becomes flexible enough to mimic the training data distribution. While it sounds like great achievement, but not to forget, a flexible model has no generalization capabilities. It means, when this model is tested on an unseen data, it gives disappointing results.

In such situations, we can use bagging algorithm (like random forest) to tackle high variance problem. Bagging algorithms divides a data set into subsets made with repeated randomized sampling. Then, these samples are used to generate a set of models using a single learning algorithm. Later, the model predictions are combined using voting (classification) or averaging (regression).

Also, to combat high variance, we can:

Use regularization technique, where higher model coefficients get penalized, hence lowering model complexity.
Use top n features from variable importance chart. May be, with all the variable in the data set, the algorithm is having difficulty in finding the meaningful signal."
"You are given a data set. The data set contains many variables, some of which are highly correlated and you know about it. Your manager has asked you to run PCA. Would you remove correlated variables first? Why? Chances are, you might be tempted to say No, but that would be incorrect. Discarding correlated variables have a substantial effect on PCA because, in presence of correlated variables, the variance explained by a particular component gets inflated.

For example: You have 3 variables in a data set, of which 2 are correlated. If you run PCA on this data set, the first principal component would exhibit twice the variance than it would exhibit with uncorrelated variables. Also, adding correlated variables lets PCA put more importance on those variable, which is misleading."
"After spending several hours, you are now anxious to build a high accuracy model. As a result, you build 5 GBM models, thinking a boosting algorithm would do the magic. Unfortunately, neither of models could perform better than benchmark score. Finally, you decided to combine those models. Though, ensembled models are known to return high accuracy, but you are unfortunate. Where did you miss? As we know, ensemble learners are based on the idea of combining weak learners to create strong learners. But, these learners provide superior result when the combined models are uncorrelated. Since, we have used 5 GBM models and got no accuracy improvement, suggests that the models are correlated. The problem with correlated models is, all the models provide same information.

For example: If model 1 has classified User1122 as 1, there are high chances model 2 and model 3 would have done the same, even if its actual value is 0. Therefore, ensemble learners are built on the premise of combining weak uncorrelated models to obtain better predictions."
"How is kNN different from kmeans clustering? DonÃ¢ÂÂt get mislead by Ã¢ÂÂkÃ¢ÂÂ in their names. You should know that the fundamental difference between both these algorithms is, kmeans is unsupervised in nature and kNN is supervised in nature. kmeans is a clustering algorithm. kNN is a classification (or regression) algorithm.

kmeans algorithm partitions a data set into clusters such that a cluster formed is homogeneous and the points in each cluster are close to each other. The algorithm tries to maintain enough separability between these clusters. Due to unsupervised nature, the clusters have no labels.

kNN algorithm tries to classify an unlabeled observation based on its k (can be any number ) surrounding neighbors. It is also known as lazy learner because it involves minimal training of model. Hence, it doesnÃ¢ÂÂt use training data to make generalization on unseen data set."
"How is True Positive Rate and Recall related? Write the equation.? True Positive Rate = Recall. Yes, they are equal having the formula (TP/TP + FN)."
"You have built a multiple regression model. Your model RÃÂ² isnÃ¢ÂÂt as good as you wanted. For improvement, your remove the intercept term, your model RÃÂ² becomes 0.8 from 0.3. Is it possible? How? Yes, it is possible. We need to understand the significance of intercept term in a regression model. The intercept term shows model prediction without any independent variable i.e. mean prediction. The formula of RÃÂ² = 1 Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ(y Ã¢ÂÂ yÃÂ´)ÃÂ²/Ã¢ÂÂ(y Ã¢ÂÂ ymean)ÃÂ² where yÃÂ´ is predicted value.

When intercept term is present, RÃÂ² value evaluates your model wrt. to the mean model. In absence of intercept term (ymean), the model can make no such evaluation, with large denominator, Ã¢ÂÂ(y - yÃÂ´)ÃÂ²/Ã¢ÂÂ(y)ÃÂ² equationÃ¢ÂÂs value becomes smaller than actual, resulting in higher RÃÂ²."
"After analyzing the model, your manager has informed that your regression model is suffering from multicollinearity. How would you check if heÃ¢ÂÂs true? Without losing any information, can you still build a better model? To check multicollinearity, we can create a correlation matrix to identify & remove variables having correlation above 75% (deciding a threshold is subjective). In addition, we can use calculate VIF (variance inflation factor) to check the presence of multicollinearity. VIF value = 10 implies serious multicollinearity. Also, we can use tolerance as an indicator of multicollinearity.

But, removing correlated variables might lead to loss of information. In order to retain those variables, we can use penalized regression models like ridge or lasso regression. Also, we can add some random noise in correlated variable so that the variables become different from each other. But, adding noise might affect the prediction accuracy, hence this approach should be carefully used."
"When is Ridge regression favorable over Lasso regression? Conceptually, we can say, lasso regression (L1) does both variable selection and parameter shrinkage, whereas Ridge regression only does parameter shrinkage and end up including all the coefficients in the model. In presence of correlated variables, ridge regression might be the preferred choice. Also, ridge regression works best in situations where the least square estimates have higher variance. Therefore, it depends on our model objective."
"Rise in global average temperature led to decrease in number of pirates around the world. Does that mean that decrease in number of pirates caused the climate change? After reading this question, you should have understood that this is a classic case of Ã¢ÂÂcausation and correlationÃ¢ÂÂ. No, we canÃ¢ÂÂt conclude that decrease in number of pirates caused the climate change because there might be other factors (lurking or confounding variables) influencing this phenomenon.

Therefore, there might be a correlation between global average temperature and number of pirates, but based on this information we canÃ¢ÂÂt say that pirated died because of rise in global average temperature.
"
"While working on a data set, how do you select important variables? Explain your methods.? Following are the methods of variable selection you can use:

Remove the correlated variables prior to selecting important variables
Use linear regression and select variables based on p values
Use Forward Selection, Backward Selection, Stepwise Selection
Use Random Forest, Xgboost and plot variable importance chart
Use Lasso Regression
Measure information gain for the available set of features and select top n features accordingly."
"What is the difference between covariance and correlation? Correlation is the standardized form of covariance.

Covariances are difficult to compare. For example: if we calculate the covariances of salary ($) and age (years), weÃ¢ÂÂll get different covariances which canÃ¢ÂÂt be compared because of having unequal scales. To combat such situation, we calculate correlation to get a value between -1 and 1, irrespective of their respective scale."
"Is it possible capture the correlation between continuous and categorical variable? If yes, how? Yes, we can use ANCOVA (analysis of covariance) technique to capture association between continuous and categorical variables."
"Both being tree based algorithm, how is random forest different from Gradient boosting algorithm (GBM)? The fundamental difference is, random forest uses bagging technique to make predictions. GBM uses boosting techniques to make predictions.

In bagging technique, a data set is divided into n samples using randomized sampling. Then, using a single learning algorithm a model is build on all samples. Later, the resultant predictions are combined using voting or averaging. Bagging is done in parallel. In boosting, after the first round of predictions, the algorithm weighs misclassified predictions higher, such that they can be corrected in the succeeding round. This sequential process of giving higher weights to misclassified predictions continue until a stopping criterion is reached.

Random forest improves model accuracy by reducing variance (mainly). The trees grown are uncorrelated to maximize the decrease in variance. On the other hand, GBM improves accuracy my reducing both bias and variance in a model."
"Running a binary classification tree algorithm is the easy part. Do you know how does a tree splitting takes place i.e. how does the tree decide which variable to split at the root node and succeeding nodes? A classification trees makes decision based on Gini Index and Node Entropy. In simple words, the tree algorithm find the best possible feature which can divide the data set into purest possible children nodes."
"YouÃ¢ÂÂve built a random forest model with 10000 trees. You got delighted after getting training error as 0.00. But, the validation error is 34.23. What is going on? HavenÃ¢ÂÂt you trained your model perfectly? The model has overfitted. Training error 0.00 means the classifier has mimiced the training data patterns to an extent, that they are not available in the unseen data. Hence, when this classifier was run on unseen sample, it couldnÃ¢ÂÂt find those patterns and returned prediction with higher error. In random forest, it happens when we use larger number of trees than necessary. Hence, to avoid these situation, we should tune number of trees using cross validation.
"
"YouÃ¢ÂÂve got a data set to work having p (no. of variable) > n (no. of observation). Why is OLS as bad option to work with? Which techniques would be best to use? Why? In such high dimensional data sets, we canÃ¢ÂÂt use classical regression techniques, since their assumptions tend to fail. When p > n, we can no longer calculate a unique least square coefficient estimate, the variances become infinite, so OLS cannot be used at all.

To combat this situation, we can use penalized regression methods like lasso, LARS, ridge which can shrink the coefficients to reduce variance. Precisely, ridge regression works best in situations where the least square estimates have higher variance.

Among other methods include subset regression, forward stepwise regression."
"What is convex hull ? (Hint: Think SVM)? In case of linearly separable data, convex hull represents the outer boundaries of the two group of data points. Once convex hull is created, we get maximum margin hyperplane (MMH) as a perpendicular bisector between two convex hulls. MMH is the line which attempts to create greatest separation between two groups."
"We know that one hot encoding increasing the dimensionality of a data set. But, label encoding doesnÃ¢ÂÂt. How ? DonÃ¢ÂÂt get baffled at this question. ItÃ¢ÂÂs a simple question asking the difference between the two.

Using one hot encoding, the dimensionality (a.k.a features) in a data set get increased because it creates a new variable for each level present in categorical variables. For example: letÃ¢ÂÂs say we have a variable Ã¢ÂÂcolorÃ¢ÂÂ. The variable has 3 levels namely Red, Blue and Green. One hot encoding Ã¢ÂÂcolorÃ¢ÂÂ variable will generate three new variables as Color.Red, Color.Blue and Color.Green containing 0 and 1 value.

In label encoding, the levels of a categorical variables gets encoded as 0 and 1, so no new variable is created. Label encoding is majorly used for binary variables."
"What cross validation technique would you use on time series data set? Is it k-fold or LOOCV? Neither.

In time series problem, k fold can be troublesome because there might be some pattern in year 4 or 5 which is not in year 3. Resampling the data set will separate these trends, and we might end up validation on past years, which is incorrect. Instead, we can use forward chaining strategy with 5 fold as shown below:

fold 1 : training [1], test [2]
fold 2 : training [1 2], test [3]
fold 3 : training [1 2 3], test [4]
fold 4 : training [1 2 3 4], test [5]
fold 5 : training [1 2 3 4 5], test [6]
where 1,2,3,4,5,6 represents Ã¢ÂÂyearÃ¢ÂÂ.
"
"You are given a data set consisting of variables having more than 30% missing values? LetÃ¢ÂÂs say, out of 50 variables, 8 variables have missing values higher than 30%. How will you deal with them? We can deal with them in the following ways:

Assign a unique category to missing values, who knows the missing values might decipher some trend
We can remove them blatantly.
Or, we can sensibly check their distribution with the target variable, and if found any pattern weÃ¢ÂÂll keep those missing values and assign them a new category while removing others."
"Ã¢ÂÂPeople who bought this, also boughtÃ¢ÂÂ¦Ã¢ÂÂ recommendations seen on amazon is a result of which algorithm? The basic idea for this kind of recommendation engine comes from collaborative filtering.

Collaborative Filtering algorithm considers Ã¢ÂÂUser BehaviorÃ¢ÂÂ for recommending items. They exploit behavior of other users and items in terms of transaction history, ratings, selection and purchase information. Other users behaviour and preferences over the items are used to recommend items to the new users. In this case, features of the items are not known."
"What do you understand by Type I vs Type II error ? Type I error is committed when the null hypothesis is true and we reject it, also known as a Ã¢ÂÂFalse PositiveÃ¢ÂÂ. Type II error is committed when the null hypothesis is false and we accept it, also known as Ã¢ÂÂFalse NegativeÃ¢ÂÂ.

In the context of confusion matrix, we can say Type I error occurs when we classify a value as positive (1) when it is actually negative (0). Type II error occurs when we classify a value as negative (0) when it is actually positive(1)."
"You are working on a classification problem. For validation purposes, youÃ¢ÂÂve randomly sampled the training data set into train and validation. You are confident that your model will work incredibly well on unseen data since your validation accuracy is high. However, you get shocked after getting poor test accuracy. What went wrong? In case of classification problem, we should always use stratified sampling instead of random sampling. A random sampling doesnÃ¢ÂÂt takes into consideration the proportion of target classes. On the contrary, stratified sampling helps to maintain the distribution of target variable in the resultant distributed samples also."
"You have been asked to evaluate a regression model based on RÃÂ², adjusted RÃÂ² and tolerance. What will be your criteria? Tolerance (1 / VIF) is used as an indicator of multicollinearity. It is an indicator of percent of variance in a predictor which cannot be accounted by other predictors. Large values of tolerance is desirable.

We will consider adjusted RÃÂ² as opposed to RÃÂ² to evaluate model fit because RÃÂ² increases irrespective of improvement in prediction accuracy as we add more variables. But, adjusted RÃÂ² would only increase if an additional variable improves the accuracy of model, otherwise stays same. It is difficult to commit a general threshold value for adjusted RÃÂ² because it varies between data sets. For example: a gene mutation data set might result in lower adjusted RÃÂ² and still provide fairly good predictions, as compared to a stock market data where lower adjusted RÃÂ² implies that model is not good."
"In k-means or kNN, we use euclidean distance to calculate the distance between nearest neighbors. Why not manhattan distance ? We donÃ¢ÂÂt use manhattan distance because it calculates distance horizontally or vertically only. It has dimension restrictions. On the other hand, euclidean metric can be used in any space to calculate distance. Since, the data points can be present in any dimension, euclidean distance is a more viable option."
"Explain machine learning to me like a 5 year old.? ItÃ¢ÂÂs simple. ItÃ¢ÂÂs just like how babies learn to walk. Every time they fall down, they learn (unconsciously) & realize that their legs should be straight and not in a bend position. The next time they fall down, they feel pain. They cry. But, they learn Ã¢ÂÂnot to stand like that againÃ¢ÂÂ. In order to avoid that pain, they try harder. To succeed, they even seek support from the door or wall or anything near them, which helps them stand firm.

This is how a machine works & develops intuition from its environment."
"I know that a linear regression model is generally evaluated using Adjusted RÃÂ² or F value. How would you evaluate a logistic regression model? Since logistic regression is used to predict probabilities, we can use AUC-ROC curve along with confusion matrix to determine its performance.
Also, the analogous metric of adjusted RÃÂ² in logistic regression is AIC. AIC is the measure of fit which penalizes model for the number of model coefficients. Therefore, we always prefer model with minimum AIC value.
Null Deviance indicates the response predicted by a model with nothing but an intercept. Lower the value, better the model. Residual deviance indicates the response predicted by a model on adding independent variables. Lower the value, better the model."
"Considering the long list of machine learning algorithm, given a data set, how do you decide which one to use? You should say, the choice of machine learning algorithm solely depends of the type of data. If you are given a data set which is exhibits linearity, then linear regression would be the best algorithm to use. If you given to work on images, audios, then neural network would help you to build a robust model.

If the data comprises of non linear interactions, then a boosting or bagging algorithm should be the choice. If the business requirement is to build a model which can be deployed, then weÃ¢ÂÂll use regression or a decision tree model (easy to interpret and explain) instead of black box algorithms like SVM, GBM etc.

In short, there is no one master algorithm for all situations. We must be scrupulous enough to understand which algorithm to use."
"Do you suggest that treating a categorical variable as continuous variable would result in a better predictive model? For better predictions, categorical variable can be considered as a continuous variable only when the variable is ordinal in nature."
"When does regularization becomes necessary in Machine Learning? Regularization becomes necessary when the model begins to ovefit / underfit. This technique introduces a cost term for bringing in more features with the objective function. Hence, it tries to push the coefficients for many variables to zero and hence reduce cost term. This helps to reduce model complexity so that the model can become better at predicting (generalizing).
"
"OLS is to linear regression. Maximum likelihood is to logistic regression. Explain the statement.? OLS and Maximum likelihood are the methods used by the respective regression methods to approximate the unknown parameter (coefficient) value. In simple words,

Ordinary least square(OLS) is a method used in linear regression which approximates the parameters resulting in minimum distance between actual and predicted values. Maximum Likelihood helps in choosing the the values of parameters which maximizes the likelihood that the parameters are most likely to produce observed data."
How is logistic regression done? Logistic regression measures the relationship between the dependent variable (our label of what we want to predict) and one or more independent variables (our features) by estimating probability using its underlying logistic function (sigmoid).
"Explain the steps in making a decision tree.? Take the entire data set as input
Calculate entropy of the target variable, as well as the predictor attributes
Calculate your information gain of all attributes (we gain information on sorting different objects from each other)
Choose the attribute with the highest information gain as the root node 
Repeat the same procedure on every branch until the decision node of each branch is finalized"
"How do you build a random forest model? A random forest is built up of a number of decision trees. If you split the data into different packages and make a decision tree in each of the different groups of data, the random forest brings all those trees together.

Steps to build a random forest model:
Randomly select 'k' features from a total of 'm' features where k << m
Among the 'k' features, calculate the node D using the best split point
Split the node into daughter nodes using the best split
Repeat steps two and three until leaf nodes are finalized 
Build forest by repeating steps one to four for 'n' times to create 'n' number of trees "
"How can you avoid overfitting your model? Overfitting refers to a model that is only set for a very small amount of data and ignores the bigger picture. There are three main methods to avoid overfitting:

Keep the model simpleÃ¢ÂÂtake fewer variables into account, thereby removing some of the noise in the training data
Use cross-validation techniques, such as k folds cross-validation 
Use regularization techniques, such as LASSO, that penalize certain model parameters if they're likely to cause overfitting"
"What are the feature selection methods used to select the right variables? There are two main methods for feature selection, i.e, filter, and wrapper methods.

Filter Methods
This involves: 

Linear discrimination analysis
ANOVA
Chi-Square
The best analogy for selecting features is ""bad data in, bad answer out."" When we're limiting or selecting the features, it's all about cleaning up the data coming in. 

Wrapper Methods
This involves: 

Forward Selection: We test one feature at a time and keep adding them until we get a good fit
Backward Selection: We test all the features and start removing them to see what works better
Recursive Feature Elimination: Recursively looks through all the different features and how they pair together
Wrapper methods are very labor-intensive, and high-end computers are needed if a lot of data analysis is performed with the wrapper method. "
"What are dimensionality reduction and its benefits? Dimensionality reduction refers to the process of converting a data set with vast dimensions into data with fewer dimensions (fields) to convey similar information concisely. 

This reduction helps in compressing data and reducing storage space. It also reduces computation time as fewer dimensions lead to less computing. It removes redundant features; for example, there's no point in storing a value in two different units (meters and inches). "
"How should you maintain a deployed model? The steps to maintain a deployed model are:

Monitor 
Constant monitoring of all models is needed to determine their performance accuracy. When you change something, you want to figure out how your changes are going to affect things. This needs to be monitored to ensure it's doing what it's supposed to do.

Evaluate
Evaluation metrics of the current model are calculated to determine if a new algorithm is needed. 

Compare
The new models are compared to each other to determine which model performs the best. 

Rebuild
The best performing model is re-built on the current state of data.
"
"What are recommender systems? A recommender system predicts what a user would rate a specific product based on their preferences. It can be split into two different areas:

Collaborative Filtering
As an example, Last.fm recommends tracks that other users with similar interests play often. This is also commonly seen on Amazon after making a purchase; customers may notice the following message accompanied by product recommendations: ""Users who bought this also boughtÃ¢ÂÂ¦""

Content-based Filtering
As an example: Pandora uses the properties of a song to recommend music with similar properties. Here, we look at content, instead of looking at who else is listening to music."
"How can you select k for k-means? We use the elbow method to select k for k-means clustering. The idea of the elbow method is to run k-means clustering on the data set where 'k' is the number of clusters.

Within the sum of squares (WSS), it is defined as the sum of the squared distance between each member of the cluster and its centroid. "
"What is the significance of p-value? p-value typically Ã¢ÂÂ¤ 0.05

This indicates strong evidence against the null hypothesis; so you reject the null hypothesis.

p-value typically > 0.05

This indicates weak evidence against the null hypothesis, so you accept the null hypothesis. 

p-value at cutoff 0.05 

This is considered to be marginal, meaning it could go either way."
How can time-series data be declared as stationery? It is stationary when the variance and mean of the series are constant with time.
Write the equation and calculate the precision and recall rate.? Precision = (True positive) / (True Positive + False Positive)        Recall Rate = (True Positive) / (Total Positive + False Negative)
"People who bought this also boughtÃ¢ÂÂ¦' recommendations seen on Amazon are a result of which algorithm? The recommendation engine is accomplished with collaborative filtering. Collaborative filtering explains the behavior of other users and their purchase history in terms of ratings, selection, etc. 

The engine makes predictions on what might interest a person based on the preferences of other users. In this algorithm, item features are unknown. "
"We want to predict the probability of death from heart disease based on three risk factors: age, gender, and blood cholesterol level. What is the most appropriate algorithm for this case? Choose the correct option:

Logistic Regression 
Linear Regression
K-means clustering 
Apriori algorithm
The most appropriate algorithm for this case is A, logistic regression. "
"Your organization has a website where visitors randomly receive one of two coupons. It is also possible that visitors to the website will not receive a coupon. You have been asked to determine if offering a coupon to website visitors has any impact on their purchase decisions. Which analysis method should you use? One-way ANOVA 
K-means clustering
Association rules 
Student's t-test 
The answer is A: One-way ANOVA"
"What are the feature vectors? A feature vector is an n-dimensional vector of numerical features that represent an object. In machine learning, feature vectors are used to represent numeric or symbolic characteristics (called features) of an object in a mathematical way that's easy to analyze."
"What are the steps in making a decision tree? Take the entire data set as input.
Look for a split that maximizes the separation of the classes. A split is any test that divides the data into two sets.
Apply the split to the input data (divide step).
Re-apply steps one and two to the divided data.
Stop when you meet any stopping criteria.
This step is called pruning. Clean up the tree if you went too far doing splits."
What is root cause analysis? Root cause analysis was initially developed to analyze industrial accidents but is now widely used in other areas. It is a problem-solving technique used for isolating the root causes of faults or problems. A factor is called a root cause if its deduction from the problem-fault-sequence averts the final undesirable event from recurring.
What is logistic regression? Logistic regression is also known as the logit model. It is a technique used to forecast the binary outcome from a linear combination of predictor variables.
"Explain cross-validation.? Cross-validation is a model validation technique for evaluating how the outcomes of a statistical analysis will generalize to an independent data set. It is mainly used in backgrounds where the objective is to forecast and one wants to estimate how accurately a model will accomplish in practice. 

The goal of cross-validation is to term a data set to test the model in the training phase (i.e. validation data set) to limit problems like overfitting and gain insight into how the model will generalize to an independent data set."
"What is collaborative filtering? Most recommender systems use this filtering process to find patterns and information by collaborating perspectives, numerous data sources, and several agents."
"Do gradient descent methods always converge to similar points? They do not, because in some cases, they reach a local minima or a local optima point. You would not reach the global optima point. This is governed by the data and the starting conditions."
"What is the goal of A/B Testing? This is statistical hypothesis testing for randomized experiments with two variables, A and B. The objective of A/B testing is to detect any changes to a web page to maximize or increase the outcome of a strategy."
"What are the drawbacks of the linear model? The assumption of linearity of the errors
It can't be used for count outcomes or binary outcomes
There are overfitting problems that it can't solve"
"What are eigenvalue and eigenvector? Eigenvalues are the directions along which a particular linear transformation acts by flipping, compressing, or stretching.

Eigenvectors are for understanding linear transformations. In data analysis, we usually calculate the eigenvectors for a correlation or covariance matrix. "
"What is the difference between Point Estimates and Confidence Interval? Point Estimation gives us a particular value as an estimate of a population parameter. Method of Moments and Maximum Likelihood estimator methods are used to derive Point Estimators for population parameters.

A confidence interval gives us a range of values which is likely to contain the population parameter. The confidence interval is generally preferred, as it tells us how likely this interval is to contain the population parameter. This likeliness or probability is called Confidence Level or Confidence coefficient and represented by 1 Ã¢ÂÂ alpha, where alpha is the level of significance."
"What do you understand by statistical power of sensitivity and how do you calculate it? Sensitivity is commonly used to validate the accuracy of a classifier (Logistic, SVM, Random Forest etc.).

Sensitivity is nothing but Ã¢ÂÂPredicted True events/ Total eventsÃ¢ÂÂ. True events here are the events which were true and model also predicted them as true."
Explain how a ROC curve works? The ROC curve is a graphical representation of the contrast between true positive rates and false-positive rates at various thresholds. It is often used as a proxy for the trade-off between the sensitivity(true positive rate) and false-positive rate.
"What is TF/IDF vectorization? TFÃ¢ÂÂIDF is short for term frequency-inverse document frequency, is a numerical statistic that is intended to reflect how important a word is to a document in a collection or corpus. It is often used as a weighting factor in information retrieval and text mining.

The TFÃ¢ÂÂIDF value increases proportionally to the number of times a word appears in the document but is offset by the frequency of the word in the corpus, which helps to adjust for the fact that some words appear more frequently in general."
Why we generally use Softmax non-linearity function as last operation in-network? It is because it takes in a vector of real numbers and returns a probability distribution. It should be clear that the output is a probability distribution: each element is non-negative and the sum over all components is 1.
"Explain SVM algorithm in detail.? SVM stands for support vector machine, it is a supervised machine learning algorithm which can be used for both Regression and Classification. If you have n features in your training data set, SVM tries to plot it in n-dimensional space with the value of each feature being the value of a particular coordinate. SVM uses hyperplanes to separate out different classes based on the provided kernel function."
"What are the different kernels in SVM? There are four types of kernels in SVM.

Linear Kernel

Polynomial kernel

Radial basis kernel

Sigmoid kernel"
"What is the difference between Regression and classification ML techniques? Both Regression and classification machine learning techniques come under Supervised machine learning algorithms. In Supervised machine learning algorithm, we have to train the model using labelled data set, While training we have to explicitly provide the correct labels and algorithm tries to learn the pattern from input to output. If our labels are discrete values then it will a classification problem, e.g A,B etc. but if our labels are continuous values then it will be a regression problem, e.g 1.23, 1.333 etc."
"What are the various steps involved in an analytics project? Understand the Business problem

Explore the data and become familiar with it.

Prepare the data for modelling by detecting outliers, treating missing values, transforming variables, etc.

After data preparation, start running the model, analyze the result and tweak the approach. This is an iterative step until the best possible outcome is achieved.

Validate the model using a new data set.

Start implementing the model and track the result to analyze the performance of the model over the period of time."
What do you mean by Deep Learning? Deep Learning is nothing but a paradigm of machine learning which has shown incredible promise in recent years. This is because of the fact that Deep Learning shows a great analogy with the functioning of the human brain.
"What is the difference between machine learning and deep learning? Machine learning is a field of computer science that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning can be categorised in the following three categories.

Supervised machine learning,

Unsupervised machine learning,

Reinforcement learning 

Deep Learning is a subfield of machine learning concerned with algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the brain called artificial neural networks."
"What, in your opinion, is the reason for the popularity of Deep Learning in recent times? Now although Deep Learning has been around for many years, the major breakthroughs from these techniques came just in recent years. This is because of two main reasons:

The increase in the amount of data generated through various sources

The growth in hardware resources required to run these models

GPUs are multiple times faster and they help us build bigger and deeper deep learning models in comparatively less time than we required previously."
"What Is the Cost Function? Also referred to as Ã¢ÂÂlossÃ¢ÂÂ or Ã¢ÂÂerror,Ã¢ÂÂ cost function is a measure to evaluate how good your modelÃ¢ÂÂs performance is. ItÃ¢ÂÂs used to compute the error of the output layer during backpropagation. We push that error backwards through the neural network and use that during the different training functions.
"
"What Are Hyperparameters? With neural networks, youÃ¢ÂÂre usually working with hyperparameters once the data is formatted correctly. A hyperparameter is a parameter whose value is set before the learning process begins. It determines how a network is trained and the structure of the network (such as the number of hidden units, the learning rate, epochs, etc.)."
"What Are the Different Layers on CNN? Convolutional Layer Ã¢ÂÂ  the layer that performs a convolutional operation, creating several smaller picture windows to go over the data.

ReLU Layer Ã¢ÂÂ it brings non-linearity to the network and converts all the negative pixels to zero. The output is a rectified feature map.

Pooling Layer Ã¢ÂÂ pooling is a down-sampling operation that reduces the dimensionality of the feature map.

Fully Connected Layer Ã¢ÂÂ this layer recognizes and classifies the objects in the image."
"What Is Pooling on CNN, and How Does It Work? Pooling is used to reduce the spatial dimensions of a CNN. It performs down-sampling operations to reduce the dimensionality and creates a pooled feature map by sliding a filter matrix over the input matrix."
"What are Recurrent Neural Networks(RNNs)? RNNs are a type of artificial neural networks designed to recognise the pattern from the sequence of data such as Time series, stock market and government agencies etc. To understand recurrent nets, first, you have to understand the basics of feedforward nets.

Both these networks RNN and feed-forward named after the way they channel information through a series of mathematical orations performed at the nodes of the network. One feeds information through straight(never touching the same node twice), while the other cycles it through a loop, and the latter are called recurrent.

Recurrent networks, on the other hand, take as their input, not just the current input example they see, but also the what they have perceived previously in time.

The decision a recurrent neural network reached at time t-1 affects the decision that it will reach one moment later at time t. So recurrent networks have two sources of input, the present and the recent past, which combine to determine how they respond to new data, much as we do in life.

The error they generate will return via backpropagation and be used to adjust their weights until error canÃ¢ÂÂt go any lower. Remember, the purpose of recurrent nets is to accurately classify sequential input. We rely on the backpropagation of error and gradient descent to do so.

"
"How Does an LSTM Network Work? Long-Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a special kind of recurrent neural network capable of learning long-term dependencies, remembering information for long periods as its default behaviour. There are three steps in an LSTM network:

Step 1: The network decides what to forget and what to remember.
Step 2: It selectively updates cell state values.
Step 3: The network decides what part of the current state makes it to the output."
"What Is a Multi-layer Perceptron(MLP)? As in Neural Networks, MLPs have an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer. It has the same structure as a single layer perceptron with one or more hidden layers. A single layer perceptron can classify only linear separable classes with binary output (0,1), but MLP can classify nonlinear classes.

Except for the input layer, each node in the other layers uses a nonlinear activation function. This means the input layers, the data coming in, and the activation function is based upon all nodes and weights being added together, producing the output. MLP uses a supervised learning method called Ã¢ÂÂbackpropagation.Ã¢ÂÂ In backpropagation, the neural network calculates the error with the help of cost function. It propagates this error backward from where it came (adjusts the weights to train the model more accurately)."
"Explain Gradient Descent.? To Understand Gradient Descent, LetÃ¢ÂÂs understand what is a Gradient first.

A gradient measures how much the output of a function changes if you change the inputs a little bit. It simply measures the change in all weights with regard to the change in error. You can also think of a gradient as the slope of a function.

Gradient Descent can be thought of climbing down to the bottom of a valley, instead of climbing up a hill.  This is because it is a minimization algorithm that minimizes a given function (Activation Function)."
"What is exploding gradients? While training an RNN, if you see exponentially growing (very large) error gradients which accumulate and result in very large updates to neural network model weights during training, theyÃ¢ÂÂre known as exploding gradients. At an extreme, the values of weights can become so large as to overflow and result in NaN values.

This has the effect of your model is unstable and unable to learn from your training data."
"What is vanishing gradients? While training an RNN, your slope can become either too small; this makes the training difficult. When the slope is too small, the problem is known as a Vanishing Gradient. It leads to long training times, poor performance, and low accuracy."
"What is Back Propagation and Explain itÃ¢ÂÂs Working.? Backpropagation is a training algorithm used for multilayer neural network. In this method, we move the error from an end of the network to all weights inside the network and thus allowing efficient computation of the gradient.

It has the following steps:

Forward Propagation of Training Data

Derivatives are computed using output and target

Back Propagate for computing derivative of error wrt output activation

Using previously calculated derivatives for output

Update the Weights"
"What are the variants of Back Propagation? Stochastic Gradient Descent: We use only a single training example for calculation of gradient and update parameters.

Batch Gradient Descent: We calculate the gradient for the whole dataset and perform the update at each iteration.

Mini-batch Gradient Descent: ItÃ¢ÂÂs one of the most popular optimization algorithms. ItÃ¢ÂÂs a variant of Stochastic Gradient Descent and here instead of single training example, mini-batch of samples is used."
"What is an Auto-Encoder? Auto-encoders are simple learning networks that aim to transform inputs into outputs with the minimum possible error. This means that we want the output to be as close to input as possible. We add a couple of layers between the input and the output, and the sizes of these layers are smaller than the input layer. The auto-encoder receives unlabelled input which is then encoded to reconstruct the input."
"What Is Dropout and Batch Normalization? Dropout is a technique of dropping out hidden and visible units of a network randomly to prevent overfitting of data (typically dropping 20 per cent of the nodes). It doubles the number of iterations needed to converge the network.

Batch normalization is the technique to improve the performance and stability of neural networks by normalizing the inputs in every layer so that they have mean output activation of zero and standard deviation of one."
What Do You Mean by Tensor in Tensorflow? A tensor is a mathematical object represented as arrays of higher dimensions. These arrays of data with different dimensions and ranks fed as input to the neural network are called Ã¢ÂÂTensors.Ã¢ÂÂ
"What is the Central Limit Theorem and why is it important? Suppose that we are interested in estimating the average height among all people. Collecting data for every person in the world is impossible. While we canÃ¢ÂÂt obtain a height measurement from everyone in the population, we can still sample some people. The question now becomes, what can we say about the average height of the entire population given a single sample. The Central Limit Theorem addresses this question exactly"
"What are the assumptions required for linear regression? There are four major assumptions: 1. There is a linear relationship between the dependent variables and the regressors, meaning the model you are creating actually fits the data, 2. The errors or residuals of the data are normally distributed and independent from each other, 3. There is minimal multicollinearity between explanatory variables, and 4. Homoscedasticity. This means the variance around the regression line is the same for all values of the predictor variable."
"Explain the 80/20 rule, and tell me about its importance in model validation.? People usually tend to start with a 80-20% split (80% training set Ã¢ÂÂ 20% test set) and split the training set once more into a 80-20% ratio to create the validation set."
"Would you use batch normalization? If so, can you explain why? The idea here is to standardize the data before sending it to another layer. This approach helps reduce the impact of previous layers by keeping the mean and variance constant. It also makes the layers independent of each other to achieve rapid convergence. For example, when we normalize features from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 100, it helps accelerate the learning cycle."
"How would you go about choosing an algorithm to solve a business problem? First, you have to develop a Ã¢ÂÂproblem statementÃ¢ÂÂ thatÃ¢ÂÂs based on the problem provided by the business. This step is essential because itÃ¢ÂÂll help ensure that you fully understand the type of problem and the input and the output of the problem you want to solve.

The problem statement should be simple and no more than a single sentence. For example, letÃ¢ÂÂs consider enterprise spam that requires an algorithm to identify it.

The problem statement would be: Ã¢ÂÂIs the email fake/spam or not?Ã¢ÂÂ In this scenario, the identification of whether itÃ¢ÂÂs fake/spam will be the output.

Once you have defined the problem statement, you have to identify the appropriate algorithm from the following:

Any classification algorithm
Any clustering algorithm
Any regression algorithm
Any recommendation algorithm
Which algorithm you use will depend on the specific problem youÃ¢ÂÂre trying to solve. In this scenario, you can move forward with a clustering algorithm and choose a k-means algorithm to achieve your goal of filtering spam from the email system.

While examples arenÃ¢ÂÂt always necessary when answering questions about artificial intelligence, sometimes it will help make it easier for you to get your point across."
"WhatÃ¢ÂÂs the difference between inductive, deductive, and abductive learning? Inductive learning describes smart algorithms that learn from a set of instances to draw conclusions. In statistical ML, k-nearest neighbor and support vector machine are good examples of inductive learning.

There are three literals in (top-down) inductive learning:

Arithmetic literals
Equality and inequality
Predicates
In deductive learning, the smart algorithms draw conclusions by following a truth-generating structure (major premise, minor premise, and conclusion) and then improve them based on previous decisions. In this scenario, the ML algorithm engages in deductive reasoning using a decision tree.

Abductive learning is a DL technique where conclusions are made based on various instances. With this approach, inductive reasoning is applied to causal relationships in deep neural networks."
"What steps would you take to evaluate the effectiveness of your ML model? You have to first split the data set into training and test sets. You also have the option of using a cross-validation technique to further segment the data set into a composite of training and test sets within the data.

Then you have to implement a choice selection of the performance metrics like the following:

Confusion matrix
Accuracy
Precision
Recall or sensitivity
Specificity
F1 score
For the most part, you can use measures such as accuracy, confusion matrix, or F1 score. However, itÃ¢ÂÂll be critical for you to demonstrate that you understand the nuances of how each model can be measured by choosing the right performance measure to match the problem."
"What is BayesÃ¢ÂÂ Theorem? How is it useful in a machine learning context? BayesÃ¢ÂÂ Theorem gives you the posterior probability of an event given what is known as prior knowledge.

Mathematically, itÃ¢ÂÂs expressed as the true positive rate of a condition sample divided by the sum of the false positive rate of the population and the true positive rate of a condition. Say you had a 60% chance of actually having the flu after a flu test, but out of people who had the flu, the test will be false 50% of the time, and the overall population only has a 5% chance of having the flu. Would you actually have a 60% chance of having the flu after having a positive test?

BayesÃ¢ÂÂ Theorem says no. It says that you have a (.6 * 0.05) (True Positive Rate of a Condition Sample) / (.6*0.05)(True Positive Rate of a Condition Sample) + (.5*0.95) (False Positive Rate of a Population)  = 0.0594 or 5.94% chance of getting a flu.

BayesÃ¢ÂÂ Theorem is the basis behind a branch of machine learning that most notably includes the Naive Bayes classifier. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs something important to consider when youÃ¢ÂÂre faced with machine learning interview questions."
"Why is Ã¢ÂÂNaiveÃ¢ÂÂ Bayes naive? Despite its practical applications, especially in text mining, Naive Bayes is considered Ã¢ÂÂNaiveÃ¢ÂÂ because it makes an assumption that is virtually impossible to see in real-life data: the conditional probability is calculated as the pure product of the individual probabilities of components. This implies the absolute independence of features Ã¢ÂÂ a condition probably never met in real life.

As a Quora commenter put it whimsically, a Naive Bayes classifier that figured out that you liked pickles and ice cream would probably naively recommend you a pickle ice cream."
"Explain the difference between L1 and L2 regularization.? L2 regularization tends to spread error among all the terms, while L1 is more binary/sparse, with many variables either being assigned a 1 or 0 in weighting. L1 corresponds to setting a Laplacean prior on the terms, while L2 corresponds to a Gaussian prior."
"WhatÃ¢ÂÂs a Fourier transform? A Fourier transform is a generic method to decompose generic functions into a superposition of symmetric functions. Or as this more intuitive tutorial puts it, given a smoothie, itÃ¢ÂÂs how we find the recipe. The Fourier transform finds the set of cycle speeds, amplitudes, and phases to match any time signal. A Fourier transform converts a signal from time to frequency domainÃ¢ÂÂitÃ¢ÂÂs a very common way to extract features from audio signals or other time series such as sensor data."
"What is deep learning, and how does it contrast with other machine learning algorithms? Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that is concerned with neural networks: how to use backpropagation and certain principles from neuroscience to more accurately model large sets of unlabelled or semi-structured data. In that sense, deep learning represents an unsupervised learning algorithm that learns representations of data through the use of neural nets."
WhatÃ¢ÂÂs the difference between a generative and discriminative model? A generative model will learn categories of data while a discriminative model will simply learn the distinction between different categories of data. Discriminative models will generally outperform generative models on classification tasks.
"WhatÃ¢ÂÂs the F1 score? How would you use it? The F1 score is a measure of a modelÃ¢ÂÂs performance. It is a weighted average of the precision and recall of a model, with results tending to 1 being the best, and those tending to 0 being the worst. You would use it in classification tests where true negatives donÃ¢ÂÂt matter much."
"When should you use classification over regression? Classification produces discrete values and dataset to strict categories, while regression gives you continuous results that allow you to better distinguish differences between individual points. You would use classification over regression if you wanted your results to reflect the belongingness of data points in your dataset to certain explicit categories."
"WhatÃ¢ÂÂs the Ã¢ÂÂkernel trickÃ¢ÂÂ and how is it useful? The Kernel trick involves kernel functions that can enable in higher-dimension spaces without explicitly calculating the coordinates of points within that dimension: instead, kernel functions compute the inner products between the images of all pairs of data in a feature space. This allows them the very useful attribute of calculating the coordinates of higher dimensions while being computationally cheaper than the explicit calculation of said coordinates. Many algorithms can be expressed in terms of inner products. Using the kernel trick enables us effectively run algorithms in a high-dimensional space with lower-dimensional data."
"Do you have experience with Spark or big data tools for machine learning? YouÃ¢ÂÂll want to get familiar with the meaning of big data for different companies and the different tools theyÃ¢ÂÂll want. Spark is the big data tool most in demand now, able to handle immense datasets with speed. Be honest if you donÃ¢ÂÂt have experience with the tools demanded, but also take a look at job descriptions and see what tools pop up: youÃ¢ÂÂll want to invest in familiarizing yourself with them."
"How would you build a data pipeline? Data pipelines are the bread and butter of machine learning engineers, who take data science models and find ways to automate and scale them. Make sure youÃ¢ÂÂre familiar with the tools to build data pipelines (such as Apache Airflow) and the platforms where you can host models and pipelines (such as Google Cloud or AWS or Azure). Explain the steps required in a functioning data pipeline and talk through your actual experience building and scaling them in production. "
"Is more data always better? Statistically,
It depends on the quality of your data, for example, if your data is biased, just getting more data wonÃ¢ÂÂt help.
It depends on your model. If your model suffers from high bias, getting more data wonÃ¢ÂÂt improve your test results beyond a point. YouÃ¢ÂÂd need to add more features, etc.

Practically,
Also thereÃ¢ÂÂs a tradeoff between having more data and the additional storage, computational power, memory it requires. Hence, always think about the cost of having more data."
"How can you make sure that you donÃ¢ÂÂt analyze something that ends up meaningless? Proper exploratory data analysis.
In every data analysis task, there's the exploratory phase where you're just graphing things, testing things on small sets of the data, summarizing simple statistics, and getting rough ideas of what hypotheses you might want to pursue further.

Then there's the exploitatory phase, where you look deeply into a set of hypotheses. 

The exploratory phase will generate lots of possible hypotheses, and the exploitatory phase will let you really understand a few of them. Balance the two and you'll prevent yourself from wasting time on many things that end up meaningless, although not all."
"How can you determine which features are the most important in your model? Run the features though a Gradient Boosting Machine or Random Forest to generate plots of relative importance and information gain for each feature in the ensembles.

Look at the variables added in forward variable selection "
"What are some ways I can make my model more robust to outliers? We can have regularization such as L1 or L2 to reduce variance (increase bias).

Changes to the algorithm:
Use tree-based methods instead of regression methods as they are more resistant to outliers. For statistical tests, use non parametric tests instead of parametric ones.
Use robust error metrics such as MAE or Huber Loss instead of MSE.

Changes to the data:
Winsorizing the data
Transforming the data (e.g. log)
Remove them only if youÃ¢ÂÂre certain theyÃ¢ÂÂre anomalies not worth predicting"
"What are some differences you would expect in a model that minimizes squared error, versus a model that minimizes absolute error? In which cases would each error metric be appropriate? MSE is more strict to having outliers. MAE is more robust in that sense, but is harder to fit the model for because it cannot be numerically optimized. So when there are less variability in the model and the model is computationally easy to fit, we should use MAE, and if thatÃ¢ÂÂs not the case, we should use MSE.
MSE: easier to compute the gradient, MAE: linear programming needed to compute the gradient
MAE more robust to outliers. If the consequences of large errors are great, use MSE
MSE corresponds to maximizing likelihood of Gaussian random variables"
"What error metric would you use to evaluate how good a binary classifier is? What if the classes are imbalanced? What if there are more than 2 groups? Accuracy: proportion of instances you predict correctly. Pros: intuitive, easy to explain, Cons: works poorly when the class labels are imbalanced and the signal from the data is weak
AUROC: plot fpr on the x axis and tpr on the y axis for different threshold. Given a random positive instance and a random negative instance, the AUC is the probability that you can identify who's who. Pros: Works well when testing the ability of distinguishing the two classes, Cons: canÃ¢ÂÂt interpret predictions as probabilities (because AUC is determined by rankings), so canÃ¢ÂÂt explain the uncertainty of the model
logloss/deviance: Pros: error metric based on probabilities, Cons: very sensitive to false positives, negatives
When there are more than 2 groups, we can have k binary classifications and add them up for logloss. Some metrics like AUC is only applicable in the binary case."
"What are various ways to predict a binary response variable? Can you compare two of them and tell me when one would be more appropriate? WhatÃ¢ÂÂs the difference between these? (SVM, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, etc.)? Things to look at: N, P, linearly seperable?, features independent?, likely to overfit?, speed, performance, memory usage
Logistic Regression
features roughly linear, problem roughly linearly separable
robust to noise, use l1,l2 regularization for model selection, avoid overfitting
the output come as probabilities
efficient and the computation can be distributed
can be used as a baseline for other algorithms
(-) can hardly handle categorical features
SVM
with a nonlinear kernel, can deal with problems that are not linearly separable
(-) slow to train, for most industry scale applications, not really efficient
Naive Bayes
computationally efficient when P is large by alleviating the curse of dimensionality
works surprisingly well for some cases even if the condition doesnÃ¢ÂÂt hold
with word frequencies as features, the independence assumption can be seen reasonable. So the algorithm can be used in text categorization
(-) conditional independence of every other feature should be met
Tree Ensembles
good for large N and large P, can deal with categorical features very well
non parametric, so no need to worry about outliers
GBTÃ¢ÂÂs work better but the parameters are harder to tune
RF works out of the box, but usually performs worse than GBT
Deep Learning
works well for some classification tasks (e.g. image)
used to squeeze something out of the problem"
"Given training data on tweets and their retweets, how would you predict the number of retweets of a given tweet after 7 days after only observing 2 days worth of data? Build a time series model with the training data with a seven day cycle and then use that for a new data with only 2 days data.
Ask someone for more details.
Build a regression function to estimate the number of retweets as a function of time t
to determine if one regression function can be built, see if there are clusters in terms of the trends in the number of retweets
if not, we have to add features to the regression function
features + # of retweets on the first and the second day -> predict the seventh day"
"In an A/B test, how can you check if assignment to the various buckets was truly random? Plot the distributions of multiple features for both A and B and make sure that they have the same shape. More rigorously, we can conduct a permutation test to see if the distributions are the same.
MANOVA to compare different means"
"What might be the benefits of running an A/A test, where you have two buckets who are exposed to the exact same product? Verify the sampling algorithm is random."
"What would be the hazards of letting users sneak a peek at the other bucket in an A/B test? The user might not act the same suppose had they not seen the other bucket. You are essentially adding additional variables of whether the user peeked the other bucket, which are not random across groups."
"How would you run an A/B test for many variants, say 20 or more? one control, 20 treatment, if the sample size for each group is big enough.
Ways to attempt to correct for this include changing your confidence level (e.g. Bonferroni Correction) or doing family-wide tests before you dive in to the individual metrics (e.g. Fisher's Protected LSD)."
"How would you run an A/B test if the observations are extremely right-skewed? lower the variability by modifying the KPI
cap values
percentile metrics
log transform"
"What is a p-value? What is the difference between type-1 and type-2 error? A p-value is defined such that under the null hypothesis less than the fraction p of events have parameter values more extreme than the observed parameter. It is not the probability that the null hypothesis is wrong.
type-1 error: rejecting Ho when Ho is true
type-2 error: not rejecting Ho when Ha is true"
"You are AirBnB and you want to test the hypothesis that a greater number of photographs increases the chances that a buyer selects the listing. How would you test this hypothesis? For randomly selected listings with more than 1 pictures, hide 1 random picture for group A, and show all for group B. Compare the booking rate for the two groups."
"How would you design an experiment to determine the impact of latency on user engagement? The best way I know to quantify the impact of performance is to isolate just that factor using a slowdown experiment, i.e., add a delay in an A/B test."
"What is maximum likelihood estimation? Could there be any case where it doesnÃ¢ÂÂt exist? A method for parameter optimization (fitting a model). We choose parameters so as to maximize the likelihood function (how likely the outcome would happen given the current data and our model).
maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is a method of estimating the parameters of a statistical model given observations, by finding the parameter values that maximize the likelihood of making the observations given the parameters. MLE can be seen as a special case of the maximum a posteriori estimation (MAP) that assumes a uniform prior distribution of the parameters, or as a variant of the MAP that ignores the prior and which therefore is unregularized.
for gaussian mixtures, non parametric models, it doesnÃ¢ÂÂt exist."
"What is a confidence interval and how do you interpret it? For example, 95% confidence interval is an interval that when constructed for a set of samples each sampled in the same way, the constructed intervals include the true mean 95% of the time.
if confidence intervals are constructed using a given confidence level in an infinite number of independent experiments, the proportion of those intervals that contain the true value of the parameter will match the confidence level."
"What is Selection Bias? Selection bias is a kind of error that occurs when the researcher decides who is going to be studied. It is usually associated with research where the selection of participants isnÃ¢ÂÂt random. It is sometimes referred to as the selection effect. It is the distortion of statistical analysis, resulting from the method of collecting samples. If the selection bias is not taken into account, then some conclusions of the study may not be accurate.
The types of selection bias include:
Sampling bias: It is a systematic error due to a non-random sample of a population causing some members of the population to be less likely to be included than others resulting in a biased sample.
Time Interval bias: A trial may be terminated early at an extreme value (often for ethical reasons), but the extreme value is likely to be reached by the variable with the largest variance, even if all variables have a similar mean.
Data: When specific subsets of data are chosen to support a conclusion or rejection of bad data on arbitrary grounds, instead of according to previously stated or generally agreed criteria.
Attrition: Attrition bias is a kind of selection bias caused by attrition (loss of participants) discounting trial subjects/tests that did not run to completion."
"What is regression? Which models can you use to solve a regression problem? Regression is a part of supervised ML. Regression models investigate the relationship between a dependent (target) and independent variable (s) (predictor). Here are some common regression models

Linear Regression establishes a linear relationship between target and predictor (s). It predicts a numeric value and has a shape of a straight line.
Polynomial Regression has a regression equation with the power of independent variable more than 1. It is a curve that fits into the data points.
Ridge Regression helps when predictors are highly correlated (multicollinearity problem). It penalizes the squares of regression coefficients but doesnÃ¢ÂÂt allow the coefficients to reach zeros (uses L2 regularization).
Lasso Regression penalizes the absolute values of regression coefficients and allows some of the coefficients to reach absolute zero (thereby allowing feature selection)."
"What are the main assumptions of linear regression? There are several assumptions of linear regression. If any of them is violated, model predictions and interpretation may be worthless or misleading.

Linear relationship between features and target variable.
Additivity means that the effect of changes in one of the features on the target variable does not depend on values of other features. For example, a model for predicting revenue of a company have of two features - the number of items a sold and the number of items b sold. When company sells more items a the revenue increases and this is independent of the number of items b sold. But, if customers who buy a stop buying b, the additivity assumption is violated.
Features are not correlated (no collinearity) since it can be difficult to separate out the individual effects of collinear features on the target variable.
Errors are independently and identically normally distributed (yi = B0 + B1*x1i + ... + errori):
No correlation between errors (consecutive errors in the case of time series data).
Constant variance of errors - homoscedasticity. For example, in case of time series, seasonal patterns can increase errors in seasons with higher activity.
Errors are normaly distributed, otherwise some features will have more influence on the target variable than to others. If the error distribution is significantly non-normal, confidence intervals may be too wide or too narrow."
"WhatÃ¢ÂÂs the normal distribution? Why do we care about it? The normal distribution derives its importance from the Central Limit Theorem, which states that if we draw a large enough number of samples, their mean will follow a normal distribution regardless of the initial distribution of the sample, i.e the distribution of the mean of the samples is normal. It is important that each sample is independent from the other.

This is powerful because it helps us study processes whose population distribution is unknown to us."
"How do we check if a variable follows the normal distribution? Plot a histogram out of the sampled data. If you can fit the bell-shaped ""normal"" curve to the histogram, then the hypothesis that the underlying random variable follows the normal distribution can not be rejected.
Check Skewness and Kurtosis of the sampled data. Skewness = 0 and kurtosis = 3 are typical for a normal distribution, so the farther away they are from these values, the more non-normal the distribution.
Use Kolmogorov-Smirnov or/and Shapiro-Wilk tests for normality. They take into account both Skewness and Kurtosis simultaneously.
Check for Quantile-Quantile plot. It is a scatterplot created by plotting two sets of quantiles against one another. Normal Q-Q plot place the data points in a roughly straight line."
"What if we want to build a model for predicting prices? Are prices distributed normally? Do we need to do any pre-processing for prices? Data is not normal. Specially, real-world datasets or uncleaned datasets always have certain skewness. Same goes for the price prediction. Price of houses or any other thing under consideration depends on a number of factors. So, there's a great chance of presence of some skewed values i.e outliers if we talk in data science terms.

Yes, you may need to do pre-processing. Most probably, you will need to remove the outliers to make your distribution near-to-normal."
"What methods for solving linear regression do you know? To solve linear regression, you need to find the coefficients  which minimize the sum of squared errors.

Matrix Algebra method: Let's say you have X, a matrix of features, and y, a vector with the values you want to predict. After going through the matrix algebra and minimization problem, you get this solution: .

But solving this requires you to find an inverse, which can be time-consuming, if not impossible. Luckily, there are methods like Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) or QR Decomposition that can reliably calculate this part  (called the pseudo-inverse) without actually needing to find an inverse. The popular python ML library sklearn uses SVD to solve least squares."
"What is gradient descent? How does it work? Gradient descent is an algorithm that uses calculus concept of gradient to try and reach local or global minima. It works by taking the negative of the gradient in a point of a given function, and updating that point repeatedly using the calculated negative gradient, until the algorithm reaches a local or global minimum, which will cause future iterations of the algorithm to return values that are equal or too close to the current point. It is widely used in machine learning applications."
What is the normal equation? Normal equations are equations obtained by setting equal to zero the partial derivatives of the sum of squared errors (least squares); normal equations allow one to estimate the parameters of a multiple linear regression.
"What is SGD Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ stochastic gradient descent? WhatÃ¢ÂÂs the difference with the usual gradient descent? In both gradient descent (GD) and stochastic gradient descent (SGD), you update a set of parameters in an iterative manner to minimize an error function.

While in GD, you have to run through ALL the samples in your training set to do a single update for a parameter in a particular iteration, in SGD, on the other hand, you use ONLY ONE or SUBSET of training sample from your training set to do the update for a parameter in a particular iteration. If you use SUBSET, it is called Minibatch Stochastic gradient Descent.
"
"Which metrics for evaluating regression models do you know? Mean Squared Error(MSE)
Root Mean Squared Error(RMSE)
Mean Absolute Error(MAE)
RÃÂ² or Coefficient of Determination
Adjusted RÃÂ²"
What are MSE and RMSE? MSE stands for Mean Square Error while RMSE stands for Root Mean Square Error. They are metrics with which we can evaluate models.
"What is the bias-variance trade-off? Bias is the error introduced by approximating the true underlying function, which can be quite complex, by a simpler model. Variance is a model sensitivity to changes in the training dataset.

Bias-variance trade-off is a relationship between the expected test error and the variance and the bias - both contribute to the level of the test error and ideally should be as small as possible:

ExpectedTestError = Variance + BiasÃÂ² + IrreducibleError
But as a model complexity increases, the bias decreases and the variance increases which leads to overfitting. And vice versa, model simplification helps to decrease the variance but it increases the bias which leads to underfitting."
"What is K-fold cross-validation? K fold cross validation is a method of cross validation where we select a hyperparameter k. The dataset is now divided into k parts. Now, we take the 1st part as validation set and remaining k-1 as training set. Then we take the 2nd part as validation set and remaining k-1 parts as training set. Like this, each part is used as validation set once and the remaining k-1 parts are taken together and used as training set. It should not be used in a time series data."
"How do we choose K in K-fold cross-validation? WhatÃ¢ÂÂs your favorite K? There are two things to consider while deciding K: the number of models we get and the size of validation set. We do not want the number of models to be too less, like 2 or 3. At least 4 models give a less biased decision on the metrics. On the other hand, we would want the dataset to be at least 20-25% of the entire data. So that at least a ratio of 3:1 between training and validation set is maintained.
I tend to use 4 for small datasets and 5 for large ones as K."
"Is logistic regression a linear model? Why? Yes, Logistic Regression is considered a generalized linear model because the outcome always depends on the sum of the inputs and parameters. Or in other words, the output cannot depend on the product (or quotient, etc.) of its parameters."
"What is logistic regression? When do we need to use it? Logistic regression is a Machine Learning algorithm that is used for binary classification. You should use logistic regression when your Y variable takes only two values, e.g. True and False, ""spam"" and ""not spam"", ""churn"" and ""not churn"" and so on. The variable is said to be a ""binary"" or ""dichotomous"".
"
"What is sigmoid? What does it do? A sigmoid function is a type of activation function, and more specifically defined as a squashing function. Squashing functions limit the output to a range between 0 and 1, making these functions useful in the prediction of probabilities.

Sigmod(x) = 1/(1+e^{-x})"
"Precision-recall trade-off? Tradeoff means increasing one parameter would lead to decreasing of other. Precision-recall tradeoff occur due to increasing one of the parameter(precision or recall) while keeping the model same.

In an ideal scenario where there is a perfectly separable data, both precision and recall can get maximum value of 1.0. But in most of the practical situations, there is noise in the dataset and the dataset is not perfectly separable. There might be some points of positive class closer to the negative class and vice versa. In such cases, shifting the decision boundary can either increase the precision or recall but not both. Increasing one parameter leads to decreasing of the other."
What is the ROC curve? When to use it? ROC stands for Receiver Operating Characteristics. The diagrammatic representation that shows the contrast between true positive rate vs false positive rate. It is used when we need to predict the probability of the binary outcome.
"What is AUC (AU ROC)? When to use it? AUC stands for Area Under the ROC Curve. ROC is a probability curve and AUC represents degree or measure of separability. It's used when we need to value how much model is capable of distinguishing between classes. The value is between 0 and 1, the higher the better."
"How to interpret the AU ROC score? AUC score is the value of Area Under the ROC Curve.

An excellent model has AUC near to the 1 which means it has good measure of separability. A poor model has AUC near to the 0 which means it has worst measure of separability. When AUC score is 0.5, it means model has no class separation capacity whatsoever."
What is the PR (precision-recall) curve? A precision-recall curve (or PR Curve) is a plot of the precision (y-axis) and the recall (x-axis) for different probability thresholds. Precision-recall curves (PR curves) are recommended for highly skewed domains where ROC curves may provide an excessively optimistic view of the performance.
"What is the area under the PR curve? Is it a useful metric? The Precision-Recall AUC is just like the ROC AUC, in that it summarizes the curve with a range of threshold values as a single score.

A high area under the curve represents both high recall and high precision, where high precision relates to a low false positive rate, and high recall relates to a low false negative rate."
"In which cases AU PR is better than AU ROC? What is different however is that AU ROC looks at a true positive rate TPR and false positive rate FPR while AU PR looks at positive predictive value PPV and true positive rate TPR.

Typically, if true negatives are not meaningful to the problem or you care more about the positive class, AU PR is typically going to be more useful; otherwise, If you care equally about the positive and negative class or your dataset is quite balanced, then going with AU ROC is a good idea."
"What do we do with categorical variables? Categorical variables must be encoded before they can be used as features to train a machine learning model. There are various encoding techniques, including:

One-hot encoding
Label encoding
Ordinal encoding
Target encoding"
"What kind of regularization techniques are applicable to linear models? AIC/BIC, Ridge regression, Lasso, Elastic Net, Basis pursuit denoising, RudinÃ¢ÂÂOsherÃ¢ÂÂFatemi model (TV), Potts model, RLAD, Dantzig Selector,SLOPE"
"WhatÃ¢ÂÂs the effect of L2 regularization on the weights of a linear model? L2 regularization penalizes larger weights more severely (due to the squared penalty term), which encourages weight values to decay toward zero."
How L1 regularization looks like in a linear model? L1 regularization adds a penalty term to our cost function which is equal to the sum of modules of models coefficients multiplied by a lambda hyperparameter.
"WhatÃ¢ÂÂs the difference between L2 and L1 regularization? Penalty terms: L1 regularization uses the sum of the absolute values of the weights, while L2 regularization uses the sum of the weights squared.
Feature selection: L1 performs feature selection by reducing the coefficients of some predictors to 0, while L2 does not.
Computational efficiency: L2 has an analytical solution, while L1 does not.
Multicollinearity: L2 addresses multicollinearity by constraining the coefficient norm."
"Can we have both L1 and L2 regularization components in a linear model? Yes, elastic net regularization combines L1 and L2 regularization."
"WhatÃ¢ÂÂs the interpretation of the bias term in linear models? Bias is simply, a difference between predicted value and actual/true value. It can be interpreted as the distance from the average prediction and true value i.e. true value minus mean(predictions). But dont get confused between accuracy and bias."
"How do we interpret weights in linear models? Without normalizing weights or variables, if you increase the corresponding predictor by one unit, the coefficient represents on average how much the output changes. By the way, this interpretation still works for logistic regression - if you increase the corresponding predictor by one unit, the weight represents the change in the log of the odds.

If the variables are normalized, we can interpret weights in linear models like the importance of this variable in the predicted result."
"If a weight for one variable is higher than for another Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ can we say that this variable is more important? Yes - if your predictor variables are normalized.

Without normalization, the weight represents the change in the output per unit change in the predictor. If you have a predictor with a huge range and scale that is used to predict an output with a very small range - for example, using each nation's GDP to predict maternal mortality rates - your coefficient should be very small. That does not necessarily mean that this predictor variable is not important compared to the others."
"When do we need to perform feature normalization for linear models? When itÃ¢ÂÂs okay not to do it? Feature normalization is necessary for L1 and L2 regularizations. The idea of both methods is to penalize all the features relatively equally. This can't be done effectively if every feature is scaled differently.

Linear regression without regularization techniques can be used without feature normalization. Also, regularization can help to make the analytical solution more stable, Ã¢ÂÂ it adds the regularization matrix to the feature matrix before inverting it."
"Which feature selection techniques do you know? Here are some of the feature selections:

Principal Component Analysis
Neighborhood Component Analysis
ReliefF Algorithm"
"Can we use L1 regularization for feature selection? Yes, because the nature of L1 regularization will lead to sparse coefficients of features. Feature selection can be done by keeping only features with non-zero coefficients."
"What are the benefits of a single decision tree compared to more complex models? easy to implement
fast training
fast inference
good explainability"
"How can we know which features are more important for the decision tree model? Often, we want to find a split such that it minimizes the sum of the node impurities. The impurity criterion is a parameter of decision trees. Popular methods to measure the impurity are the Gini impurity and the entropy describing the information gain."
"Why do we need randomization in random forest? Random forest in an extention of the bagging algorithm which takes random data samples from the training dataset (with replacement), trains several models and averages predictions. In addition to that, each time a split in a tree is considered, random forest takes a random sample of m features from full set of n features (with replacement) and uses this subset of features as candidates for the split (for example, m = sqrt(n)).

Training decision trees on random data samples from the training dataset reduces variance. Sampling features for each split in a decision tree decorrelates trees."
"How do we select the depth of the trees in random forest? The greater the depth, the greater amount of information is extracted from the tree, however, there is a limit to this, and the algorithm even if defensive against overfitting may learn complex features of noise present in data and as a result, may overfit on noise. Hence, there is no hard thumb rule in deciding the depth, but literature suggests a few tips on tuning the depth of the tree to prevent overfitting:

limit the maximum depth of a tree
limit the number of test nodes
limit the minimum number of objects at a node required to split
do not split a node when, at least, one of the resulting subsample sizes is below a given threshold
stop developing a node if it does not sufficiently improve the fit."
"How do we know how many trees we need in random forest? The number of trees in random forest is worked by n_estimators, and a random forest reduces overfitting by increasing the number of trees. There is no fixed thumb rule to decide the number of trees in a random forest, it is rather fine tuned with the data, typically starting off by taking the square of the number of features (n) present in the data followed by tuning until we get the optimal results."
"What happens when we have correlated features in our data? In random forest, since random forest samples some features to build each tree, the information contained in correlated features is twice as much likely to be picked than any other information contained in other features.

In general, when you are adding correlated features, it means that they linearly contains the same information and thus it will reduce the robustness of your model. Each time you train your model, your model might pick one feature or the other to ""do the same job"" i.e. explain some variance, reduce entropy, etc.
"
"What is gradient boosting trees? Gradient boosting is a machine learning technique for regression and classification problems, which produces a prediction model in the form of an ensemble of weak prediction models, typically decision trees."
"WhatÃ¢ÂÂs the difference between random forest and gradient boosting? Random Forests builds each tree independently while Gradient Boosting builds one tree at a time.
Random Forests combine results at the end of the process (by averaging or ""majority rules"") while Gradient Boosting combines results along the way."
"Is it possible to parallelize training of a gradient boosting model? How to do it? Yes, different frameworks provide different options to make training faster, using GPUs to speed up the process by making it highly parallelizable.For example, for XGBoost tree_method = 'gpu_hist' option makes training faster by use of GPUs."
"How do you approach tuning parameters in XGBoost or LightGBM? Depending upon the dataset, parameter tuning can be done manually or using hyperparameter optimization frameworks such as optuna and hyperopt. In manual parameter tuning, we need to be aware of max-depth, min_samples_leaf and min_samples_split so that our model does not overfit the data but try to predict generalized characteristics of data (basically keeping variance and bias low for our model)."
"How do you select the number of trees in the gradient boosting model? Most implementations of gradient boosting are configured by default with a relatively small number of trees, such as hundreds or thousands. Using scikit-learn we can perform a grid search of the n_estimators model parameter"
"Which hyper-parameter tuning strategies (in general) do you know? WhatÃ¢ÂÂs the difference between grid search parameter tuning strategy and random search? When to use one or another? There are several strategies for hyper-tuning but I would argue that the three most popular nowadays are the following:

Grid Search is an exhaustive approach such that for each hyper-parameter, the user needs to manually give a list of values for the algorithm to try. After these values are selected, grid search then evaluates the algorithm using each and every combination of hyper-parameters and returns the combination that gives the optimal result (i.e. lowest MAE). Because grid search evaluates the given algorithm using all combinations, it's easy to see that this can be quite computationally expensive and can lead to sub-optimal results specifically since the user needs to specify specific values for these hyper-parameters, which is prone for error and requires domain knowledge.

Random Search is similar to grid search but differs in the sense that rather than specifying which values to try for each hyper-parameter, an upper and lower bound of values for each hyper-parameter is given instead. With uniform probability, random values within these bounds are then chosen and similarly, the best combination is returned to the user. Although this seems less intuitive, no domain knowledge is necessary and theoretically much more of the parameter space can be explored.

In a completely different framework, Bayesian Optimization is thought of as a more statistical way of optimization and is commonly used when using neural networks, specifically since one evaluation of a neural network can be computationally costly. In numerous research papers, this method heavily outperforms Grid Search and Random Search and is currently used on the Google Cloud Platform as well as AWS. Because an in-depth explanation requires a heavy background in bayesian statistics and gaussian processes (and maybe even some game theory), a ""simple"" explanation is that a much simpler/faster acquisition function intelligently chooses (using a surrogate function such as probability of improvement or GP-UCB) which hyper-parameter values to try on the computationally expensive, original algorithm. Using the result of the initial combination of values on the expensive/original function, the acquisition function takes the result of the expensive/original algorithm into account and uses it as its prior knowledge to again come up with another set of hyper-parameters to choose during the next iteration. This process continues either for a specified number of iterations or for a specified amount of time and similarly the combination of hyper-parameters that performs the best on the expensive/original algorithm is chosen.
"
"What kind of problems neural nets can solve? Neural nets are good at solving non-linear problems. Some good examples are problems that are relatively easy for humans (because of experience, intuition, understanding, etc), but difficult for traditional regression models: speech recognition, handwriting recognition, image identification, etc."
"How does a usual fully-connected feed-forward neural network work? In a usual fully-connected feed-forward network, each neuron receives input from every element of the previous layer and thus the receptive field of a neuron is the entire previous layer. They are usually used to represent feature vectors for input data in classification problems but can be expensive to train because of the number of computations involved."
"Why do we need activation functions? The main idea of using neural networks is to learn complex nonlinear functions. If we are not using an activation function in between different layers of a neural network, we are just stacking up multiple linear layers one on top of another and this leads to learning a linear function. The Nonlinearity comes only with the activation function, this is the reason we need activation functions."
What are the problems with sigmoid as an activation function? The derivative of the sigmoid function for large positive or negative numbers is almost zero. From this comes the problem of vanishing gradient Ã¢ÂÂ during the backpropagation our net will not learn (or will learn drastically slow). One possible way to solve this problem is to use ReLU activation function.
"What is ReLU? How is it better than sigmoid or tanh? ReLU is an abbreviation for Rectified Linear Unit. It is an activation function which has the value 0 for all negative values and the value f(x) = x for all positive values. The ReLU has a simple activation function which makes it fast to compute and while the sigmoid and tanh activation functions saturate at higher values, the ReLU has a potentially infinite activation, which addresses the problem of vanishing gradients."
"How we can initialize the weights of a neural network? Proper initialization of weight matrix in neural network is very necessary. Simply we can say there are two ways for initializtions.

Initializing weights with zeroes. Setting weights to zero makes your network no better than a linear model. It is important to note that setting biases to 0 will not create any troubles as non zero weights take care of breaking the symmetry and even if bias is 0, the values in every neuron are still different.
Initializing weights randomly. Assigning random values to weights is better than just 0 assignment.
a) If weights are initialized with very high values the term np.dot(W,X)+b becomes significantly higher and if an activation function like sigmoid() is applied, the function maps its value near to 1 where the slope of gradient changes slowly and learning takes a lot of time.
b) If weights are initialized with low values it gets mapped to 0, where the case is the same as above. This problem is often referred to as the vanishing gradient."
"What if we set all the weights of a neural network to 0? If all the weights of a neural network are set to zero, the output of each connection is same (W*x = 0). This means the gradients which are backpropagated to each connection in a layer is same. This means all the connections/weights learn the same thing, and the model never converges."
"What regularization techniques for neural nets do you know? L1 Regularization - Defined as the sum of absolute values of the individual parameters. The L1 penalty causes a subset of the weights to become zero, suggesting that the corresponding features may safely be discarded.
L2 Regularization - Defined as the sum of square of individual parameters. Often supported by regularization hyperparameter alpha. It results in weight decay.
Data Augmentation - This requires some fake data to be created as a part of training set.
Drop Out : This is most effective regularization technique for newral nets. Few randome nodes in each layer is deactivated in forward pass. This allows the algorithm to train on different set of nodes in each iterations."
"What is dropout? Why is it useful? How does it work? Dropout is a technique that at each training step turns off each neuron with a certain probability of p. This way at each iteration we train only 1-p of neurons, which forces the network not to rely only on the subset of neurons for feature representation. This leads to regularizing effects that are controlled by the hyperparameter p.
"
"What is backpropagation? How does it work? Why do we need it? The Backpropagation algorithm looks for the minimum value of the error function in weight space using a technique called the delta rule or gradient descent. The weights that minimize the error function is then considered to be a solution to the learning problem.

We need backpropogation because,

Calculate the error Ã¢ÂÂ How far is your model output from the actual output.
Minimum Error Ã¢ÂÂ Check whether the error is minimized or not.
Update the parameters Ã¢ÂÂ If the error is huge then, update the parameters (weights and biases). After that again check the error.
Repeat the process until the error becomes minimum.
Model is ready to make a prediction Ã¢ÂÂ Once the error becomes minimum, you can feed some inputs to your model and it will produce the output."
"Which optimization techniques for training neural nets do you know? Gradient Descent
Stochastic Gradient Descent
Mini-Batch Gradient Descent(best among gradient descents)
Nesterov Accelerated Gradient
Momentum
Adagrad
AdaDelta
Adam(best one. less time, more efficient)"
"How do we use SGD (stochastic gradient descent) for training a neural net? SGD approximates the expectation with few randomly selected samples (instead of the full data). In comparison to batch gradient descent, we can efficiently approximate the expectation in large data sets using SGD. For neural networks this reduces the training time a lot even considering that it will converge later as the random sampling adds noise to the gradient descent."
"WhatÃ¢ÂÂs the learning rate? The learning rate is an important hyperparameter that controls how quickly the model is adapted to the problem during the training. It can be seen as the ""step width"" during the parameter updates, i.e. how far the weights are moved into the direction of the minimum of our optimization problem."
How to set the learning rate? There is no straightforward way of finding an optimum learning rate for a model. It involves a lot of hit and trial. Usually starting with a small values such as 0.01 is a good starting point for setting a learning rate and further tweaking it so that it doesn't overshoot or converge too slowly.
"What is Adam? WhatÃ¢ÂÂs the main difference between Adam and SGD? Adam (Adaptive Moment Estimation) is a optimization technique for training neural networks. on an average, it is the best optimizer .It works with momentums of first and second order. The intuition behind the Adam is that we donÃ¢ÂÂt want to roll so fast just because we can jump over the minimum, we want to decrease the velocity a little bit for a careful search.

Adam tends to converge faster, while SGD often converges to more optimal solutions. SGD's high variance disadvantages gets rectified by Adam (as advantage for Adam)."
"When would you use Adam and when SGD? Adam tends to converge faster, while SGD often converges to more optimal solutions."
How do we decide when to stop training a neural net? Simply stop training when the validation error is the minimum.
What is model checkpointing? Saving the weights learned by a model mid training for long running processes is known as model checkpointing so that you can resume your training from a certain checkpoint.
"WhatÃ¢ÂÂs a convolutional layer? The idea of the convolutional layer is the assumption that the information needed for making a decision often is spatially close and thus, it only takes the weighted sum over nearby inputs. It also assumes that the networksÃ¢ÂÂ kernels can be reused for all nodes, hence the number of weights can be drastically reduced. To counteract only one feature being learnt per layer, multiple kernels are applied to the input which creates parallel channels in the output. Consecutive layers can also be stacked to allow the network to find more high-level features."
"Why do we actually need convolutions? CanÃ¢ÂÂt we use fully-connected layers for that? A fully-connected layer needs one weight per inter-layer connection, which means the number of weights which needs to be computed quickly balloons as the number of layers and nodes per layer is increased."
"WhatÃ¢ÂÂs pooling in CNN? Why do we need it? Pooling is a technique to downsample the feature map. It allows layers which receive relatively undistorted versions of the input to learn low level features such as lines, while layers deeper in the model can learn more abstract features such as texture.
"
"How does max pooling work? Are there other pooling techniques? Max pooling is a technique where the maximum value of a receptive field is passed on in the next feature map. The most commonly used receptive field is 2 x 2 with a stride of 2, which means the feature map is downsampled from N x N to N/2 x N/2. Receptive fields larger than 3 x 3 are rarely employed as too much information is lost.

Other pooling techniques include:

Average pooling, the output is the average value of the receptive field.
Min pooling, the output is the minimum value of the receptive field.
Global pooling, where the receptive field is set to be equal to the input size, this means the output is equal to a scalar and can be used to reduce the dimensionality of the feature map."
"Are CNNs resistant to rotations? What happens to the predictions of a CNN if an image is rotated? CNNs are not resistant to rotation by design. However, we can make our models resistant by augmenting our datasets with different rotations of the raw data. The predictions of a CNN will change if an image is rotated and we did not augment our dataset accordingly."
"What are augmentations? Why do we need them? Augmentations are an artifical way of expanding the existing datasets by performing some transformations, color shifts or many other things on the data. It helps in diversifying the data and even increasing the data when there is scarcity of data for a model to train on."
"What kind of augmentations do you know? There are many kinds of augmentations which can be used according to the type of data you are working on some of which are geometric and numerical transformation, PCA, cropping, padding, shifting, noise injection etc."
"How to choose which augmentations to use? Augmentations really depend on the type of output classes and the features you want your model to learn. For eg. if you have mostly properly illuminated images in your dataset and want your model to predict poorly illuminated images too, you can apply channel shifting on your data and include the resultant images in your dataset for better results."
"What kind of CNN architectures for classification do you know? Image Classification

Inception v3
Xception
DenseNet
AlexNet
VGG16
ResNet
SqueezeNet
EfficientNet
MobileNet
The last three are designed so they use smaller number of parameters which is helpful for edge AI."
"What is transfer learning? How does it work? Given a source domain D_S and learning task T_S, a target domain D_T and learning task T_T, transfer learning aims to help improve the learning of the target predictive function f_T in D_T using the knowledge in D_S and T_S, where D_S Ã¢ÂÂ  D_T,or T_S Ã¢ÂÂ  T_T. In other words, transfer learning enables to reuse knowledge coming from other domains or learning tasks.

In the context of CNNs, we can use networks that were pre-trained on popular datasets such as ImageNet. We then can use the weights of the layers that learn to represent features and combine them with a new set of layers that learns to map the feature representations to the given classes. Two popular strategies are either to freeze the layers that learn the feature representations completely, or to give them a smaller learning rate."
"What is bag of words? How we can use it for text classification? Bag of Words is a representation of text that describes the occurrence of words within a document. The order or structure of the words is not considered. For text classification, we look at the histogram of the words within the text and consider each word count as a feature."
"What are the advantages and disadvantages of bag of words? Advantages:

Simple to understand and implement.
Disadvantages:

The vocabulary requires careful design, most specifically in order to manage the size, which impacts the sparsity of the document representations.
Sparse representations are harder to model both for computational reasons (space and time complexity) and also for information reasons
Discarding word order ignores the context, and in turn meaning of words in the document. Context and meaning can offer a lot to the model, that if modeled could tell the difference between the same words differently arranged (Ã¢ÂÂthis is interestingÃ¢ÂÂ vs Ã¢ÂÂis this interestingÃ¢ÂÂ), synonyms (Ã¢ÂÂold bikeÃ¢ÂÂ vs Ã¢ÂÂused bikeÃ¢ÂÂ)."
What are N-grams? How can we use them? The function to tokenize into consecutive sequences of words is called n-grams. It can be used to find out N most co-occurring words (how often word X is followed by word Y) in a given sentence.
"What is TF-IDF? How is it useful for text classification? Term Frequency (TF) is a scoring of the frequency of the word in the current document. Inverse Document Frequency(IDF) is a scoring of how rare the word is across documents. It is used in scenario where highly recurring words may not contain as much informational content as the domain specific words. For example, words like Ã¢ÂÂtheÃ¢ÂÂ that are frequent across all documents therefore need to be less weighted. The TF-IDF score highlights words that are distinct (contain useful information) in a given document."
Would you prefer gradient boosting trees model or logistic regression when doing text classification with bag of words? Usually logistic regression is better because bag of words creates a matrix with large number of columns. For a huge number of columns logistic regression is usually faster than gradient boosting trees.
"If you have a sentence with multiple words, you may need to combine multiple word embeddings into one. How would you do it? Approaches ranked from simple to more complex:

Take an average over all words
Take a weighted average over all words. Weighting can be done by inverse document frequency (idf part of tf-idf).
Use ML model like LSTM or Transformer."
"Do you know how K-means works? Partition points into k subsets.
Compute the seed points as the new centroids of the clusters of the current partitioning.
Assign each point to the cluster with the nearest seed point.
Go back to step 2 or stop when the assignment does not change."
"How to select K for K-means? Domain knowledge, i.e. an expert knows the value of k
Elbow method: compute the clusters for different values of k, for each k, calculate the total within-cluster sum of square, plot the sum according to the number of clusters and use the band as the number of clusters.
Average silhouette method: compute the clusters for different values of k, for each k, calculate the average silhouette of observations, plot the silhouette according to the number of clusters and select the maximum as the number of clusters."
"What are the other clustering algorithms do you know? k-medoids: Takes the most central point instead of the mean value as the center of the cluster. This makes it more robust to noise.
Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering (AHC): hierarchical clusters combining the nearest clusters starting with each point as its own cluster.
DIvisive ANAlysis Clustering (DIANA): hierarchical clustering starting with one cluster containing all points and splitting the clusters until each point describes its own cluster.
Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN): Cluster defined as maximum set of density-connected points."
"Do you know how DBScan works? Two input parameters epsilon (neighborhood radius) and minPts (minimum number of points in an epsilon-neighborhood)
Cluster defined as maximum set of density-connected points.
Points p_j and p_i are density-connected w.r.t. epsilon and minPts if there is a point o such that both, i and j are density-reachable from o w.r.t. epsilon and minPts.
p_j is density-reachable from p_i w.r.t. epsilon, minPts if there is a chain of points p_i -> p_i+1 -> p_i+x = p_j such that p_i+x is directly density-reachable from p_i+x-1.
p_j is a directly density-reachable point of the neighborhood of p_i if dist(p_i,p_j) <= epsilon."
"When would you choose K-means and when DBScan? DBScan is more robust to noise.
DBScan is better when the amount of clusters is difficult to guess.
K-means has a lower complexity, i.e. it will be much faster, especially with a larger amount of points."
"What is the curse of dimensionality? Why do we care about it? Data in only one dimension is relatively tightly packed. Adding a dimension stretches the points across that dimension, pushing them further apart. Additional dimensions spread the data even further making high dimensional data extremely sparse. We care about it, because it is difficult to use machine learning in sparse spaces."
"Do you know any dimensionality reduction techniques? Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
T-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)
Autoencoders
Fourier and Wavelet Transforms"
"WhatÃ¢ÂÂs singular value decomposition? How is it typically used for machine learning? Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is a general matrix decomposition method that factors a matrix X into three matrices L (left singular values), ÃÂ£ (diagonal matrix) and R^T (right singular values).
For machine learning, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is typically used. It is a special type of SVD where the singular values correspond to the eigenvectors and the values of the diagonal matrix are the squares of the eigenvalues. We use these features as they are statistically descriptive.
Having calculated the eigenvectors and eigenvalues, we can use the Kaiser-Guttman criterion, a scree plot or the proportion of explained variance to determine the principal components (i.e. the final dimensionality) that are useful for dimensionality reduction."
"What is precision and recall at k? Precision at k and recall at k are evaluation metrics for ranking algorithms. Precision at k shows the share of relevant items in the first k results of the ranking algorithm. And Recall at k indicates the share of relevant items returned in top k results out of all correct answers for a given query.

Example: For a search query ""Car"" there are 3 relevant products in your shop. Your search algorithm returns 2 of those relevant products in the first 5 search results. Precision at 5 = # num of relevant products in search result / k = 2/5 = 40% Recall at 5 = # num of relevant products in search result / # num of all relevant products = 2/3 = 66.6%"
"What are good baselines when building a recommender system? A good recommer system should give relevant and personalized information.
It should not recommend items the user knows well or finds easily.
It should make diverse suggestions.
A user should explore new items."
"What is collaborative filtering? Collaborative filtering is the most prominent approach to generate recommendations.
It uses the wisdom of the crowd, i.e. it gives recommendations based on the experience of others.
A recommendation is calculated as the average of other experiences.
Say we want to give a score that indicates how much user u will like an item i. Then we can calculate it with the experience of N other users U as r_ui = 1/N * sum(v in U) r_vi.
In order to rate similar experiences with a higher weight, we can introduce a similarity between users that we use as a multiplier for each rating.
Also, as users have an individual profile, one user may have an average rating much larger than another user, so we use normalization techniques (e.g. centering or Z-score normalization) to remove the users' biases.
Collaborative filtering does only need a rating matrix as input and improves over time. However, it does not work well on sparse data, does not work for cold starts (see below) and usually tends to overfit."
"How we can incorporate implicit feedback (clicks, etc) into our recommender systems? In comparison to explicit feedback, implicit feedback datasets lack negative examples. For example, explicit feedback can be a positive or a negative rating, but implicit feedback may be the number of purchases or clicks. One popular approach to solve this problem is named weighted alternating least squares (wALS) [Hu, Y., Koren, Y., & Volinsky, C. (2008, December). Collaborative filtering for implicit feedback datasets. In Data Mining, 2008. ICDM'08. Eighth IEEE International Conference on (pp. 263-272). IEEE.]. Instead of modeling the rating matrix directly, the numbers (e.g. amount of clicks) describe the strength in observations of user actions. The model tries to find latent factors that can be used to predict the expected preference of a user for an item.
"
"What is the cold start problem? Collaborative filterung incorporates crowd knowledge to give recommendations for certain items. Say we want to recommend how much a user will like an item, we then will calculate the score using the recommendations of other users for this certain item. We can distinguish between two different ways of a cold start problem now. First, if there is a new item that has not been rated yet, we cannot give any recommendation. Also, when there is a new user, we cannot calculate a similarity to any other user."
"Possible approaches to solving the cold start problem? Content-based filtering incorporates features about items to calculate a similarity between them. In this way, we can recommend items that have a high similarity to items that a user liked already. In this way, we are not dependant on the ratings of other users for a given item anymore and solve the cold start problem for new items.
Demographic filtering incorporates user profiles to calculate a similarity between them and solves the cold start problem for new users."
"How is time series different from the usual regression problem? The principle behind causal forecasting is that the value that has to be predicted is dependant on the input features (causal factors). In time series forecasting, the to be predicted value is expected to follow a certain pattern over time."
"Which models do you know for solving time series problems? Simple Exponential Smoothing: approximate the time series with an exponentional function
Trend-Corrected Exponential Smoothing (HoltÃ¢ÂÂs Method): exponential smoothing that also models the trend
Trend- and Seasonality-Corrected Exponential Smoothing (Holt-WinterÃ¢ÂÂs Method): exponential smoothing that also models trend and seasonality
Time Series Decomposition: decomposed a time series into the four components trend, seasonal variation, cycling varation and irregular component
Autoregressive models: similar to multiple linear regression, except that the dependent variable y_t depends on its own previous values rather than other independent variables.
Deep learning approaches (RNN, LSTM, etc.)"
"If thereÃ¢ÂÂs a trend in our series, how we can remove it? And why would we want to do it? We can explicitly model the trend (and/or seasonality) with approaches such as Holt's Method or Holt-Winter's Method. We want to explicitly model the trend to reach the stationarity property for the data. Many time series approaches require stationarity. Without stationarity,the interpretation of the results of these analyses is problematic [Manuca, Radu & Savit, Robert. (1996). Stationarity and nonstationarity in time series analysis. Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena. 99. 134-161. 10.1016/S0167-2789(96)00139-X. ]."
You have a series with only one variable Ã¢ÂÂyÃ¢ÂÂ measured at time t. How do predict Ã¢ÂÂyÃ¢ÂÂ at time t+1? Which approaches would you use? We want to look at the correlation between different observations of y. This measure of correlation is called autocorrelation. Autoregressive models are multiple regression models where the time-lag series of the original time series are treated like multiple independent variables.
"You have a series with a variable Ã¢ÂÂyÃ¢ÂÂ and a set of features. How do you predict Ã¢ÂÂyÃ¢ÂÂ at t+1? Which approaches would you use? Given the assumption that the set of features gives a meaningful causation to y, a causal forecasting approach such as linear regression or multiple nonlinear regression might be useful. In case there is a lot of data and the explanability of the results is not a high priority, we can also consider deep learning approaches."
"What are the problems with using trees for solving time series problems? Random Forest models are not able to extrapolate time series data and understand increasing/decreasing trends.

"How do you choose a classifier based on a training set size? For a small training set, a model with high bias and low variance models is better, as it is less likely overfit. An example is Naive Bayes.

For a large training set, a model with low bias and high variance models is better, as it expresses more complex relationships. An example is Logistic Regression.
"
"Explain LDA for unsupervised learning.? Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a common method for topic modeling. It is a generative model for representing documents as a combination of topics, each with their own probability distribution.

LDA aims to project the features of higher dimensional space onto a lower-dimensional space. This helps to avoid the curse of dimensionality."
"How do you fix high variance in a model? If the model has low variance and high bias, we use a bagging algorithm, which divides a data set into subsets using randomized sampling. We use those samples to generate a set of models with a single learning algorithm.

Additionally, we can use the regularization technique, in which higher model coefficients are penalized to lower the complexity overall."

"What is the default method for splitting in decision trees? The default method is the Gini Index, which is the measure of impurity of a particular node. Essentially, it calculates the probability of a specific feature that is classified incorrectly. When the elements are linked by a single class, we call this Ã¢ÂÂpureÃ¢ÂÂ.

You could also use Random Forest, but the Gini Index is preferred because it isnÃ¢ÂÂt computationally intensive and doesnÃ¢ÂÂt involve logarithm functions."
"Why does XGBoost perform better than SVM? XGBoos is an ensemble method that uses many trees. This means it improves as it repeats itself.

SVM is a linear separator. So, if our data is not linearly separable, SVM requires a Kernel to get the data to a state where it can be separated. This can limit us, as there is not a perfect Kernel for every given dataset."
"For NLP, whatÃ¢ÂÂs the main purpose of using an encoder-decoder model? We use the encoder-decoder model to generate an output sequence based on an input sequence.

What makes an encoder-decoder model so powerful is that the decoder uses the final state of the encoder as its initial state. This gives the decoder access to the information that the encoder extracted from the input sequence."
"When using scikit-learn, is it true that we need to scale our feature values when they vary greatly? Yes. Most of the machine learning algorithms use Euclidean distance as the metrics to measure the distance between two data points. If the range of values is different greatly, the result of the same change in the different features will be very different."
